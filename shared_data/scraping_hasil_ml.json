    "abstract": "The expanding scale and inherent complexity of biological data have encouraged a growing use of machine learning in biology to build informative and predictive models of the underlying biological processes. All machine learning techniques fit models to data; however, the specific methods are quite varied and can at first glance seem bewildering. In this Review, we aim to provide readers with a gentle introduction to a few key machine learning techniques, including the most recently developed and widely used techniques involving deep neural networks. We describe how different techniques may be suited to specific types of biological data, and also discuss some best practices and points to consider when one is embarking on experiments involving machine learning. Some emerging directions in machine learning methodology are also discussed.",

    "title": "Review of machine learning and deep learning models for toxicity prediction.",
    "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of chemicals has raised public concerns due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment. To protect public health and the environment, it is critical to assess the toxicity of these chemicals. Traditional and toxicity assays are complicated, costly, and time-consuming and may face ethical issues. These constraints raise the need for alternative methods for assessing the toxicity of chemicals. Recently, due to the advancement of machine learning algorithms and the increase in computational power, many toxicity prediction models have been developed using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as support vector machine, random forest, -nearest neighbors, ensemble learning, and deep neural network. This review summarizes the machine learning- and deep learning-based toxicity prediction models developed in recent years. Support vector machine and random forest are the most popular machine learning algorithms, and hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and carcinogenicity are the frequently modeled toxicity endpoints in predictive toxicology. It is known that datasets impact model performance. The quality of datasets used in the development of toxicity prediction models using machine learning and deep learning is vital to the performance of the developed models. The different toxicity assignments for the same chemicals among different datasets of the same type of toxicity have been observed, indicating benchmarking datasets is needed for developing reliable toxicity prediction models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This review provides insights into current machine learning models in predictive toxicology, which are expected to promote the development and application of toxicity prediction models in the future.",

Supervised machine learning approaches that rely on simulated training data have been used to infer tree topologies and branch lengths, to select substitution models, and to perform downstream inferences of introgression and diversification. Here, we review how researchers have used several promising machine learning approaches to make phylogenetic inferences. Despite the promise of these methods, several barriers prevent supervised machine learning from reaching its full potential in phylogenetics. We discuss these barriers and potential paths forward.

    "title": "Machine fault detection methods based on machine learning algorithms: A review.",
    "abstract": "Preventive identification of mechanical parts failures has always played a crucial role in machine maintenance. Over time, as the processing cycles are repeated, the machinery in the production system is subject to wear with a consequent loss of technical efficiency compared to optimal conditions. These conditions can, in some cases, lead to the breakage of the elements with consequent stoppage of the production process pending the replacement of the element. This situation entails a large loss of turnover on the part of the company. For this reason, it is crucial to be able to predict failures in advance to try to replace the element before its wear can cause a reduction in machine performance. Several systems have recently been developed for the preventive faults detection that use a combination of low-cost sensors and algorithms based on machine learning. In this work the different methodologies for the identification of the most common mechanical failures are examined and the most widely applied algorithms based on machine learning are analyzed: Support Vector Machine (SVM) solutions, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applications, and Deep Generative Systems. These topics have been described in detail and the works most appreciated by the scientific community have been reviewed to highlight the strengths in identifying faults and to outline the directions for future challenges.",

Although all machine learning methods aim to fit models to data, the methodologies used can vary greatly and may seem daunting at first. A comprehensive review of various machine learning algorithms per biomedical applications is presented. The key concepts of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning, feature selection, and evaluation metrics. Technical insights on the major machine learning methods such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors are analyzed. Next, the dimensionality reduction methods like principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding methods, and their applications in biomedical data analysis were reviewed. Moreover, in biomedical applications predominantly feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are utilized. In addition, the identification of emerging directions in machine learning methodology will serve as a useful reference for individuals involved in biomedical research, clinical practice, and related professions who are interested in understanding and applying machine learning algorithms in their research or practice.",

    "abstract": "Objective assessment of an athlete's performance is of importance in elite sports to facilitate detailed analysis. The implementation of automated detection and recognition of sport-specific movements overcomes the limitations associated with manual performance analysis methods. The object of this study was to systematically review the literature on machine and deep learning for sport-specific movement recognition using inertial measurement unit (IMU) and, or computer vision data inputs. A search of multiple databases was undertaken. Included studies must have investigated a sport-specific movement and analysed via machine or deep learning methods for model development. A total of 52 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data pre-processing, processing, model development and evaluation methods varied across the studies. Model development for movement recognition were predominantly undertaken using supervised classification approaches. A kernel form of the Support Vector Machine algorithm was used in 53% of IMU and 50% of vision-based studies. Twelve studies used a deep learning method as a form of Convolutional Neural Network algorithm and one study also adopted a Long Short Term Memory architecture in their model. The adaptation of experimental set-up, data pre-processing, and model development methods are best considered in relation to the characteristics of the targeted sports movement(s).",

    "abstract": "This systematic literature review analyzes machine learning (ML)-based techniques for resource management in fog computing. Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, this paper focuses on ML and deep learning (DL) solutions. Resource management in the fog computing domain was thoroughly analyzed by identifying the key factors and constraints. A total of 68 research papers of extended versions were finally selected and included in this study. The findings highlight a strong preference for DL in addressing resource management challenges within a fog computing paradigm, i.e., 66% of the reviewed articles leveraged DL techniques, while 34% utilized ML. Key factors such as latency, energy consumption, task scheduling, and QoS are interconnected and critical for resource management optimization. The analysis reveals that latency, energy consumption, and QoS are the prime factors addressed in the literature on ML-based fog computing resource management. Latency is the most frequently addressed parameter, investigated in 77% of the articles, followed by energy consumption and task scheduling at 44% and 33%, respectively. Furthermore, according to our evaluation, an extensive range of challenges, i.e., computational resource and latency, scalability and management, data availability and quality, and model complexity and interpretability, are addressed by employing 73, 53, 45, and 46 ML/DL techniques, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to changes in lifestyle, bariatric surgery is expanding worldwide. However, this surgery has numerous complications, and early identification of these complications could be essential in assisting patients to have a higher-quality surgery. Machine learning has a significant role in prediction tasks. So far, no systematic review has been carried out on leveraging ML techniques for predicting complications of bariatric surgery. Therefore, this study aims to perform a systematic review for better prediction insight. This review was conducted in 2023 based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched scientific databases using the inclusion and exclusion criteria to obtain articles. The data extraction form was used to gather data. To analyze the data, we leveraged the narrative synthesis of the quantitative data. Ensemble algorithms outperformed others in large databases, especially at the national registries. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) performed better than others based on one-single-center database. Also, Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and ANN obtained favorable performance for complications such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, thrombosis, leakage, and depression.

A Dataset of digital panoramic radiographs of three dental implant systems were obtained. The images were divided into two datasets: one for training and another for testing of the machine learning models. Machine learning algorithms namely, support vector machine, logistic regression, K Nearest neighbor and X boost classifiers were trained to classify implant systems from radiographs, based on the shape using Hu and Eigen values. Performance of algorithms was evaluated by its classification accuracy using the test dataset. Accuracy and recover operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated to analyze the performance of the model. The classifiers tested in the study were able to identify the implant systems with an average accuracy of 0.67. Of the classifiers trained, logistic regression showed best overall performance followed by SVM, KNN and X boost classifiers. Machine learning models tested in the study are proficient enough to identify dental implant systems; hence we are proposing machine learning as a method for implant identification and can be generalized with a larger dataset and more cross sectional studies.",

    "title": "Objective Supervised Machine Learning-Based Classification and Inference of Biological Neuronal Networks.",
    "abstract": "The classification of biological neuron types and networks poses challenges to the full understanding of the human brain's organisation and functioning. In this paper, we develop a novel objective classification model of biological neuronal morphology and electrical types and their networks, based on the attributes of neuronal communication using supervised machine learning solutions. This presents advantages compared to the existing approaches in neuroinformatics since the data related to mutual information or delay between neurons obtained from spike trains are more abundant than conventional morphological data. We constructed two open-access computational platforms of various neuronal circuits from the Blue Brain Project realistic models, named Neurpy and Neurgen. Then, we investigated how we could perform network tomography with cortical neuronal circuits for the morphological, topological and electrical classification of neurons. We extracted the simulated data of 10,000 network topology combinations with five layers, 25 morphological type (m-type) cells, and 14 electrical type (e-type) cells. We applied the data to several different classifiers (including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks). We achieved accuracies of up to 70%, and the inference of biological network structures using network tomography reached up to 65% of accuracy. Objective classification of biological networks can be achieved with cascaded machine learning methods using neuron communication data. SVM methods seem to perform better amongst used techniques. Our research not only contributes to existing classification efforts but sets the road-map for future usage of brain-machine interfaces towards an in vivo objective classification of neurons as a sensing mechanism of the brain's structure.",

Stepwise simplification of the model shows the expected decrease in accuracy, but a naive model with thresholding of a single extracted feature (relative wavelet energy) is still able to achieve 75%, which remains strongly above the random guess baseline of 54%.

The major challenge was to develop a non-faulty framework to detect meddling (to overcome the traditional ways). With the development of machine learning technology, detecting and stopping the meddling process in the early stages is much easier. In this study, the proposed framework uses numerous data collection and processing techniques and machine learning techniques to train the meddling data and detect anomalies. The proposed framework uses support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithms to detect the meddling in a network entangled with blockchain technology to ensure the privacy and protection of models as well as communication data. SVM achieves the highest training detection accuracy (DA) and misclassification rate (MCR) of 99.59% and 0.41%, respectively, and SVM achieves the highest-testing DA and MCR of 99.05% and 0.95%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Neonatal infants communicate with us through cries. The infant cry signals have distinct patterns depending on the purpose of the cries. Preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature selection need expert attention and take much effort in audio signals in recent days. In deep learning techniques, it automatically extracts and selects the most important features. For this, it requires an enormous amount of data for effective classification. This work mainly discriminates the neonatal cries into pain, hunger, and sleepiness. The neonatal cry auditory signals are transformed into a spectrogram image by utilizing the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) technique. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) technique takes the spectrogram images for input. The features are obtained from the convolutional neural network and are passed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Machine learning technique classifies neonatal cries. This work combines the advantages of machine learning and deep learning techniques to get the best results even with a moderate number of data samples. The experimental result shows that CNN-based feature extraction and SVM classifier provides promising results. While comparing the SVM-based kernel techniques, namely radial basis function (RBF), linear and polynomial, it is found that SVM-RBF provides the highest accuracy of kernel-based infant cry classification system provides 88.89% accuracy.",

    "title": "Performance comparison of deep learning and machine learning methods in determining wetland water areas using EuroSAT dataset.",
    "abstract": "Wetlands are critical to the ecology because they maintain biodiversity and provide home for a variety of species. Researching, mapping, and conservation of wetlands is a challenging and time-consuming process. Because they produce temporal and geographical information, remote sensing and photogrammetric approaches are useful tools for analyzing and managing wetlands. In this study, the water areas of five different wetlands obtained with Sentinel-2 images in Turkey were classified. Although obtaining large amounts of high-dimensional dataset labeled for various land types is costly, it is a significant advantage to use it after model training in a wide range of applications. In this paper, the EuroSAT dataset was used in the validation process. Proposed deep learning-based 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and traditional machine learning methods (i.e., support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighborhood, canonical correlation forests, and AdaBoost.M1) were compared quantitatively (i.e., accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, F-score, and image quality assessment metrics) and qualitatively. Finally, pairwise comparison was made with chi-square-based McNemar's test. There is a statistical difference between 1D CNN and machine learning method (except the support vector machine vs linear discriminant analysis in Test 1 area). CNN models outperform machine learning algorithms in terms of non-linear function approximation and the ability to extract and articulate data features. Since 1D CNNs can process data in a highly complex and unique feature space, they are very successful in segmenting strongly related and highly correlated discrete signals. It also has advantages over machine learning methods for water body extraction in that it can be integrated with sophisticated image pre-processing and standardization tools, is less susceptible to low-level random noise, and provides shift in variations and contrast-invariant image local transforms.",

As a consequence, they have been extensively applied in the medical field. HSI is being combined with machine learning (ML) processes to obtain models to assist in diagnosis. In particular, the combination of these techniques has proven to be a reliable aid in the differentiation of healthy and tumor tissue during brain tumor surgery. ML algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to make predictions and provide in-vivo visualizations that may assist neurosurgeons in being more precise, hence reducing damages to healthy tissue. In this work, thirteen in-vivo hyperspectral images from twelve different patients with high-grade gliomas (grade III and IV) have been selected to train SVM, RF and CNN classifiers. Five different classes have been defined during the experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Overall accuracy (OACC) results vary from 60% to 95% depending on the training conditions. Finally, as far as the contribution of each band to the OACC is concerned, the results obtained in this work are 3.81 times greater than those reported in the literature.",

    "title": "Hyperspectral imaging for chemicals identification: a human-inspired machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Data analysis has increasingly relied on machine learning in recent years. Since machines implement mathematical algorithms without knowing the physical nature of the problem, they may be accurate but lack the flexibility to move across different domains. This manuscript presents a machine-educating approach where a machine is equipped with a physical model, universal building blocks, and an unlabeled dataset from which it derives its decision criteria. Here, the concept of machine education is deployed to identify thin layers of organic materials using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The measured spectra formed a nonlinear mixture of the unknown background materials and the target material spectra. The machine was educated to resolve this nonlinear mixing and identify the spectral signature of the target materials. The inputs for educating and testing the machine were a nonlinear mixing model, the spectra of the pure target materials (which are problem invariant), and the unlabeled HSI data. The educated machine is accurate, and its generalization capabilities outperform classical machines. When using the educated machine, the number of falsely identified samples is ~ 100 times lower than the classical machine. The probability for detection with the educated machine is 96% compared to 90% with the classical machine.",

    "title": "Learning in the machine: Recirculation is random backpropagation.",
    "abstract": "Learning in physical neural systems must rely on learning rules that are local in both space and time. Optimal learning in deep neural architectures requires that non-local information be available to the deep synapses. Thus, in general, optimal learning in physical neural systems requires the presence of a deep learning channel to communicate non-local information to deep synapses, in a direction opposite to the forward propagation of the activities. Theoretical arguments suggest that for circular autoencoders, an important class of neural architectures where the output layer is identical to the input layer, alternative algorithms may exist that enable local learning without the need for additional learning channels, by using the forward activation channel as the deep learning channel. Here we systematically identify, classify, and study several such local learning algorithms, based on the general idea of recirculating information from the output layer to the hidden layers. We show through simulations and mathematical derivations that these algorithms are robust and converge to critical points of the global error function. In most cases, we show that these recirculation algorithms are very similar to an adaptive form of random backpropagation, where each hidden layer receives a linearly transformed, slowly-varying, version of the output error.",

    "abstract": "Investigators have recently introduced powerful methods for population genetic inference that rely on supervised machine learning from simulated data. Despite their performance advantages, these methods can fail when the simulated training data does not adequately resemble data from the real world. Here, we show that this \"simulation mis-specification\" problem can be framed as a \"domain adaptation\" problem, where a model learned from one data distribution is applied to a dataset drawn from a different distribution. By applying an established domain-adaptation technique based on a gradient reversal layer (GRL), originally introduced for image classification, we show that the effects of simulation mis-specification can be substantially mitigated. We focus our analysis on two state-of-the-art deep-learning population genetic methods-SIA, which infers positive selection from features of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), and ReLERNN, which infers recombination rates from genotype matrices. In the case of SIA, the domain adaptive framework also compensates for ARG inference error. Using the domain-adaptive SIA (dadaSIA) model, we estimate improved selection coefficients at selected loci in the 1000 Genomes CEU population. We anticipate that domain adaptation will prove to be widely applicable in the growing use of supervised machine learning in population genetics.",

    "title": "Classification of EEG evoked in 2D and 3D virtual reality: traditional machine learning versus deep learning.",
    "abstract": ". Virtual reality (VR) simulates real-life events and scenarios and is widely utilized in education, entertainment, and medicine. VR can be presented in two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), with 3D VR offering a more realistic and immersive experience. Previous research has shown that electroencephalogram (EEG) profiles induced by 3D VR differ from those of 2D VR in various aspects, including brain rhythm power, activation, and functional connectivity. However, studies focused on classifying EEG in 2D and 3D VR contexts remain limited. . A 56-channel EEG was recorded while visual stimuli were presented in 2D and 3D VR. The recorded EEG signals were classified using two machine learning approaches: traditional machine learning and deep learning. In the traditional approach, features such as power spectral density (PSD) and common spatial patterns (CSP) were extracted, and three classifiers-support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forests (RF)-were used. For the deep learning approach, a specialized convolutional neural network, EEGNet, was employed. The classification performance of these methods was then compared. . In terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, the deep learning method outperformed traditional machine learning approaches. Specifically, the classification accuracy using the EEGNet deep learning model reached up to 97.86%. . EEGNet-based deep learning significantly outperforms conventional machine learning methods in classifying EEG signals induced by 2D and 3D VR. Given EEGNet's design for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI), this superior classification performance suggests that it can enhance the application of 3D VR in BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to explore the Painting Classification in art teaching under Machine Learning. Based on Emotional Semantics and Machine Learning, the Emotional Semantics of the traditional image are expounded. Firstly, Emotional Semantics are applied to figure painting in art teaching. Then, the convolutional sparse automatic encoder model is introduced in Painting Classification. Finally, the accuracies of the Painting Classification of the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVMC) and that of the Naive Bayes classifier are compared, and the relevant conclusions are drawn. The accuracy of Painting Classification is positively correlated with the scale of painting. After analysis, the painting set is classified in a ratio of 2 : 1, with 2/3 as training set and 1/3 as test set, which is conducive to the good accuracy of classification. In Machine Learning, proper whitening can improve the accuracy of Painting Classification to a certain extent. However, when the whitening treatment coefficient is selected, it cannot be too large, and the average pooling is more accurate than maximum pooling. After the comparison of the new SVMC, the Naive Bayes classifier, and the convolutional sparse automatic encoder, the convolutional sparse automatic encoder has the highest accuracy of Painting Classification. Therefore, the Painting Classification in art teaching under Machine Learning is explored, which is of great help to the classification work of students or teachers in the future.",

Traditionally, identifying these proteins is a challenging and time-consuming process due to their species-specific variability and complexity. Leveraging advancements in computational biology, we present PROTA, a novel tool that combines machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict protamines with high accuracy. For the first time, we integrate Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with supervised learning methods to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of protamine prediction. Our methodology evaluated multiple ML models, including Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LIGHTGBM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Radial Basis Function-Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM). During ten-fold cross-validation on our training dataset, the MLP model with GAN-augmented data demonstrated superior performance metrics: 0.997 accuracy, 0.997 F1 score, 0.998 precision, 0.997 sensitivity, and 1.0 AUC. In the independent testing phase, this model achieved 0.999 accuracy, 0.999 F1 score, 1.0 precision, 0.999 sensitivity, and 1.0 AUC. These results establish PROTA, accessible via a user-friendly web application. We anticipate that PROTA will be a crucial resource for researchers, enabling the rapid and reliable prediction of protamines, thereby advancing our understanding of their roles in reproductive biology, biotechnology, and medicine.",

Second, we introduce the concept of institutional trustworthiness based on an expansion of Hawley's commitment account.

    "abstract": "The assessment of food and industrial crops during harvesting is important to determine the quality and downstream processing requirements, which in turn affect their market value. While machine learning models have been developed for this purpose, their deployment is hindered by the high cost of labelling the crop images to provide data for model training. This study examines the capabilities of semi-supervised and active learning to minimise effort when labelling cotton lint samples while maintaining high classification accuracy. Random forest classification models were developed using supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and active learning to determine Egyptian cotton grade. Compared to supervised learning (80.20-82.66%) and semi-supervised learning (81.39-85.26%), active learning models were able to achieve higher accuracy (82.85-85.33%) with up to 46.4% reduction in the volume of labelled data required. The primary obstacle when using machine learning for Egyptian cotton grading is the time required for labelling cotton lint samples. However, by applying active learning, this study successfully decreased the time needed from 422.5 to 177.5 min. The findings of this study demonstrate that active learning is a promising approach for developing accurate and efficient machine learning models for grading food and industrial crops.",

Early prediction of functional outcomes is essential for optimizing treatment strategies. A multicenter study was conducted using data collected from 718 patients with aSAH who were treated at five hospitals in Japan. A deep learning model was developed to predict outcomes based on modified Rankin Scale scores using pretherapy clinical data collected from admission to the initiation of physical therapy. The model's performance was assessed using the area under the curve, and interpretability was enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Logistic regression analysis was also performed for further validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.90, with age, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, and higher brain dysfunction identified as key predictors. SHAP analysis supported the importance of these features in the prediction model, and logistic regression analysis further confirmed the model's robustness. The novel deep learning model demonstrated strong predictive performance in determining functional outcomes in patients with aSAH, making it a valuable tool for guiding early rehabilitation strategies.",

Currently, improving machine learning performance for small scientific datasets remains a major challenge in many academic fields, such as bioinformatics or medical science. Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is typically optimal for small datasets, while deep learning often performs better for large datasets. This work reports a boosting tree-assisted multitask deep learning (BTAMDL) architecture that integrates GBDT and multitask deep learning (MDL) to achieve near-optimal predictions for small datasets when there exists a large dataset that is well correlated to the small datasets. Two BTAMDL models are constructed, one utilizing purely MDL output as GBDT input while the other admitting additional features in GBDT input. The proposed BTAMDL models are validated on four categories of datasets, including toxicity, partition coefficient, solubility, and solvation. It is found that the proposed BTAMDL models outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in various applications involving small datasets.",

We first estimated the water quality index (WQI) to model seven water quality parameters: total hardness (TH), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg). Then six independent factors were utilized (i.e. Precipitation (Pr), Maximum Temperature (Tmax), Minimum Temperature (Tmin), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)) for predicting the WQI mapping through the different ML models. This study demonstrated that the SE-Cubist model outperforms other ML models. During the testing phase, it achieved the best modeling results with an R = 0.975, RMSE = 0.351, and MAE = 0.197. The ReliefF and SHAP analyses identified Pr and Tmax as the most significant factors influencing WQI within the study area.",

However, complex models which handle private and sometimes protected data, raise concerns about the potential leak of identifiable data. In this work, we focus on the case of a deep network model trained on images of individual faces. A previously published deep learning model, trained to estimate the gaze from full-face image sequences was stress tested for personal information leakage by a white box inference attack. Full-face video recordings taken from 493 individuals undergoing an eye-tracking- based evaluation of neurological function were used. Outputs, gradients, intermediate layer outputs, loss, and labels were used as inputs for a deep network with an added support vector machine emission layer to recognize membership in the training data. The inference attack method and associated mathematical analysis indicate that there is a low likelihood of unintended memorization of facial features in the deep learning model. In this study, it is showed that the named model preserves the integrity of training data with reasonable confidence. The same process can be implemented in similar conditions for different models.",

    "title": "Biomedical image classification made easier thanks to transfer and semi-supervised learning.",
    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques are the state-of-the-art approach to solve image classification problems in biomedicine; however, they require the acquisition and annotation of a considerable volume of images. In addition, using deep learning libraries and tuning the hyperparameters of the networks trained with them might be challenging for several users. These drawbacks prevent the adoption of these techniques outside the machine-learning community. In this work, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) method to deal with these problems. Our AutoML method combines transfer learning with a new semi-supervised learning procedure to train models when few annotated images are available. In order to facilitate the dissemination of our method, we have implemented it as an open-source tool called ATLASS. Finally, we have evaluated our method with two benchmarks of biomedical image classification datasets. Our method has been thoroughly tested both with small datasets and partially annotated biomedical datasets; and, it outperforms, both in terms of speed and accuracy, the existing AutoML tools when working with small datasets; and, might improve the accuracy of models up to a 10% when working with partially annotated datasets. The work presented in this paper allows the use of deep learning techniques to solve an image classification problem with few resources. Namely, it is possible to train deep models with small, and partially annotated datasets of images. In addition, we have proven that our AutoML method outperforms other AutoML tools both in terms of accuracy and speed when working with small datasets.",

    "abstract": "Twin support vector machine (TSVM) is a practical machine learning algorithm, whereas traditional TSVM can be limited for data with outliers or noises. To address this problem, we propose a novel TSVM with the symmetric LINEX loss function (SLTSVM) for robust classification. There are several advantages of our method: (1) The performance of the proposed SLTSVM for data with outliers or noise can be improved by using the symmetric LINEX loss function. (2) The introduction of regularization term can effectively improve the generalization ability of our model. (3) An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problems of our SLTSVM. (4) The convergence and time complexity of the iterative algorithm are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, our model does not involve loss function parameter, which makes our method more competitive. Experimental results on synthetic, benchmark and image datasets with label noises and feature noises demonstrate that our proposed method slightly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on most datasets.",

In this work, we focus on the label propagation problem in multilayer networks.

We propose a novel boundary-based heat diffusion algorithm that guarantees a closed-form solution with an efficient implementation. We experimentally validated our method on synthetic networks and five real-world multilayer network datasets representing scientific coauthorship, spreading drug adoption among physicians, two bibliographic networks, and a movie network.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made tremendous successes in numerous artificial intelligence applications and is unsurprisingly penetrating into various biomedical domains. High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices, such as transcriptomes and metabolomes, have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Using 37 high throughput omics datasets, covering transcriptomes and metabolomes, we evaluated the classification power of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods. Representative deep learning methods, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were deployed and explored in seeking optimal architectures for the best classification performance. Together with five classical supervised classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), MLP and CNN were comparatively tested on the 37 datasets to predict disease stages or to discriminate diseased samples from normal samples. MLPs achieved the highest overall accuracy among all methods tested. More thorough analyses revealed that single hidden layer MLPs with ample hidden units outperformed deeper MLPs. Furthermore, MLP was one of the most robust methods against imbalanced class composition and inaccurate class labels. Our results concluded that shallow MLPs (of one or two hidden layers) with ample hidden neurons are sufficient to achieve superior and robust classification performance in exploiting numerical matrix-formed omics data for diagnosis purpose. Specific observations regarding optimal network width, class imbalance tolerance, and inaccurate labeling tolerance will inform future improvement of neural network applications on functional genomics data.",

    "title": "Engineering Features From Advanced Medical Technology Initiative Submissions to Enable Predictive Modeling for Proposal Success.",
    "abstract": "The U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center Advanced Medical Technology Initiative (AMTI) demonstrate key emerging technologies related to military medicine. AMTI invites researchers to submit proposals for short-term funding opportunities that support this goal. AMTI proposal selection is guided by a time-intensive peer review process, where proposals are rated on innovation, military relevance, metrics for success, and return on investment. Utilizing machine learning (ML) could assist in proposal evaluations by learning relationships between proposal performance and proposal features. This research explores the viability of artificial intelligence/ML for predicting proposal ratings given content-based proposal features. Although not meant to replace experts, a model-based approach to evaluating proposal quality could work alongside experts to provide a fast, minimally biased estimate of proposal performance. This article presents initial stages of a project aiming to use ML to prioritize research proposals. The initial steps included a literature review to identify potential features. Then, these features were extracted from a dataset consisting of past proposals submissions. The dataset includes 824 proposals submitted to the AMTI program from 2010 to 2022. The analysis will inform a discussion of anticipated next steps toward developing a ML model. The following features were created for future modeling: requested funds; word count by section; readability by section; citations and partners identified; and term frequency-inverse document frequency word vectors. This initial process identified the top ranked words (data, health, injury, device, treatment, technology, etc.) among the abstract, problem to be solved, military relevance, and metrics/outcomes text proposal fields. The analysis also evaluated the text fields for readability using the Flesch readability scale. Most proposals text fields were categorized as \"college graduate,\" indicating a challenging readability level. Finally, citations and partners were reviewed as an indicator of proposal successfulness. This research was the first stage of a larger project to explore the use of ML to predict proposal ratings for the purpose of providing automated support to proposal reviewers and to reveal the preferences and values of AMTI proposal reviewers and other decision-makers. The result of this work will provide practical insights regarding the review process for the AMTI program. This will facilitate reduction in bias for AMTI innovators and a streamlined and subjective process for AMTI administrators, which benefits the military health system overall.",

    "title": "Seismic anisotropy prediction using ML methods: A case study on an offshore carbonate oilfield.",
    "abstract": "Estimating seismic anisotropy parameters, such as Thomson's parameters, is crucial for investigating fractured and finely layered geological media. However, many inversion methods rely on complex physical models with initial assumptions, leading to non-reproducible estimates and subjective fracture interpretation. To address these limitations, this study utilizes machine learning methods: support vector regression, extreme gradient boost, multi-layer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network. The abundance of seismic features leads to many feature combinations, making the training and testing of machine learning models challenging. Therefore, a workflow has been developed to systematically inspect seismic features and select the most appropriate one for anisotropy estimation with reasonable accuracy. Synthetic data were generated using an earth model and well data within a finite difference numerical program. After thoroughly investigating synthetic data, the amplitudes of direct and reflected waves in the time and frequency domains were selected as input features to train machine learning methods. Optimizing the machine learning hyperparameters allowed the training and testing procedures to be completed with high accuracy. Subsequently, the optimized machine learning methods were used to predict Thomsen's parameters, ε and δ, of a shaley formation in the zone area. To validate the predictions, the ε and δ estimated at a well location were compared with those obtained using a physics-based model, resulting in the least relative errors ranging from 2.92% to 7.14%.",

Identification of pharmacophoric fragments provides valuable information for structure- and fragment-based design of potent and selective DYRK1A inhibitors. In this study, seven machine learning methods along with five molecular fingerprints were employed to develop qualitative classification models of DYRK1A inhibitors, which were evaluated by cross-validation, test set, and external validation set with four performance indicators of predictive classification accuracy (CA), the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and balanced accuracy (BA). The PubChem fingerprint-support vector machine model (CA = 0.909, AUC = 0.933, MCC = 0.717, BA = 0.855) and PubChem fingerprint along with the artificial neural model (CA = 0.862, AUC = 0.911, MCC = 0.705, BA = 0.870) were considered as the optimal modes for training set and test set, respectively. A hybrid data balancing method SMOTETL, a combination of synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and Tomek link (TL) algorithms, was applied to explore the impact of balanced learning on the performance of models. Based on the frequency analysis and information gain, pharmacophoric fragments related to DYRK1A inhibition were also identified.

    "abstract": "Accurate energy consumption model is the basis of energy saving optimal control of air conditioning system. The existing energy consumption model of air conditioning water system mainly focuses on a certain equipment or a part of the cycle. However, the coupling between water system equipment will affect the setting of optimal energy consumption of equipment. It is necessary to establish the energy consumption model of water system as a whole. However, air conditioning water system is a highly nonlinear complex system, and its precise physical model is difficult to establish. The main goal of this paper is to develop an accurate machine learning modeling and optimization technique to predict the total energy consumption of air conditioning water system by using the actual operation data collected. The main contributions of this work are as follows: (1) Three commonly used machine learning techniques, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and classification regression tree (CART), are used to build prediction models of air conditioning water system energy consumption. The results show that all the three models have fast training speed, but the ANN model has better performance in cross-validation. (2) The improved differential evolution algorithm was used to optimize the parameters (initial weights and thresholds) of the ANN, which solved the problem that the ANN is easy to fall into the local optimal solution. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the improved model decreases by 20.5%, the mean absolute error (MAE) decreases by 30.2%, and the coefficient of determination (R ) increases from 0.9227 to 0.9512. (3) Sensitivity analysis of the established optimization model shows that chilled water flow, chilled water outlet temperature and air conditioning load are the main factors affecting the total energy consumption.",

We generate an ensemble of models, each equally consistent with experimental data, then perform simulations with them. We apply machine learning to the simulation output to identify model structure variation that maximally influences simulations. These variants are high-priority candidates for curation through removal, addition, or reannotation in the model. We apply this approach, automated metabolic model ensemble-driven elimination of uncertainty with statistical learning (AMMEDEUS), to 29 bacterial species to improve gene essentiality predictions.

    "title": "Acceleration of Hyperspectral Skin Cancer Image Classification through Parallel Machine-Learning Methods.",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a very compelling technique in different scientific areas; indeed, many researchers use it in the fields of remote sensing, agriculture, forensics, and medicine. In the latter, HSI plays a crucial role as a diagnostic support and for surgery guidance. However, the computational effort in elaborating hyperspectral data is not trivial. Furthermore, the demand for detecting diseases in a short time is undeniable. In this paper, we take up this challenge by parallelizing three machine-learning methods among those that are the most intensively used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to accelerate the classification of hyperspectral skin cancer images. They all showed a good performance in HS image classification, in particular when the size of the dataset is limited, as demonstrated in the literature. We illustrate the parallelization techniques adopted for each approach, highlighting the suitability of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to this aim. Experimental results show that parallel SVM and XGB algorithms significantly improve the classification times in comparison with their serial counterparts.",

    "title": "\"What is relevant in a text document?\": An interpretable machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.",

We analyze the currently available models and explore key questions that arise when training and fine-tuning a transformer model for MPP. These questions encompass the choice and scale of the pretraining data, optimal architecture selections, and promising pretraining objectives.

    "title": "Machine-Learning Classification of Soil Bulk Density in Salt Marsh Environments.",
    "abstract": "Remotely sensed data from both in situ and satellite platforms in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR, 400-2500 nm) regions have been widely used to characterize and model soil properties in a direct, cost-effective, and rapid manner at different scales. In this study, we assess the performance of machine-learning algorithms including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machines (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM) to model salt marsh soil bulk density using multispectral remote-sensing data from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) platform. To our knowledge, use of remote-sensing data for estimating salt marsh soil bulk density at the vegetation rooting zone has not been investigated before. Our study reveals that blue (band 1; 450-520 nm) and NIR (band 4; 770-900 nm) bands of Landsat-7 ETM+ ranked as the most important spectral features for bulk density prediction by XGBoost and RF, respectively. According to XGBoost, band 1 and band 4 had relative importance of around 41% and 39%, respectively. We tested two soil bulk density classes in order to differentiate salt marshes in terms of their capability to support vegetation that grows in either low (0.032 to 0.752 g/cm ) or high (0.752 g/cm to 1.893 g/cm ) bulk density areas. XGBoost produced a higher classification accuracy (88%) compared to RF (87%) and SVM (86%), although discrepancies in accuracy between these models were small (<2%). XGBoost correctly classified 178 out of 186 soil samples labeled as low bulk density and 37 out of 62 soil samples labeled as high bulk density. We conclude that remote-sensing-based machine-learning models can be a valuable tool for ecologists and engineers to map the soil bulk density in wetlands to select suitable sites for effective restoration and successful re-establishment practices.",

    "abstract": "Physical and chemical parameters of river influence the habitat of fish species in aquatic ecosystems. Fish showed a complex relationship with different aquatic factors in river. Machine learning modeling is a useful tool to identify relationships between components of a complex environmental system. We identified the preferred habitat indicators of Chanda nama (a small indigenous fish), in the Krishna River located in peninsular India, using machine learning modeling. Using data on Chanda nama fish distribution (presence/absence) and associated ten physical and chemical parameters of water at 22 sampling sites of the river collected during the year 2001-2002, machine learning models such as random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors were used for classification of Chanda nama distribution in the river. The machine learning model efficiency was evaluated using classification accuracy, Cohen's kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating-characteristics. Results showed that random forest is the best model with higher classification accuracy (82%), Cohen's kappa coefficient (0.55), sensitivity (0.57), specificity (0.76), and receiver-operating-characteristics (0.72) for prediction of the occurrence of Chanda nama in the Krishna River. Random forest model identified three preferred physicochemical habitat traits such as altitude, temperature, and depth for Chanda nama distribution in Krishna River. Our results will be helpful for researcher and policy maker to understand important physical and chemical variables for sustainable management of a small indigenous fish (Chanda nama) in a large tropical river.",

    "title": "Risky Driver Recognition with Class Imbalance Data and Automated Machine Learning Framework.",
    "abstract": "Identifying high-risk drivers before an accident happens is necessary for traffic accident control and prevention. Due to the class-imbalance nature of driving data, high-risk samples as the minority class are usually ill-treated by standard classification algorithms. Instead of applying preset sampling or cost-sensitive learning, this paper proposes a novel automated machine learning framework that simultaneously and automatically searches for the optimal sampling, cost-sensitive loss function, and probability calibration to handle class-imbalance problem in recognition of risky drivers. The hyperparameters that control sampling ratio and class weight, along with other hyperparameters, are optimized by Bayesian optimization. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed automated learning framework, we establish a risky driver recognition model as a case study, using video-extracted vehicle trajectory data of 2427 private cars on a German highway. Based on rear-end collision risk evaluation, only 4.29% of all drivers are labeled as risky drivers. The inputs of the recognition model are the discrete Fourier transform coefficients of target vehicle's longitudinal speed, lateral speed, and the gap between the target vehicle and its preceding vehicle. Among 12 sampling methods, 2 cost-sensitive loss functions, and 2 probability calibration methods, the result of automated machine learning is consistent with manual searching but much more computation-efficient. We find that the combination of Support Vector Machine-based Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SVMSMOTE) sampling, cost-sensitive cross-entropy loss function, and isotonic regression can significantly improve the recognition ability and reduce the error of predicted probability.",

    "abstract": "China, the world's largest carbon emitter, plays a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality. This study systematically analyzes the impact of landscape indices on carbon emissions from rural settlements across more than 2800 counties using eight supervised machine learning models. To assess variable influences under diverse conditions, we also employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) methods. From 2000 to 2020, carbon emissions in China increased significantly, with the highest regional growth in the Northeast, surging by 259.52% to 10.199 million tons per year. After identifying the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) model as most effective, our findings reveal that the Mean Patch Area (MPA) index had a greater influence on emissions compared to Patch Density (PD), Edge Density (ED), and Aggregation Index (AI). Each index demonstrated unique impact characteristics and varied trends across different regions. These findings are crucial for crafting targeted environmental policies and advancing sustainable development goals.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules have been playing a crucial role in drug discovery; however, some exhibit nonspecific inhibitory effects during hit screening due to the formation of colloidal aggregators. Such false positives often lead to significant research costs and time investment. Therefore, to identify potential aggregating compounds efficiently and accurately at an early stage of drug discovery, we employed several machine learning techniques to develop classification models for identifying promiscuous aggregating inhibitors. Using a training dataset of 10 000 aggregators and 10 000 nonaggregators, models were trained by combining four different molecular representations with various machine learning algorithms. We found that the best-performing model is the one that employs path-based FP2 fingerprints in conjunction with the cubic support vector machine algorithm, which achieved the highest accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for both the validation and test datasets while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity levels (>0.93). Additionally, we have proposed a new model interpretation method, global sensitivity analysis (GSA), to complement the well-recognized SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis. Several comparative studies have shown that GSA is a time-efficient and accurate approach for identifying crucial descriptors that contribute to model prediction, especially in the scenario where the dataset contains a substantial number of data entries with a limited set of descriptors. Our models as well as GSA findings can provide useful guidance on screening library design to minimize false positives.",

Self-GenomeNet leverages reverse-complement sequences and effectively learns short- and long-term dependencies by predicting targets of different lengths. Self-GenomeNet performs better than other self-supervised methods in data-scarce genomic tasks and outperforms standard supervised training with ~10 times fewer labeled training data. Furthermore, the learned representations generalize well to new datasets and tasks.

In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis. In in-situ settings, flow maps are exported and interpolated in order to assess the transport characteristics of time-dependent fluids.

Timely and precise evaluation of flood impacts is critical for effective flood management and decision-making. This research demonstrates an integrated approach utilizing machine learning and Google Earth Engine to enable real-time flood assessment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and the Google Earth Engine platform were employed to generate near real-time flood maps of the 2020 flood in Kurigram and Lalmonirhat. An automatic thresholding technique quantified flooded areas. For land use/land cover (LULC) analysis, Sentinel-2's high resolution and machine learning models like artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) were leveraged. ANN delivered the best LULC mapping with 0.94 accuracy based on metrics like accuracy, kappa, mean F1 score, mean sensitivity, mean specificity, mean positive predictive value, mean negative value, mean precision, mean recall, mean detection rate and mean balanced accuracy. Results showed over 600,000 people exposed at peak inundation in July-about 17% of the population. The machine learning-enabled LULC maps reliably identified vulnerable areas to prioritize flood management. Over half of croplands flooded in July. This research demonstrates the potential of integrating SAR, machine learning and cloud computing to empower authorities through real-time monitoring and accurate LULC mapping essential for effective flood response. The proposed comprehensive methodology can assist stakeholders in developing data-driven flood management strategies to reduce impacts.",

As dermatology belongs to this field, it has the potential to play a pioneering role in the use of AI. The current use of AI for the diagnosis and follow-up of dermatoses is reviewed and the future potential of these technologies is discussed. This article is based on a selective review of the literature using Embase and MEDLINE and the keywords \"psoriasis\", \"eczema\", \"dermatoses\" and \"acne\" combined with \"artificial intelligence\", \"machine learning\", \"deep learning\", \"neural network\", \"computer-guided\", \"supervised machine learning\" or \"unsupervised machine learning\" were searched. In comparison to examiner-dependent intra- and interindividually fluctuating scores for the assessment of inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. the Psoriasis Areas Severity Index [PASI] and body surface area [BSA]), AI-based algorithms can potentially offer reproducible, standardized evaluations of these scores. Whereas promising algorithms have already been developed for the diagnosis of psoriasis, there is currently only scarce work on the use of AI in the context of eczema. The latest developments in this field show the enormous potential of AI-based diagnostics and follow-up of dermatological clinical pictures by means of an autonomous computer-based image analysis. These noninvasive, optical examination methods provide valuable additional information, but dermatological interaction remains indispensable in daily clinical practice.",

    "title": "Nondestructive Classification of Soybean Seed Varieties by Hyperspectral Imaging and Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms.",
    "abstract": "During the processing and planting of soybeans, it is greatly significant that a reliable, rapid, and accurate technique is used to detect soybean varieties. Traditional chemical analysis methods of soybean variety sampling (e.g., mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography) are destructive and time-consuming. In this paper, a robust and accurate method for nondestructive soybean classification is developed through hyperspectral imaging and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Image acquisition, preprocessing, and feature selection are used to obtain different types of soybean hyperspectral features. Based on these features, one of ensemble classifiers-random subspace linear discriminant (RSLD) algorithm is used to classify soybean seeds. Compared with the linear discrimination (LD) and linear support vector machine (LSVM) methods, the results show that the RSLD algorithm in this paper is more stable and reliable. In classifying soybeans in 10, 15, 20, and 25 categories, the RSLD method achieves the highest classification accuracy. When 155 features are used to classify 15 types of soybeans, the classification accuracy of the RSLD method reaches 99.2%, while the classification accuracies of the LD and LSVM methods are only 98.6% and 69.7%, respectively. Therefore, the ensemble classification algorithm RSLD can maintain high classification accuracy when different types and different classification features are used.",

    "abstract": "To develop and test an optimized radiomics model based on multi-planar automated breast volume scan (ABVS) images to identify malignant and benign breast lesions. Patients (n = 200) with breast lesions who underwent ABVS examinations were included. For each patient, 208 radiomics features were extracted from the ABVS images, including axial plane and coronal plane. Recursive feature elimination, random forest, and chi-square test were used to select features. A support vector machine, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting were utilized as classifiers to differentiate malignant and benign breast lesions. The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision was used to evaluate the performance of the radiomics models. Generalization of the radiomics models was verified through 5-fold cross-validation. For a single plane or a combination of planes, a combination of recursive feature elimination, and support vector machine yielded the best performance when identifying breast lesions. The machine learning models based on a combination of planes performed better than those based on a single plane. Regarding the axial plane and coronal plane, the machine learning model using a combination of recursive feature elimination and support vector machine yielded the optimal identification performance: average area under the curve (0.857 ± 0.058, 95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.957); the average values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision were 87.9, 68.2, 80.7, and 82.9%, respectively. The optimized radiomics model based on ABVS images can provide valuable information for identifying benign and malignant breast lesions preoperatively and guide the accurate clinical treatment. Further external validation is required.",

    "abstract": "Explainability in Medical Computer Vision is one of the most sensible implementations of Artificial Intelligence nowadays in healthcare. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning architecture for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, specially designed for medical diagnostic. The proposed approach leverages Variational Autoencoders properties to produce linear modifications of images in a lower-dimensional embedded space, and then reconstructs these modifications into non-linear explanations in the original image space. The proposed approach is based on global and local regularisation of the latent space, which stores visual and semantic information about images. Specifically, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is designed for searching explanations, finding individuals that can misclassify the classification output of the network while producing the minimum number of changes in the image descriptor. The genetic algorithm is able to search for explanations without defining any hyperparameters, and uses only one individual to provide a complete explanation of the whole image. Furthermore, the explanations found by the proposed approach are compared with state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence systems and the results show an improvement in the precision of the explanation between 56.39 and 7.23 percentage points.",

    "abstract": "The research aims to propose a feature selection model for hydraulic analysis as such a model has not been proposed previously. For this purpose, hybrids of three metaheuristic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and genetic algorithm (GA) with two machine learning models which are support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) are employed. The dataset considered was hydraulic having an association with flood and possessed topographic, geo-environmental, and human-induced variables. The dataset considered had multicollinearity heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation problems. The metaheuristic algorithms were evaluated by varying the number of population size. Among them, PSO performed better by providing an appropriate number of features with a lower number of iterations. We have analyzed the performance of SVM with different kernels; linear, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, and polynomial, as the original SVM is designed only for linear datasets but the hydraulic dataset possesses non-linear characteristics as well. The performance of different kernels in terms of their accuracies is evaluated and recorded. This study showed that RBF performed the best and sigmoid showed the least accuracy for GA, PSO, and ACO algorithms. The performance of KNN is evaluated in terms of accuracies by varying the K-values. It was found that KNN shows low accuracy with a small K-value which then attained a maximum level by increasing K-values, and it finally started decreasing, explicitly, by further enhancing K-values. While comparing the performance of hybrids of GA, PSO, and ACO with SVM and KNN, it was analyzed that KNN performed better with these meta-heuristics with PSO-KNN which performed the best among the baseline models. Thus, the study proposes that PSO-KNN can be utilized as a feature selection technique to obtain optimal data subsets for hydraulic modeling and analysis.",

    "title": "Cost-sensitive multi-label learning with positive and negative label pairwise correlations.",
    "abstract": "Multi-label learning is the problem where each instance is associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Binary Relevance (BR) is a representative algorithm for multi-label learning. However, it may suffer the class-imbalance issue especially when the label space is large. Besides, it ignores the label correlations, which is of importance to improve the performance. Moreover, labels might have positive and negative correlations in real applications, but existing methods seldom exploit the negative label correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel Cost-sensitive multi-label learning model with Positive and Negative Label pairwise correlations (CPNL), which extends BR to tackle the above issues. The kernel extension of the linear model is also provided to explore complex input-output relationships. Moreover, we adopt two accelerated gradient methods (AGM) to efficiently solve the linear and kernel models. Experimental results show that our approach CPNL achieves a competitive performance to some state-of-the-art approaches for multi-label learning.",

Several neural network-based machine learning techniques are developed for recognizing the gender and identity of a target. These algorithms were trained and validated using a dataset constructed from the information captured from 23 subjects while walking, alone, on the sensing floor. A deep neural network comprising a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) provided the most accurate identity performance, classifying individuals with an accuracy of 98.12% on the test data. On the other hand, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was the most accurate for gender recognition, attaining an accuracy of 93.3%. The neural network-based algorithms are benchmarked against Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a classifier used in many reported works for floor-based recognition tasks.

    "abstract": "The machine vision based methods for micro-cracks detection of solar cells surface have become one of the main research directions with its efficiency and convenience. The existed methods are roughly classified into two categories: current viewing information based methods, prior knowledge based methods, however, the former usually adopt hand-designed features with poor generality and lacks the guidance of prior knowledge, the latter are usually implemented through the machine learning, and the generalization ability is also limited since the large-scale annotation dataset is scarce. To resolve above problems, a novel micro-cracks detection method via combining short-term and long-term deep features is proposed in this paper. The short-term deep features which represent the current viewing information are learned from the input image itself through stacked denoising auto encoder (SDAE), the long-term deep features which represent the prior knowledge are learned from a large number of natural scene images that people often see through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the performance of combining the short-term and long-term deep features is better than any of them alone, 2) the performance of proposed method is superior to the shallow learning based methods, 3) the proposed method can effectively detect various kinds of micro-cracks.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of leveraging molecular properties, as determined by MD-LOVIs software and machine learning techniques, to predict the ability of compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Accurate prediction of BBB permeation is critical for the development of central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The study applies various machine learning models, including both classification and regression techniques, to predict BBB passage and molecular activity. Notably, classification models such as GBM-AWV (accuracy = 0.801), GLM-CN (accuracy = 0.808), SVMPoly-means (accuracy = 0.980), SVMPoly-AC (accuracy = 0.980), SVMPoly-MI_TI_SI (accuracy = 0.900), SVMPoly-GI (accuracy = 0.900), RF-means (accuracy = 0.870), and GLM-means (accuracy = 0.818) demonstrate high accuracy in predicting BBB passage. In contrast, regression models like ES-RLM-AG (R = 0.902), IB-IBK (R = 0.82), IB-Kstar (R = 0.834), IB-MLP (R = 0.843), and DRF-AWV (R = 0.810) exhibit strong performance in predicting molecular activity. The results show that classification models like GBM-AWV, GLM-CN, and SVMPoly variants, as well as regression models like ES-RLM-AG and IB-MLP, achieve high performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting BBB permeability. The computational methods employed in this study include the MD-LOVIs software for generating molecular descriptors and several machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machines (GBM), generalized linear models (GLM), support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial kernels, random forests (RF), ensemble regression models, and instance-based learning algorithms.

    "title": "Parameter importance assessment improves efficacy of machine learning methods for predicting snow avalanche sites in Leh-Manali Highway, India.",
    "abstract": "Due to ongoing climate change, water mass redistribution and related hazards are getting stronger and frequent. Therefore, predicting extreme hydrological events and related hazards is one of the highest priorities in geosciences. Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown promising prospects in this venture. Every ML method requires training where we know both the output (extreme event) and input (relevant physical parameters and variables). This step is critical to the efficacy of the ML method. The usual approach is to include a wide variety of hydro-meteorological observations and physical parameters, but recent advances in ML indicate that the efficacy of ML may not improve by increasing the number of input parameters. In fact, including unimportant parameters decreases the efficacy of ML algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative that the most relevant parameters are identified prior to training. In this study, we demonstrate this concept by predicting avalanche susceptibility in Leh-Manali highway (one of the most severely affected regions in India) with and without Parameter Importance Assessment (PIA). The avalanche locations were randomly divided into two groups: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Then, based on temporal and spatial sensor data, eleven avalanche influencing parameters were considered. The Boruta algorithm, an extension of Random Forest (RF) ML method that utilizes the importance measure to rank predictors, was used and it found nine out of eleven parameters to be important. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based ML technique is used for avalanche prediction, and to be comprehensive, four different kernel functions were employed (linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis function (RBF)). The prediction accuracy for linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and RBF kernels, with all the eleven parameters were found to be 80.4%, 81.7%, 39.2%, and 85.7%, respectively. While, when using selected parameters, the prediction accuracy for linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and RBF kernels were 84.1%, 86.6%, 43.0%, and 87.8%, respectively. We also identified locations where occurrences of avalanches are most likely. We conclude that parameter selection should be considered when applying ML methods in geosciences.",

    "abstract": "Using embedded sensors, instrumented walkways provide clinicians with important information regarding gait disturbances. However, because raw data are summarized into standard gait variables, there may be some salient features and patterns that are ignored. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease which predominantly impacts young to middle-aged adults. People with MS may experience varying degrees of gait impairments, making it a reasonable model to test contemporary machine leaning algorithms. In this study, we employ machine learning techniques applied to raw walkway data to discern MS patients from healthy controls. We achieve this goal by constructing a range of new features which supplement standard parameters to improve machine learning model performance. Eleven variables from the standard gait feature set achieved the highest accuracy of 81%, precision of 95%, recall of 81%, and F1-score of 87%, using support vector machine (SVM). The inclusion of the novel features (toe direction, hull area, base of support area, foot length, foot width and foot area) increased classification accuracy by 7%, recall by 9%, and F1-score by 6%. The use of an instrumented walkway can generate rich data that is generally unseen by clinicians and researchers. Machine learning applied to standard gait variables can discern MS patients from healthy controls with excellent accuracy. Noteworthy, classifications are made stronger by including novel gait features (toe direction, hull area, base of support area, foot length and foot area).",

In order to realize rapid non-destructive testing of hotpot oil quality, a modeling experiment method of fluorescence hyperspectral technology combined with machine learning algorithm was proposed. Five preprocessing algorithms were used to preprocess the original spectral data, which realized data denoising and reduces the influence of baseline drift and tilt. The feature bands extracted from the spectral data showed that the best feature bands for the two-classification model and the six-classification model were concentrated between 469 and 962 nm and 534-809 nm, respectively. Using the PCA algorithm to visualize the spectral data, the results showed the distribution of the six types of samples intuitively, and indicated that the data could be classified. Based on the modeling analysis of the feature bands, the results showed that the best two-classification models and the best six-classification models were MF-RF-RF and MF-XGBoost-LGB models, respectively, and the classification accuracy reached 100 %. Compared with the traditional model, the error was greatly reduced, and the calculation time was also saved.

    "title": "A New Statistical Features Based Approach for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Vibration Signals.",
    "abstract": "In condition based maintenance, different signal processing techniques are used to sense the faults through the vibration and acoustic emission signals, received from the machinery. These signal processing approaches mostly utilise time, frequency, and time-frequency domain analysis. The features obtained are later integrated with the different machine learning techniques to classify the faults into different categories. In this work, different statistical features of vibration signals in time and frequency domains are studied for the detection and localisation of faults in the roller bearings. These are later classified into healthy, outer race fault, inner race fault, and ball fault classes. The statistical features including skewness, kurtosis, average and root mean square values of time domain vibration signals are considered. These features are extracted from the second derivative of the time domain vibration signals and power spectral density of vibration signals. The vibration signal is also converted to the frequency domain and the same features are extracted. All three feature sets are concatenated, creating the time, frequency and spectral power domain feature vectors. These feature vectors are finally fed into the K- nearest neighbour, support vector machine and kernel linear discriminant analysis for the detection and classification of bearing faults. With the proposed method, the reduction percentage of more than 95% percent is achieved, which not only reduces the computational burden but also the classification time. Simulation results show that the signals are classified to achieve an average accuracy of 99.13% using KLDA and 96.64% using KNN classifiers. The results are also compared with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) features and Fourier transform features without extracting any statistical information, which are two of the most widely used approaches in the literature. To gain a certain level of confidence in the classification results, a detailed statistical analysis is also provided.",

    "title": "Detection of brain tumors using a transfer learning-based optimized ResNet152 model in MR images.",
    "abstract": "Brain tumors are incredibly harmful and can drastically reduce life expectancy. Most researchers use magnetic resonance (MR) scans to detect tumors because they can provide detailed images of the affected area. Recently, AI-based deep learning methods have emerged to enhance diagnostic accuracy through efficient data processing. This study investigates the effectiveness of deep transfer learning techniques for accurate brain tumor diagnosis. A preprocessing pipeline is used to enhance the image quality. This pipeline includes morphological operations such as erosion and dilation for shape refinement, Gaussian blurring for noise reduction, and thresholding for image cropping. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for dimensionality reduction, and data augmentation enriches the dataset. The dataset is partitioned into training (80 %) and testing (20 %). Pretrained ResNet152 and GoogleNet extract meaningful features from the images. These extracted features are then classified using conventional machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). This study compares the performance of two pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, recall, and F1-Score evaluate the final classification results. ResNet152 outperforms GoogleNet, achieving a 98.53 % accuracy, an F1 score of 97.4 %, and a sensitivity of 96.52 %. This study highlights integrating deep learning and traditional machine-learning techniques in medical image analysis for effective brain tumor detection.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a framework for the prediction of thermophysical properties based on transfer learning from existing estimation models is explored. The predictive capabilities of conventional group-contribution methods and traditional machine-learning approaches rely heavily on the availability of experimental datasets and their uncertainty. Through the use of a pretraining scheme, which leverages the knowledge established by other estimation methods, improved prediction models for thermophysical properties can be obtained after fine-tuning networks with more accurate experimental data. As our experiments show, for the case of critical properties of compounds, this pipeline not only improves the performance of the models on commonly found organic structures but can also help these models generalize to less explored areas of chemical space, where experimental data is scarce, such as inorganics and heavier organic compounds. Transfer learning from estimation models data also allows for graph-based deep learning models to create more flexible molecular features over a bigger chemical space, which leads to improved predictive capabilities and can give insights into the relationship between molecular structures and thermophysical properties. The generated molecular features can discriminate behavior discrepancy between isomers without the need of additional parameters. Also, this approach shows better robustness to outliers in experimental datasets.",

    "title": "Machine learning - Predicting Ames mutagenicity of small molecules.",
    "abstract": "In modern drug discovery, detection of a compound's potential mutagenicity is crucial. However, the traditional method of mutagenicity detection using the Ames test is costly and time consuming as the compounds need to be synthesised and then tested and the results are not always accurate and reproducible. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop robust in silico models which can accurately predict the mutagenicity of a compound prior to synthesis to overcome the inadequacies of the Ames test. After curation of a previously defined compound mutagenicity library, over 5000 molecules had their chemical fingerprints and molecular properties calculated. Using 8 classification modelling algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), a total of 112 predictive models have been constructed. Their performance has been assessed using 10-fold cross validation and a hold-out test set and some of the top performing models have been assessed using the y-randomisation approach. As a result, we have found SVM and XGB models to have good performance during the 10-fold cross validation (AUROC >0.90, sensitivity >0.85, specificity >0.75, balanced accuracy >0.80, Kappa >0.65) and on the test set (AUROC >0.65, sensitivity >0.65, specificity >0.60, balanced accuracy >0.65, Kappa >0.30). We have also identified molecular properties that are the most influential for mutagenicity prediction when combined with chemical molecular fingerprints. Using the Class A mutagenic compounds from the Ames/QSAR International Challenge Project, we were able to verify our models perform better, predicting more mutagens correctly then the StarDrop Ames mutagenicity prediction and TEST mutagenicity prediction.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we classify the stress state of car drivers using multimodal physiological signals and regularized deep kernel learning. Using a driving simulator in a controlled environment, we acquire electrocardiography (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), and respiration rate (RESP) from N = 10 healthy drivers in experiments of 25min duration with different stress states (5min resting, 10min driving, 10min driving + answering cognitive questions). We manually remove unusable segments and approximately 4h of data remain. Multimodal time and frequency features are extracted and employed to regularized deep kernel machine learning based on a fusion framework. Task-specific representations of different physiological signals are combined using intermediate fusion. Subsequently, the fused multimodal features are fed a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) for stress classification. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can discriminate between stress states. The combination of PPG and ECG using RF as classifier yields the highest F1-score of 0.97 in the test set. PPG only and RF yield a maximum F1-score of 0.90. Furthermore, subject-specific cross-validation improves performance. ECG and PPG signals are reliable in classifying the stress state of a car driver. In summary, the proposed framework could be extended to real-time stress state assessment in driving conditions.",

    "title": "A comprehensive framework for advanced protein classification and function prediction using synergistic approaches: Integrating bispectral analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.",
    "abstract": "Proteins are fundamental components of diverse cellular systems and play crucial roles in a variety of disease processes. Consequently, it is crucial to comprehend their structure, function, and intricate interconnections. Classifying proteins into families or groups with comparable structural and functional characteristics is a crucial aspect of this comprehension. This classification is crucial for evolutionary research, predicting protein function, and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Sequence alignment and structure-based alignment are frequently ineffective techniques for identifying protein families.This study addresses the need for a more efficient and accurate technique for feature extraction and protein classification. The research proposes a novel method that integrates bispectrum characteristics, deep learning techniques, and machine learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. The proposed method uses numbers to represent protein sequences, utilizes bispectrum analysis, uses different topologies for convolutional neural networks to pull out features, and chooses robust features to classify protein families. The goal is to outperform existing methods for identifying protein families, thereby enhancing classification metrics. The materials consist of numerous protein datasets, whereas the methods incorporate bispectrum characteristics and deep learning strategies. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed method for identifying protein families is superior to conventional approaches. Significantly enhanced quality metrics demonstrated the efficacy of the combined bispectrum and deep learning approaches. These findings have the potential to advance the field of protein biology and facilitate pharmaceutical innovation. In conclusion, this study presents a novel method that employs bispectrum characteristics and deep learning techniques to improve the precision and efficiency of protein family identification. The demonstrated advancements in classification metrics demonstrate this method's applicability to numerous scientific disciplines. This furthers our understanding of protein function and its implications for disease and treatment.",

    "title": "Harnessing machine learning models for non-invasive pre-diabetes screening in children and adolescents.",
    "abstract": "Pre-diabetes has been identified as an intermediate diagnosis and a sign of a relatively high chance of developing diabetes in the future. Diabetes has become one of the most frequent chronic disorders in children and adolescents around the world; therefore, predicting the onset of pre-diabetes allows a person at risk to make efforts to avoid or restrict disease progression. This research aims to create and implement a cross-validated machine learning model that can predict pre-diabetes using non-invasive methods. We have analysed the national representative dataset of children and adolescents (5-19 years) to develop a machine learning model for non-invasive pre-diabetes screening. Based on HbA1c levels the data (n = 26,567) was segregated into normal (n = 23,777) and pre-diabetes (n = 2790). We have considered eight features, six hyper-tuned machine learning models and different metrics for model evaluation. The final model was selected based on the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), Cohen's kappa and cross-validation score. The selected model was integrated into the screening tool for automated pre-diabetes prediction. The XG boost classifier was the best model, including all eight features. The 10-fold cross-validation score was highest for the XG boost model (90.13%) and least for the support vector machine (61.17%). The AUC was highest for RF (0.970), followed by GB (0.968), XGB (0.959), ETC (0.918), DT (0.908), and SVM (0.574) models. The XGB model was used to develop the screening tool. We have developed and deployed a machine learning model for automated real-time pre-diabetes screening. The screening tool can be used over computers and can be transformed into software for easy usage. The detection of pre-diabetes in the pediatric age may help avoid its enhancement. Machine learning can also show great competence in determining important features in pre-diabetes.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Machine Learning-Based Image Recognition of Raw Infrared Spectra: Toward Chemist-like Chemical Structural Classification and Beyond Numerical Data.",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly improved spectral data analysis. In this study, we used unsupervised machine learning to classify chemical compounds based on infrared (IR) spectral images, without relying on prior chemical knowledge. The potential of machine learning for chemical classification was demonstrated by extracting IR spectral images from the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds and converting them into 208,620-dimensional vector data. Hierarchical clustering of 230 compounds revealed distinct main clusters ( - ), each with specific subclusters exhibiting higher intracluster similarities. Despite the challenges, including sensitivity to spectral deviations and difficulty of distinguishing delicate chemical structures in spectra with low transparency in the fingerprint area, the proposed image recognition approach exhibits good potential. Both principal component analysis and k-means clustering produced similar results. Furthermore, the method demonstrated high robustness to noise. The Tanimoto coefficient was used to evaluate the molecular similarity, providing valuable insights. However, some results deviated from chemists' intuitions. The study also highlighted that the scaling composition formulas and molecular weights did not affect the classification results because high-dimensional features dominated the process. A comparison of the clustering results obtained from molecular fingerprints, using the adjusted Rand index as a metric, indicated that the image data provided better classification performance than numerical data of the same resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning with IR spectral image data for chemical classification and offers a novel perspective that complements traditional methods, although the classifications may not always align with chemists' intuitions. This approach has broader implications for fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and automated spectral analysis, where handling large, raw spectral data sets is essential.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting future carbon emissions is of great significance for the government to scientifically promote carbon emission reduction policies. Among the current technologies for forecasting carbon emissions, the most prominent ones are econometric models and deep learning, but few works have systematically compared and analyzed the forecasting performance of the methods. Therefore, the paper makes a comparison for deep learning model, machine learning model, and the econometric model to demonstrate whether deep learning is an efficient method for carbon emission prediction research. In model mechanism, neural network for deep learning refers to an information processing model established by simulating biological neural system, and the model can be further extended through bionic characteristics. So the paper further optimizes the model from the perspective of bionics and proposes an innovative deep learning model based on the memory behavior mechanism of group creatures. Comparison results show that the prediction accuracy of the heuristic neural network is higher than that of the econometric model. Through in-depth analysis, the heuristic neural network is more suitable for predicting future carbon emissions, while the econometric model is more suitable for clarifying the impact of influencing factors on carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "Characterization and development of hydrocarbon reservoirs depends on the classification of lithological patterns from well log data. In thin reservoir units, limited vertical data impedes the efficient classification of lithologies. We present a test case of petrofacies classification using machine learning models in a thin interval of finely laminated limestones using pseudo-well data created over outcrops (radiometric and unconfined compressive strength logs). We tested Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques to classify eight petrofacies types, divided into two groups. The objective was to observe the capacity of some well-known models to classify petrofacies with a high-frequency vertical variation of diagenetic heterogeneities in an extreme scenario within a thin sedimentary interval. The GNB was less effective (F 1 score of 0.29), and the SVM achieved the best results in classifying the main facies patterns (F 1 = 0.47). However, the GNB performed better when the analysis was focused on distinguishing the two main groups of petrofacies. The results demonstrate that high-frequency facies variations present a challenge to the automatic identification of lithofacies, mainly due to local variations in horizontal heterogeneities (on the mm- to cm-scale) created by depositional and diagenetic processes, which impact the flow in porous media.",

CVRDNNs have a higher processing capability and can perform better than multilayered real-valued RDNNs. Firstly, a general IT2 T-S fuzzy neural network model is constructed by considering complex-valued parameters and the reaction-diffusion terms. Secondly, a mini-batch semi-stochastic machine learning technique is proposed to optimize the maximum sampling period in an FMSETM. Furthermore, by constructing an asymmetric Lyapunov functional (LF) dependent on the membership function (MF), certain symmetric and positive-definite constraints of matrices are removed. The synchronization criteria are derived via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the IT2 T-S fuzzy CVRDNNs. Finally, two numerical examples are utilized to corroborate the feasibility of the developed approach. From the simulation results, it can be seen that introducing machine learning techniques into the synchronization problem of CVRDNNs can improve the efficiency of convergence.",

    "abstract": "Direct observation of morphological plant traits is tedious and a bottleneck for high-throughput phenotyping. Hence, interest in image-based analysis is increasing, with the requirement for software that can reliably extract plant traits, such as leaf count, preferably across a variety of species and growth conditions. However, current leaf counting methods do not work across species or conditions and therefore may lack broad utility. In this paper, we present Pheno-Deep Counter, a single deep network that can predict leaf count in two-dimensional (2D) plant images of different species with a rosette-shaped appearance. We demonstrate that our architecture can count leaves from multi-modal 2D images, such as visible light, fluorescence and near-infrared. Our network design is flexible, allowing for inputs to be added or removed to accommodate new modalities. Furthermore, our architecture can be used as is without requiring dataset-specific customization of the internal structure of the network, opening its use to new scenarios. Pheno-Deep Counter is able to produce accurate predictions in many plant species and, once trained, can count leaves in a few seconds. Through our universal and open source approach to deep counting we aim to broaden utilization of machine learning-based approaches to leaf counting.

    "title": "CM-LSTM Based Spectrum Sensing.",
    "abstract": "This paper presents spectrum sensing as a classification problem, and uses a spectrum-sensing algorithm based on a signal covariance matrix and long short-term memory network (CM-LSTM). We jointly exploited the spatial cross-correlation of multiple signals received by the antenna array and the temporal autocorrelation of single signals; we used the long short-term memory network (LSTM), which is good at extracting temporal correlation features, as the classification model; we then input the covariance matrix of the signals received by the array into the LSTM classification model to achieve the fusion learning of spatial correlation features and temporal correlation features of the signals, thus significantly improving the performance of spectrum sensing. Simulation analysis shows that the CM-LSTM-based spectrum-sensing algorithm shows better performance compared with support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and energy detection (ED) algorithm-based spectrum-sensing algorithms for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and different numbers of secondary users (SUs). Among them, SVM is a classical machine-learning algorithm, GBM and RF are two integrated learning methods with better generalization capability, and ED is a classical, traditional, and spectrum-sensing algorithm.",

    "title": "Prediction of dementia based on older adults' sleep disturbances using machine learning.",
    "abstract": "The most common degenerative condition in older adults is dementia, which can be predicted using a number of indicators and whose progression can be slowed down. One of the indicators of an increased risk of dementia is sleep disturbances. This study aims to examine if machine learning can predict dementia and which sleep disturbance factors impact dementia. This study uses five machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting, logistic regression, gaussian naive Bayes, random forest and support vector machine) and data on the older population (60+) in Sweden from the Swedish National Study on Ageing and Care - Blekinge (n=4175). Each algorithm uses 10-fold stratified cross-validation to obtain the results, which consist of the Brier score for checking accuracy and the feature importance for examining the factors which impact dementia. The algorithms use 16 features which are on personal and sleep disturbance factors. Logistic regression found an association between dementia and sleep disturbances. However, it is slight for the features in the study. Gradient boosting was the most accurate algorithm with 92.9% accuracy, 0.926 f1-score, 0.974 ROC AUC and 0.056 Brier score. The significant factors were different in each machine learning algorithm. If the person sleeps more than two hours during the day, their sex, education level, age, waking up during the night and if the person snores are the variables that most consistently have the highest feature importance in all algorithms. There is an association between sleep disturbances and dementia, which machine learning algorithms can predict. Furthermore, the risk factors for dementia are different across the algorithms, but sleep disturbances can predict dementia.",

    "title": "AI-driven approaches for air pollution modelling: A comprehensive systematic review.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, air quality levels have become a global issue with the rise of harmful pollutants and their effects on climate change. Urban areas are especially affected by air pollution, resulting in a deterioration of the environment and a surge in health complications. Research has been conducted on different studies that accurately predict future pollution concentration levels utilising different methods. This paper introduces the current physical models for air quality prediction and conducts an extensive systematic literature review on Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for predicting pollutants. This work compares different methodologies and techniques by grouping studies that utilise similar approaches together and comparing them. Furthermore, a distinction is made between temporal and spatiotemporal models to understand and highlight how both approaches impact future air pollutant concentration level predictions. The review differs from similar works as it focuses not only on comparing models and approaches but by analysing how the usage of external features, such as meteorological data, traffic information, and land usage, affect pollutant levels and the model's accuracy on air quality forecasting. Performances and limitations are explored for both Machine and Deep Learning approaches, and the work offers a discussion on their comparison and possible future developments in this research space. This review highlights how Deep Learning models tend to be more suitable for forecasting problems due to their feature and spatio-temporal correlation representation abilities, as well as providing different directions for further work, from models utilisation to feature inclusion.",

    "title": "A new method for identification of traditional Chinese medicine constitution based on tongue features with machine learning.",
    "abstract": "The theory of Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution contributes to the optimisation of individualised healthcare programmes. However, at present, TCM constitution identification mainly relies on inefficient questionnaires with subjective bias. Efficient and accurate TCM constitution identification can play an important role in individualised medicine and healthcare. Building an efficient model for identifying traditional Chinese medicine constitutions using objective tongue features and machine learning techniques. The DS01-A device was applied to collect tongue images and extract features. We trained and evaluated five machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), LightGBM (LGBM), and CatBoost (CB). Among these, we selected the model with the best performance as the base classifier for constructing our heterogeneous ensemble learning model. Using various performance metrics, including classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC), to comprehensively evaluate model performance. A total of 1149 tongue images were obtained and 45 features were extracted, forming dataset 1. RF, LGBM, and CB were selected as the base learners for the RLC-Stacking. On dataset 1, RLC-Stacking1 achieved an accuracy of 0.8122, outperforming individual classifiers. After feature selection, the classification accuracy of RLC-Stacking2 improved to 0.8287, an improvement of 0.00165 compared to RLC-Stacking1. RLC-Stacking2 achieved an accuracy exceeding 0.85 for identifying each TCM constitution type, indicating excellent identification performance. The study provides a reliable method for the accurate and rapid identification of TCM constitutions and can assist clinicians in tailoring individualized medical treatments based on personal constitution types and guide daily health care. The information extracted from tongue images serves as an effective marker for objective TCM constitution identification.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning demonstrates greater competence over traditional machine learning techniques for many tasks. In last several years, deep learning has been applied to protein function prediction and a series of good achievements has been obtained. These findings extensively advanced our understanding of protein function. However, the accuracy of protein function prediction based upon deep learning still has yet to be improved. In article number 1900019, Issue 12, Zhang et al. construct DeepFunc, a deep learning framework using derived feature information of protein sequence and protein interactions network. They find that implementing DeepFunc for protein function prediction is more accurate than using DeepGO, a similar method reported previously. Meanwhile, they find that the method of combining multiple derived feature information in DeepFunc is much better than the method of using only single derived feature information. Due to its fully exploiting feature representation learning ability, deep learning with more derived feature information will enable it to be a promising method for solving more complicated protein function prediction problems and other bioinformatics challenges. Recent researches have provided some major insights into the value for using deep learning to protein function prediction problem.",

    "abstract": "To assess a radiomic machine learning (ML) model in classifying solid adrenal lesions (ALs) without fat signal drop on chemical shift (CS) as benign or malignant. 55 indeterminate ALs (21 lipid poor adenomas, 15 benign pheocromocytomas, 1 oncocytoma, 12 metastases, 6 primary tumors) showing no fat signal drop on CS were retrospectively included. Manual 3D segmentation on T2-weighted and CS images was performed for subsequent radiomic feature extraction. After feature stability testing and an 80-20% train-test split, the train set was balanced via oversampling. Following a multi-step feature selection, an Extra Trees model was tuned with 5-fold stratified cross-validation in the train set and then tested on the hold-out test set. A total of 3396 features were extracted from each AL, of which 133 resulted unstable while none had low variance (< 0.01). Highly correlated (r > 0.8) features were also excluded, leaving 440 parameters. Among these, Support Vector Machine 5-fold stratified cross-validated recursive feature elimination selected a subset of 6 features. ML obtained a cross-validation accuracy of 0.94 on the train and 0.91 on the test sets. Precision, recall and F1 score were respectively 0.92, 0.91 and 0.91.

    "abstract": "The scarcity of water for agricultural use is a serious problem that has increased due to intense droughts, poor management, and deficiencies in the distribution and application of the resource. The monitoring of crops through satellite image processing and the application of machine learning algorithms are technological strategies with which developed countries tend to implement better public policies regarding the efficient use of water. The purpose of this research was to determine the main indicators and characteristics that allow us to discriminate the phenological stages of maize crops ( L.) in Sentinel 2 satellite images through supervised classification models. The training data were obtained by monitoring cultivated plots during an agricultural cycle. Indicators and characteristics were extracted from 41 Sentinel 2 images acquired during the monitoring dates. With these images, indicators of texture, vegetation, and colour were calculated to train three supervised classifiers: linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) models. It was found that 45 of the 86 characteristics extracted contributed to maximizing the accuracy by stage of development and the overall accuracy of the trained classification models. The characteristics of the Moran's local indicator of spatial association (LISA) improved the accuracy of the classifiers when applied to the L*a*b* colour model and to the near-infrared (NIR) band. The local binary pattern (LBP) increased the accuracy of the classification when applied to the red, green, blue (RGB) and NIR bands. The colour ratios, leaf area index (LAI), RGB colour model, L*a*b* colour space, LISA, and LBP extracted the most important intrinsic characteristics of maize crops with regard to classifying the phenological stages of the maize cultivation. The quadratic SVM model was the best classifier of maize crop phenology, with an overall accuracy of 82.3%.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a revolutionary innovation in machine learning that enables the generation of artificial data. Artificial data synthesis is valuable especially in the medical field where it is difficult to collect and annotate real data due to privacy issues, limited access to experts, and cost. While adversarial training has led to significant breakthroughs in the computer vision field, biomedical research has not yet fully exploited the capabilities of generative models for data generation, and for more complex tasks such as biosignal modality transfer. We present a broad analysis on adversarial learning on biosignal data. Our study is the first in the machine learning community to focus on synthesizing 1D biosignal data using adversarial models. We consider three types of deep generative adversarial networks: a classical GAN, an adversarial AE, and a modality transfer GAN; individually designed for biosignal synthesis and modality transfer purposes. We evaluate these methods on multiple datasets for different biosignal modalites, including phonocardiogram (PCG), electrocardiogram (ECG), vectorcardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram. We follow subject-independent evaluation protocols, by evaluating the proposed models' performance on completely unseen data to demonstrate generalizability. We achieve superior results in generating biosignals, specifically in conditional generation, by synthesizing realistic samples while preserving domain-relevant characteristics. We also demonstrate insightful results in biosignal modality transfer that can generate expanded representations from fewer input-leads, ultimately making the clinical monitoring setting more convenient for the patient. Furthermore our longer duration ECGs generated, maintain clear ECG rhythmic regions, which has been proven using ad-hoc segmentation models.",

Owing to the nature of developed Zero-Day malware, distinct evasion tactics are used to remain stealth. Hence, there is a need for advance investigations of the methods that can identify such kind of malware. Machine learning (ML) is among the promising techniques for such type of predictions, while the sandbox provides a safe environment for such experiments. After thorough literature review, carefully chosen ML techniques are proposed for the malware detection, under Cuckoo sandboxing (CS) environment. The proposed system is coined as Zero-Day Vigilante (ZeVigilante) to detect the malware considering both static and dynamic analyses. We used adequate datasets for both analyses incorporating sufficient samples in contrast to other studies. Consequently, the processed datasets are used to train and test several ML classiﬁers including Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

    "title": "Identifying multi-functional bioactive peptide functions using multi-label deep learning.",
    "abstract": "The bioactive peptide has wide functions, such as lowering blood glucose levels and reducing inflammation. Meanwhile, computational methods such as machine learning are becoming more and more important for peptide functions prediction. Most of the previous studies concentrate on the single-functional bioactive peptides prediction. However, the number of multi-functional peptides is on the increase; therefore, novel computational methods are needed. In this study, we develop a method MLBP (Multi-Label deep learning approach for determining the multi-functionalities of Bioactive Peptides), which can predict multiple functions including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial simultaneously. MLBP model takes the peptide sequence vector as input to replace the biological and physiochemical features used in other peptides predictors. Using the embedding layer, the dense continuous feature vector is learnt from the sequence vector. Then, we extract convolution features from the feature vector through the convolutional neural network layer and combine with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit layer to improve the prediction performance. The 5-fold cross-validation experiments are conducted on the training dataset, and the results show that Accuracy and Absolute true are 0.695 and 0.685, respectively. On the test dataset, Accuracy and Absolute true of MLBP are 0.709 and 0.697, with 5.0 and 4.7% higher than those of the suboptimum method, respectively. The results indicate MLBP has superior prediction performance on the multi-functional peptides identification.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning frameworks have rapidly become the main methodology for analyzing medical images. Due to their powerful learning ability and advantages in dealing with complex patterns, deep learning algorithms are ideal for image analysis challenges, particularly in the field of digital pathology. The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of deep learning includes classification (e.g., healthy vs. cancerous tissue), detection (e.g., lymphocytes and mitosis counting), and segmentation (e.g., nuclei and glands segmentation). The majority of recent machine learning methods in digital pathology have a pre- and/or post-processing stage which is integrated with a deep neural network. These stages, based on traditional image processing methods, are employed to make the subsequent classification, detection, or segmentation problem easier to solve. Several studies have shown how the integration of pre- and post-processing methods within a deep learning pipeline can further increase the model's performance when compared to the network by itself. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the types of methods that are used within deep learning frameworks either to optimally prepare the input (pre-processing) or to improve the results of the network output (post-processing), focusing on digital pathology image analysis. Many of the techniques presented here, especially the post-processing methods, are not limited to digital pathology but can be extended to almost any image analysis field.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically based on supervised learning, which requires large number of ground-truth labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time. Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher (or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation learning techniques.",

    "title": "A machine learning-based clinical tool for diagnosing myopathy using multi-cohort microarray expression profiles.",
    "abstract": "Myopathies are a heterogenous collection of disorders characterized by dysfunction of skeletal muscle. In practice, myopathies are frequently encountered by physicians and precise diagnosis remains a challenge in primary care. Molecular expression profiles show promise for disease diagnosis in various pathologies. We propose a novel machine learning-based clinical tool for predicting muscle disease subtypes using multi-cohort microarray expression data. Muscle tissue samples originating from 1260 patients with muscle weakness. Data was curated from 42 independent cohorts with expression profiles in public microarray gene expression repositories, which represent a broad range of patient ages and peripheral muscles. Cohorts were categorized into five muscle disease subtypes: immobility, inflammatory myopathies, intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW), congenital, and chronic systemic disease. The data contains expression data on 34,099 genes. Data augmentation techniques were used to address class imbalances in the muscle disease subtypes. Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained on two-thirds of the 1260 samples based on the top selected gene signature using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The model was validated in the remaining samples using area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). Gene enrichment analysis was used to identify enriched biological functions in the gene signature. The AUC ranges from 0.611 to 0.649 in the observed imbalanced data. Overall, using the augmented data, chronic systemic disease was the best predicted class with AUC 0.872 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.824-0.920). The least discriminated classes were ICUAW with AUC 0.777 (95% CI: 0.668-0.887) and immobility with AUC 0.789 (95% CI: 0.716-0.861). Disease-specific gene set enrichment results showed that the gene signature was enriched in biological processes including neural precursor cell proliferation for ICUAW and aerobic respiration for congenital (false discovery rate q-value < 0.001). Our results present a well-performing molecular classification tool with the selected gene markers for muscle disease classification. In practice, this tool addresses an important gap in the literature on myopathies and presents a potentially useful clinical tool for muscle disease subtype diagnosis.",

    "title": "Predicting Emerging Themes in Rapidly Expanding COVID-19 Literature With Unsupervised Word Embeddings and Machine Learning: Evidence-Based Study.",
    "abstract": "Evidence from peer-reviewed literature is the cornerstone for designing responses to global threats such as COVID-19. In massive and rapidly growing corpuses, such as COVID-19 publications, assimilating and synthesizing information is challenging. Leveraging a robust computational pipeline that evaluates multiple aspects, such as network topological features, communities, and their temporal trends, can make this process more efficient. We aimed to show that new knowledge can be captured and tracked using the temporal change in the underlying unsupervised word embeddings of the literature. Further imminent themes can be predicted using machine learning on the evolving associations between words. Frequently occurring medical entities were extracted from the abstracts of more than 150,000 COVID-19 articles published on the World Health Organization database, collected on a monthly interval starting from February 2020. Word embeddings trained on each month's literature were used to construct networks of entities with cosine similarities as edge weights. Topological features of the subsequent month's network were forecasted based on prior patterns, and new links were predicted using supervised machine learning. Community detection and alluvial diagrams were used to track biomedical themes that evolved over the months. We found that thromboembolic complications were detected as an emerging theme as early as August 2020. A shift toward the symptoms of long COVID complications was observed during March 2021, and neurological complications gained significance in June 2021. A prospective validation of the link prediction models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87. Predictive modeling revealed predisposing conditions, symptoms, cross-infection, and neurological complications as dominant research themes in COVID-19 publications based on the patterns observed in previous months. Machine learning-based prediction of emerging links can contribute toward steering research by capturing themes represented by groups of medical entities, based on patterns of semantic relationships over time.",

    "abstract": "Class imbalance problem (CIP) in a dataset is a major challenge that significantly affects the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models resulting in biased predictions. Numerous techniques have been proposed to address CIP, including, but not limited to, Oversampling, Undersampling, and cost-sensitive approaches. Due to its ability to generate synthetic data, oversampling techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) are the most widely used methodology by researchers. However, one of SMOTE's potential disadvantages is that newly created minor samples overlap with major samples. Therefore, the probability of ML models' biased performance toward major classes increases. Generative adversarial network (GAN) has recently garnered much attention due to their ability to create real samples. However, GAN is hard to train even though it has much potential. Considering these opportunities, this work proposes two novel techniques: GAN-based Oversampling (GBO) and Support Vector Machine-SMOTE-GAN (SSG) to overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. The preliminary results show that SSG and GBO performed better on the nine imbalanced benchmark datasets than several existing SMOTE-based approaches. Additionally, it can be observed that the proposed SSG and GBO methods can accurately classify the minor class with more than 90% accuracy when tested with 20%, 30%, and 40% of the test data. The study also revealed that the minor sample generated by SSG demonstrates Gaussian distributions, which is often difficult to achieve using original SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE.",

    "abstract": "The uptake transporter OATP1B1 (SLC01B1) is largely localized to the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes and is a known victim of unwanted drug-drug interactions. Computational models are useful for identifying potential substrates and/or inhibitors of clinically relevant transporters. Our goal was to generate OATP1B1 in vitro inhibition data for [ H] estrone-3-sulfate (E3S) transport in CHO cells and use it to build machine learning models to facilitate a comparison of seven different classification models (Deep learning, Adaboosted decision trees, Bernoulli naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbors (knn), random forest, support vector classifier (SVC), logistic regression (lreg), and XGBoost (xgb)] using ECFP6 fingerprints to perform 5-fold, nested cross validation. In addition, we compared models using 3D pharmacophores, simple chemical descriptors alone or plus ECFP6, as well as ECFP4 and ECFP8 fingerprints. Several machine learning algorithms (SVC, lreg, xgb, and knn) had excellent nested cross validation statistics, particularly for accuracy, AUC, and specificity. An external test set containing 207 unique compounds not in the training set demonstrated that at every threshold SVC outperformed the other algorithms based on a rank normalized score. A prospective validation test set was chosen using prediction scores from the SVC models with ECFP fingerprints and were tested in vitro with 15 of 19 compounds (84% accuracy) predicted as active (≥20% inhibition) showed inhibition. Of these compounds, six (abamectin, asiaticoside, berbamine, doramectin, mobocertinib, and umbralisib) appear to be novel inhibitors of OATP1B1 not previously reported. These validated machine learning models can now be used to make predictions for drug-drug interactions for human OATP1B1 alongside other machine learning models for important drug transporters in our MegaTrans software.",

    "title": "Applying Multivariate Segmentation Methods to Human Activity Recognition From Wearable Sensors' Data.",
    "abstract": "Time-resolved quantification of physical activity can contribute to both personalized medicine and epidemiological research studies, for example, managing and identifying triggers of asthma exacerbations. A growing number of reportedly accurate machine learning algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed using data from wearable devices (eg, smartwatch and smartphone). However, many HAR algorithms depend on fixed-size sampling windows that may poorly adapt to real-world conditions in which activity bouts are of unequal duration. A small sliding window can produce noisy predictions under stable conditions, whereas a large sliding window may miss brief bursts of intense activity. We aimed to create an HAR framework adapted to variable duration activity bouts by (1) detecting the change points of activity bouts in a multivariate time series and (2) predicting activity for each homogeneous window defined by these change points. We applied standard fixed-width sliding windows (4-6 different sizes) or greedy Gaussian segmentation (GGS) to identify break points in filtered triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope data. After standard feature engineering, we applied an Xgboost model to predict physical activity within each window and then converted windowed predictions to instantaneous predictions to facilitate comparison across segmentation methods. We applied these methods in 2 datasets: the human activity recognition using smartphones (HARuS) dataset where a total of 30 adults performed activities of approximately equal duration (approximately 20 seconds each) while wearing a waist-worn smartphone, and the Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation for Pediatric Asthma (BREATHE) dataset where a total of 14 children performed 6 activities for approximately 10 min each while wearing a smartwatch. To mimic a real-world scenario, we generated artificial unequal activity bout durations in the BREATHE data by randomly subdividing each activity bout into 10 segments and randomly concatenating the 60 activity bouts. Each dataset was divided into ~90% training and ~10% holdout testing. In the HARuS data, GGS produced the least noisy predictions of 6 physical activities and had the second highest accuracy rate of 91.06% (the highest accuracy rate was 91.79% for the sliding window of size 0.8 second). In the BREATHE data, GGS again produced the least noisy predictions and had the highest accuracy rate of 79.4% of predictions for 6 physical activities. In a scenario with variable duration activity bouts, GGS multivariate segmentation produced smart-sized windows with more stable predictions and a higher accuracy rate than traditional fixed-size sliding window approaches. Overall, accuracy was good in both datasets but, as expected, it was slightly lower in the more real-world study using wrist-worn smartwatches in children (BREATHE) than in the more tightly controlled study using waist-worn smartphones in adults (HARuS). We implemented GGS in an offline setting, but it could be adapted for real-time prediction with streaming data.",

    "title": "Comparing Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms and Metrics for Estrogen Receptor Binding Prediction.",
    "abstract": "Many chemicals that disrupt endocrine function have been linked to a variety of adverse biological outcomes. However, screening for endocrine disruption using in vitro or in vivo approaches is costly and time-consuming. Computational methods, e.g., quantitative structure-activity relationship models, have become more reliable due to bigger training sets, increased computing power, and advanced machine learning algorithms, such as multilayered artificial neural networks. Machine learning models can be used to predict compounds for endocrine disrupting capabilities, such as binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), and allow for prioritization and further testing. In this work, an exhaustive comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, chemical spaces, and evaluation metrics for ER binding was performed on public data sets curated using in-house cheminformatics software (Assay Central). Chemical features utilized in modeling consisted of binary fingerprints (ECFP6, FCFP6, ToxPrint, or MACCS keys) and continuous molecular descriptors from RDKit. Each feature set was subjected to classic machine learning algorithms (Bernoulli Naive Bayes, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Models were evaluated using a variety of metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Cohen's Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient. For predicting compounds within the training set, DNN has an accuracy higher than that of other methods; however, in 5-fold cross validation and external test set predictions, DNN and most classic machine learning models perform similarly regardless of the data set or molecular descriptors used. We have also used the rank normalized scores as a performance-criteria for each machine learning method, and Random Forest performed best on the validation set when ranked by metric or by data sets. These results suggest classic machine learning algorithms may be sufficient to develop high quality predictive models of ER activity.",

We show that under a specific realistic conditional independence assumption, the hint information can be included by late fusion. In two experiments involving image classification with hints taking the form of text metadata, we demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the fusion scheme. We fuse the output of pre-trained image classifiers with the output of pre-trained text models. We show that calibration of the pre-trained models is crucial for the performance of the fused model. We compare the performance of the fusion scheme with a mid-level fusion scheme based on support vector machines and find that these two methods tend to perform quite similarly, albeit the late fusion scheme has only negligible computational costs.",

This paper experimentally investigated the degree to which a state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), a popular Machine Learning approach, can correctly distinguish modern conceptual art work into the galleries devised by art curators. Two hypotheses were proposed to state that the DCNN model uses Exhibited Properties for classification, like shape and color, but not Non-Exhibited Properties, such as historical context and artist intention. The two hypotheses were experimentally validated using a methodology designed for this purpose. VGG-11 DCNN pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and discriminatively fine-tuned was trained on handcrafted datasets designed from real-world conceptual photography galleries. Experimental results supported the two hypotheses showing that the DCNN model ignores Non-Exhibited Properties and uses only Exhibited Properties for artwork classification.

    "title": "Explainable Deep Relational Networks for Predicting Compound-Protein Affinities and Contacts.",
    "abstract": "Predicting compound-protein affinity is beneficial for accelerating drug discovery. Doing so without the often-unavailable structure data is gaining interest. However, recent progress in structure-free affinity prediction, made by machine learning, focuses on accuracy but leaves much to be desired for interpretability. Defining intermolecular contacts underlying affinities as a vehicle for interpretability; our large-scale interpretability assessment finds previously used attention mechanisms inadequate. We thus formulate a hierarchical multiobjective learning problem, where predicted contacts form the basis for predicted affinities. We solve the problem by embedding protein sequences (by hierarchical recurrent neural networks) and compound graphs (by graph neural networks) with joint attentions between protein residues and compound atoms. We further introduce three methodological advances to enhance interpretability: (1) structure-aware regularization of attentions using protein sequence-predicted solvent exposure and residue-residue contact maps; (2) supervision of attentions using known intermolecular contacts in training data; and (3) an intrinsically explainable architecture where atomic-level contacts or \"relations\" lead to molecular-level affinity prediction. The first two and all three advances result in DeepAffinity+ and DeepRelations, respectively. Our methods show generalizability in affinity prediction for molecules that are new and dissimilar to training examples. Moreover, they show superior interpretability compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods: with similar or better affinity prediction, they boost the AUPRC of contact prediction by around 33-, 35-, 10-, and 9-fold for the default test, new-compound, new-protein, and both-new sets, respectively. We further demonstrate their potential utilities in contact-assisted docking, structure-free binding site prediction, and structure-activity relationship studies without docking. Our study represents the first model development and systematic model assessment dedicated to interpretable machine learning for structure-free compound-protein affinity prediction.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability of large datasets (\"big data\"), substantial advances in computing power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature, better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program use across different imaging platforms and patient populations. AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract \"radiomic\" information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists. AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data. Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a leading role in medical applications of AI.",

In order to improve the estimation accuracy, we devise genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimisation and feature extraction within the proposed methods. At the same time, a load cell and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) are mounted on the robot to measure the muscle force and knee joint angle, respectively. Various performance measures have been employed to assess the performance of the proposed system. Our extensive experiments and comparison with related works revealed a high estimation accuracy of 98.67% for lower limb muscles. The main advantage of the proposed techniques is high estimation accuracy leading to improved performance of the therapy while muscle models become especially sensitive to the tendon stiffness and the slack length.

We show that the performance of support vector machines is competitive with that of deep learning methods. Additionally, using a series of numerical experiments, we question the relevance of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as a metric in virtual screening. We further suggest that area under the precision-recall curve should be used in conjunction with the receiver operating characteristic curve.

We focused on developing a system that recognizes and classifies voluntary effort and detects phases of fatigue. The experiment was designed to extract and evaluate hand-tremor data during the performance of both rest and effort tasks. The data were collected from the wrist and finger of the participant's dominant hand. To investigate tremor, time, frequency domain features were extracted from the accelerometer signal for segments of 45 and 90 samples/window. Analysis using advanced signal processing and machine-learning techniques such as decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and ensemble classifiers were applied to discover models to classify rest and effort tasks and the phases of fatigue. Evaluation of the classifier's performance was assessed based on various metrics using 5-fold cross-validation. The recognition of rest and effort tasks using an ensemble classifier based on the random subspace and window length of 45 samples was deemed to be the most accurate (96.1%).

The prediction results based on the main model training use a k-nearest neighbor model for secondary training so as to improve the accuracy of coronary heart disease prediction. The comparison between the model prediction results and the clinical diagnostic results shows that the prediction model has a prediction accuracy rate of 82.8%, a prediction precision rate of 87.08%, a prediction recall rate of 88.57%, a prediction F1-score of 87.82%, and an area under the curve value of 0.8 in the test set.

Consequently, the identification of novel effector proteins is an important step in increasing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we train and compare six machine learning models, namely, Naïve Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), for the identification of T4SEs using 10 types of selected features and 5-fold cross-validation. Our study shows that: (1) including different but complementary features generally enhance the predictive performance of T4SEs; (2) ensemble models, obtained by integrating individual single-feature models, exhibit a significantly improved predictive performance and (3) the 'majority voting strategy' led to a more stable and accurate classification performance when applied to predicting an ensemble learning model with distinct single features. We further developed a new method to effectively predict T4SEs, Bastion4 (Bacterial secretion effector predictor for T4SS), and we show our ensemble classifier clearly outperforms two recent prediction tools. In summary, we developed a state-of-the-art T4SE predictor by conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of different machine learning algorithms along with a detailed analysis of single- and multi-feature selections.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have revolutionized an extensive range of research and industry fields by successfully addressing intricate problems that cannot be resolved with conventional approaches. However, low interpretability and incompatibility make it challenging to apply ML to complicated bioprocesses, which rely on the delicate metabolic interplay among living cells. This overview attempts to delineate ML applications to bioprocess from different perspectives, and their inherent limitations (i.e., uncertainties in prediction) were then discussed with unique attempts to supplement the ML models. A clear classification can be made depending on the purpose of the ML (supervised vs unsupervised) per application, as well as on their system boundaries (engineered vs natural). Although a limited number of hybrid approaches with meaningful outcomes (e.g., improved accuracy) are available, there is still a need to further enhance the interpretability, compatibility, and user-friendliness of ML models.",

    "title": "Development and validation of consensus machine learning-based models for the prediction of novel small molecules as potential anti-tubercular agents.",
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and the leading cause of death globally. The rapidly emerging cases of drug resistance among pathogenic mycobacteria have been a global threat urging the need of new drug discovery and development. However, considering the fact that the new drug discovery and development is commonly lengthy and costly processes, strategic use of the cutting-edge machine learning (ML) algorithms may be very supportive in reducing both the cost and time involved. Considering the urgency of new drugs for TB, herein, we have attempted to develop predictive ML algorithms-based models useful in the selection of novel potential small molecules for subsequent in vitro validation. For this purpose, we used the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) TCAMS TB dataset comprising a total of 776 hits that were made publicly available to the wider scientific community through the ChEMBL Neglected Tropical Diseases (ChEMBL-NTD) database. After exploring the different ML classifiers, viz. decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and linear logistic regression (LLR), and ensemble learning models (bagging and Adaboost) for training the model using the GSK dataset, we concluded with three best models, viz. Adaboost decision tree (ABDT), RF classifier, and k-NN models that gave the top prediction results for both the training and test sets. However, during the prediction of the external set of known anti-tubercular compounds/drugs, it was realized that each of these models had some limitations. The ABDT model correctly predicted 22 molecules as actives, while both the RF and k-NN models predicted 18 molecules correctly as actives; a number of molecules were predicted as actives by two of these models, while the third model predicted these compounds as inactives. Therefore, we concluded that while deciding the anti-tubercular potential of a new molecule, one should rely on the use of consensus predictions using these three models; it may lessen the attrition rate during the in vitro validation. We believe that this study may assist the wider anti-tuberculosis research community by providing a platform for predicting small molecules with subsequent validation for drug discovery and development.",

    "abstract": "Drug registration requires risk assessment of new active pharmaceutical ingredients or excipients to ensure they are safe for human health and the environment. However, traditional risk assessment is expensive and relies heavily on animal testing. Machine learning (ML) has been used as a risk assessment tool, providing less time, money, and involved animals than in vivo experiments. Despite that, the ML models often rely on a single model, which may introduce bias and unreliable prediction. Stacking ensemble learning is an ML framework that makes predictions based on multimodal outcomes. This framework performs well in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. In this study, we developed ToxSTK, a multi-target toxicity assessment using stacking ensemble learning. We aimed to create an ML tool that facilitates toxicity assessments more affordably with reduced reliance on animal models. We focused on four key targets generally assessed in early-stage drug development: hERG toxicity, mTOR toxicity, PBMCs toxicity, and mutagenicity. Our model integrated 12 molecular fingerprints with 3 ML algorithms, generating 36 novel predictive features (PFs). These PFs were then combined to construct the final meta-decision model. Our results demonstrated that the ToxSTK model surpasses standard regression and classification metrics, ensuring it is highly reliable and accurate in predicting chemical toxicities within its application domain. This model passed the y-randomization test, confirming that the identified QSAR is robust and not due to random chance. Additionally, this model outperforms the existing ML methods for these endpoints, suggesting its effectiveness for risk assessment applications. We recommend incorporating this stacking ensemble learning framework into the chemical risk assessment pipeline to improve model generalization, accuracy, robustness, and reliability.",

    "abstract": "The present study examines the role of feature selection methods in optimizing machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. The Cleveland Heart disease dataset with sixteen feature selection techniques in three categories of filter, wrapper, and evolutionary were used. Then seven algorithms Bayes net, Naïve Bayes (BN), multivariate linear model (MLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logit boost, j48, and Random Forest were applied to identify the best models for heart disease prediction. Precision, F-measure, Specificity, Accuracy, Sensitivity, ROC area, and PRC were measured to compare feature selection methods' effect on prediction algorithms. The results demonstrate that feature selection resulted in significant improvements in model performance in some methods (e.g., j48), whereas it led to a decrease in model performance in other models (e.g. MLP, RF). SVM-based filtering methods have a best-fit accuracy of 85.5. In fact, in a best-case scenario, filtering methods result in + 2.3 model accuracy. SVM-CFS/information gain/Symmetrical uncertainty methods have the highest improvement in this index. The filter feature selection methods with the highest number of features selected outperformed other methods in terms of models' ACC, Precision, and F-measures. However, wrapper-based and evolutionary algorithms improved models' performance from sensitivity and specificity points of view.",

However, the development of artificial intelligence has allowed the machine to gain a high level of understanding to perceive and extract information from biomedical images. Deep learning models, in particular, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were developed and implemented successfully for various biomedical applications. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for healthcare practitioners to understand the mechanisms behind the implemented CNNs to accurately interpret their outcomes. This tutorial summarises the key steps to train a functional CNNs. CNNs are usually constructed in the order of a convolution operation, ReLU, spatial pooling and followed by the fully connected layers. In addition, we have also introduced a number of preprocessing methods that target the image augmentation to combat the sparse data problem. We further explored a generative model as an augmentation method known as the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where GANs may yield new useful information to the dataset as compared to the classical augmentation.",

Three approaches were undertaken to predict the grouped carcass cut yields of Grilling cuts and Roasting cuts from a large dataset of 54,598 and 69,246 animals respectively. The approaches taken were (1) animal phenotypic data used as features for a range of ML algorithms, (2) carcass images used to train Convolutional Neural Networks, and (3) carcass dimensions measured directly from the carcass images, combined with the associated phenotypic data and used as feature data for ML algorithms. Results showed that DL models can be trained to predict carcass cuts yields but an approach that uses carcass dimensions in ML algorithms performs slightly better in absolute terms.",

Recurrence of CRC (Re) and onset of a second primary malignancy (SPM) are important indicators in treating CRC, but it is often difficult to predict the onset of a SPM. Therefore, we used mechanical learning to identify risk factors that affect Re and SPM. CRC patients with cancer registry database at three medical centers were identified. All patients were classified based on Re or no recurrence (NRe) as well as SPM or no SPM (NSPM). Two classifiers, namely A Library for Support Vector Machines (LIBSVM) and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), were applied to analyze the relationship between clinical features and Re and/or SPM category by constructing optimized models. When Re and SPM were evaluated separately, the accuracy of LIBSVM was 0.878 and that of REPTree was 0.622. When Re and SPM were evaluated in combination, the precision of models for SPM+Re, NSPM+Re, SPM+NRe, and NSPM+NRe was 0.878, 0.662, 0.774, and 0.778, respectively. Machine learning can be used to rank factors affecting tumor Re and SPM. In clinical practice, routine checkups are necessary to ensure early detection of new tumors. The success of prediction and early detection may be enhanced in the future by applying \"big data\" analysis methods such as machine learning.",

Machine learning is a model from past data for future data prediction. From post-marketing monitoring, we aimed to construct a machine learning algorithm to efficiently and rapidly predict hyperglycemic adverse reaction in patients using PD-1/L1 inhibitors. In original data downloaded from Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (US FAERS), a multivariate pattern classification of support vector machine (SVM) was used to construct a classifier to separate adverse hyperglycemic reaction patients. With correct core SVM function, a 10-fold 3-time cross validation optimized parameter value composition in model setup with R language software. The SVM prediction model was set up from the number type/number optimization method, as well as the kernel and type of \"rbf\" and \"nu-regression\" composition. Two key values (nu and gamma) and case number displayed high adjusted in curve regressions ( = 0.5649 × , gamma = 9.005 × 10 × case - 4.877 × 10 × case ). This SVM model with computable parameters greatly improved the assessing indexes (accuracy, F1 score, and kappa) as well as coequal sensitivity and the area under the curve (AUC). We constructed an effective machine learning model based on compositions of exact kernels and computable parameters; the SVM prediction model can noninvasively and precisely predict hyperglycemic adverse drug reaction (ADR) in patients treated with PD-1/L1 inhibitors, which could greatly help clinical practitioners to identify high-risk patients and perform preventive measurements in time. Besides, this model setup process provided an analytic conception for promotion to other ADR prediction, such ADR information is vital for outcome improvement by identifying high-risk patients, and this machine learning algorithm can eventually add value to clinical decision making.",

Classification performance with several feature sets was analyzed to understand the relative importance of different types of information and provide insights. The most important features are found as whether the patient performs self-monitoring, smoking and exercise habits, education, and socio-economic status. The best performance was achieved with the Logistic Regression algorithm, with Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.72 with the best performing feature set. Alternative feature sets with similar prediction performance are also presented.

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a widespread disease among people. It is related to various serious risks like cardiovascular disease, heightened risk, and end-stage renal disease, which can be feasibly avoidable by early detection and treatment of people in danger of this disease. The machine learning algorithm is a source of significant assistance for medical scientists to diagnose the disease accurately in its outset stage. Recently, Big Data platforms are integrated with machine learning algorithms to add value to healthcare. Therefore, this paper proposes hybrid machine learning techniques that include feature selection methods and machine learning classification algorithms based on big data platforms (Apache Spark) that were used to detect chronic kidney disease (CKD). The feature selection techniques, namely, Relief-F and chi-squared feature selection method, were applied to select the important features. Six machine learning classification algorithms were used in this research: decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT Classifier) as ensemble learning algorithms. Four methods of evaluation, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure, were applied to validate the results. For each algorithm, the results of cross-validation and the testing results have been computed based on full features, the features selected by Relief-F, and the features selected by chi-squared feature selection method. The results showed that SVM, DT, and GBT Classifiers with the selected features had achieved the best performance at 100% accuracy. Overall, Relief-F's selected features are better than full features and the features selected by chi-square.",

Models that generalize well beyond training data can be used to identify combinatorial perturbations of potential therapeutic interest. Major challenges for machine learning on large biological datasets are to find global optima in a complex multidimensional space and mechanistically interpret the solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines explicit mathematical models of cell dynamics with a machine-learning framework, implemented in TensorFlow. We tested the modeling framework on a perturbation-response dataset of a melanoma cell line after drug treatments. The models can be efficiently trained to describe cellular behavior accurately. Even though completely data driven and independent of prior knowledge, the resulting de novo network models recapitulate some known interactions. The approach is readily applicable to various kinetic models of cell biology. A record of this paper's Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.",

With the experience of patients with cancer in mind, we reviewed whether anyone has proposed, modeled, or applied machine learning technologies for the assessment of patient education materials and explored the utility of this application. We systematically searched the literature to identify English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals or as conference abstracts that proposed, used, or modeled the use of machine learning technology to assess patient education materials. Specifically, we searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Compendex. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility and performed study screening. We identified 1,570 publications in our search after duplicate removal. After screening, we included five projects (detailed in nine articles) that proposed, modeled, or used machine learning technology to assess the quality of patient education materials. We evaluated the utility of each application across four domains: multidimensionality (2 of 5 applications), patient centeredness (1 of 5 applications), customizability (0 of 5 applications), and development stage (theoretical, 1 of 5 applications; in development, 3 of 5 applications; complete and available, 1 of 5 applications). Combining points across each domain, the mean utlity score across included projects was 1.8 of 5 possible points. Given its potential, machine learning has not yet been leveraged substantially in the assessment of patient education materials. We propose machine learning systems that can dynamically identify problematic language and content by assessing the quality of patient education materials across a range of flexible, customizable criteria. Assessment may help patients and families decide which materials to use and encourage developers to improve materials overall.",

    "title": "Automated Machine Learning Pipeline Framework for Classification of Pediatric Functional Nausea Using High-Resolution Electrogastrogram.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric functional nausea is challenging for patients to manage and for clinicians to treat since it lacks objective diagnosis and assessment. A data-driven non-invasive diagnostic screening tool that distinguishes the electro-pathophysiology of pediatric functional nausea from healthy controls would be an invaluable aid to support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and management of patient treatment methodology. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative approach for objectively classifying pediatric functional nausea using cutaneous high-resolution electrogastrogram data. We present an Automated Electrogastrogram Data Analytics Pipeline framework and demonstrate its use in a 3x8 factorial design to identify an optimal classification model according to a defined objective function. Low-fidelity synthetic high-resolution electrogastrogram data were generated to validate outputs and determine SOBI-ICA noise reduction effectiveness. A 10 parameter support vector machine binary classifier with a radial basis function kernel was selected as the overall top-performing model from a pool of over 1000 alternatives via maximization of an objective function. This resulted in a 91.6% test ROC AUC score. Using an automated machine learning pipeline approach to process high-resolution electrogastrogram data allows for clinically significant objective classification of pediatric functional nausea. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate clinically significant performance in the objective classification of pediatric nausea patients from healthy control subjects using experimental high-resolution electrogastrogram data. These results indicate a promising potential for high-resolution electrogastrography to serve as a data-driven screening tool for the objective diagnosis of pediatric functional nausea.",

    "title": "On the Early and Affordable Diagnosis of Joint Pathologies Using Acoustic Emissions, Deep Learning Decompositions and Prediction Machines.",
    "abstract": "The condition of a joint in a human being is prone to wear and several pathologies, particularly in the elderly and athletes. Current means towards assessing the overall condition of a joint to assess for a pathology involve using tools such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, to name a couple. These expensive methods are of limited availability in resource-constrained environments and pose the risk of radiation exposure to the patient. The prospect of acoustic emissions (AEs) presents a modality that can monitor the joints' conditions passively by recording the high-frequency stress waves emitted during their motion. One of the main challenges associated with this sensing method is decoding and linking acquired AE signals to their source event. In this paper, we investigate AEs' use to identify five kinds of joint-wear pathologies using a contrast of expert-based handcrafted features and unsupervised feature learning via deep wavelet decomposition (DWS) alongside 12 machine learning models. The results showed an average classification accuracy of 90 ± 7.16% and 97 ± 3.77% for the handcrafted and DWS-based features, implying good prediction accuracies across the various devised approaches. Subsequent work will involve the potential application of regressions towards estimating the associated stage and extent of a wear condition where present, which can form part of an online system for the condition monitoring of joints in human beings.",

    "title": "Maximum Decentral Projection Margin Classifier for High Dimension and Low Sample Size problems.",
    "abstract": "Compared with relatively easy feature creation or generation in data analysis, manual data labeling needs a lot of time and effort in most cases. Even if automated data labeling​ seems to make it better in some cases, the labeling results still need to be checked and verified by manual. The High Dimension and Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data are therefore very common in data mining and machine learning. For classification problems with the HDLSS data, due to data piling and approximate equidistance between any two input points in high-dimension space, some traditional classifiers often give poor predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a Maximum Decentral Projection Margin Classifier (MDPMC) in the framework of a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). In the MDPMC model, the constraints of maximizing the projection distance between decentralized input points and their supporting hyperplane are integrated into the SVC model in addition to maximizing the margin of two supporting hyperplanes. On ten real HDLSS datasets, the experiment results show that the proposed MDPMC approach can deal well with data piling and approximate equidistance problems. Compared with SVC with Linear Kernel (SVC-LK) and Radial Basis Function Kernel (SVC-RBFK), Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), weighted DWD (wDWD), Distance-Weighted Support Vector Machine (DWSVM), Population-Guided Large Margin Classifier (PGLMC), and Data Maximum Dispersion Classifier (DMDC), MDPMC obtains better predictive accuracy and lower classification errors than the other seven classifiers on the HDLSS data.",

    "title": "Deep learning-based behavioral analysis reaches human accuracy and is capable of outperforming commercial solutions.",
    "abstract": "To study brain function, preclinical research heavily relies on animal monitoring and the subsequent analyses of behavior. Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by automating animal tracking, yet they poorly recognize ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to be employed in variable testing environments. Critical advances based on deep-learning and machine vision over the last couple of years now enable markerless tracking of individual body parts of freely moving rodents with high precision. Here, we compare the performance of commercially available platforms (EthoVision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi-Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. We provide a set of videos-carefully annotated by several human raters-of three widely used behavioral tests (open field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we then deployed the pose estimation software DeepLabCut to extract skeletal mouse representations. Using simple post-analyses, we were able to track animals based on their skeletal representation in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or greater accuracy than commercial behavioral tracking systems. We then developed supervised machine learning classifiers that integrate the skeletal representation with the manual annotations. This new combined approach allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, while outperforming commercial solutions. Finally, we show that the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, while outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.",

    "abstract": "Orodispersible films (ODFs) have emerged as innovative pharmaceutical dosage forms, offering patient-specific treatment through adjustable dosing and the combination of diverse active ingredients. This expanding field generates vast datasets, requiring advanced analytical techniques for deeper understanding of data itself. Machine learning is becoming an important tool in the rapidly changing field of pharmaceutical research, particularly in drug preformulation studies. This work aims to explore into the application of machine learning methods for the analysis of experimental data obtained by ODF characterization in order to obtain an insight into the factors governing ODF performance and use it as guidance in pharmaceutical development. Using a dataset derived from extensive experimental studies, various machine learning algorithms were employed to cluster and predict critical properties of ODFs. Our results demonstrate that machine learning models, including Support vector machine, Random forest and Deep learning, exhibit high accuracy in predicting the mechanical properties of ODFs, such as flexibility and rigidity. The predictive models offered insights into the complex interaction of formulation variables.

    "title": "Interactive Deep Learning for Shelf Life Prediction of Muskmelons Based on an Active Learning Approach.",
    "abstract": "A pivotal topic in agriculture and food monitoring is the assessment of the quality and ripeness of agricultural products by using non-destructive testing techniques. Acoustic testing offers a rapid in situ analysis of the state of the agricultural good, obtaining global information of its interior. While deep learning (DL) methods have outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks in various applications, the reason for lacking adaptation of DL algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be traced back to its high data inefficiency and the absence of annotated data. Active learning is a framework that has been heavily used in machine learning when the labelled instances are scarce or cumbersome to obtain. This is specifically of interest when the DL algorithm is highly uncertain about the label of an instance. By allowing the human-in-the-loop for guidance, a continuous improvement of the DL algorithm based on a sample efficient manner can be obtained. This paper seeks to study the applicability of active learning when grading 'Galia' muskmelons based on its shelf life. We propose -Determinantal Point Processes ( -DPP), which is a purely diversity-based method that allows to take influence on the exploration within the feature space based on the chosen subset . While getting coequal results to uncertainty-based approaches when is large, we simultaneously obtain a better exploration of the data distribution. While the implementation based on eigendecomposition takes up a runtime of O(n3), this can further be reduced to O(n·poly(k)) based on rejection sampling. We suggest the use of diversity-based acquisition when only a few labelled samples are available, allowing for better exploration while counteracting the disadvantage of missing the training objective in uncertainty-based methods following a greedy fashion.",

Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.",

This has considerable implications for the regulation of drug development processes, as it is expected to transform both the way drugs are brought to market and the systems through which this process is controlled. There is currently insufficient evidence in published literature of the real-world applications of AI. Therefore, this narrative review investigated, collated, and elucidated the applications of AI in drug development and its regulatory processes. A narrative review was conducted to ascertain the role of AI in streamlining drug development and regulatory processes. The findings of this review revealed that machine learning or deep learning, natural language processing, and robotic process automation were favored applications of AI. Each of them had considerable implications on the operations they were intended to support. Overall, the AI tools facilitated access and provided manageability of information for decision-making across the drug development lifecycle. However, the findings also indicate that additional work is required by regulatory authorities to set out appropriate guidance on applications of the technology, which has critical implications for safety, regulatory process workflow and product development costs.

    "title": "A voting-based machine learning approach for classifying biological and clinical datasets.",
    "abstract": "Different machine learning techniques have been proposed to classify a wide range of biological/clinical data. Given the practicability of these approaches accordingly, various software packages have been also designed and developed. However, the existing methods suffer from several limitations such as overfitting on a specific dataset, ignoring the feature selection concept in the preprocessing step, and losing their performance on large-size datasets. To tackle the mentioned restrictions, in this study, we introduced a machine learning framework consisting of two main steps. First, our previously suggested optimization algorithm (Trader) was extended to select a near-optimal subset of features/genes. Second, a voting-based framework was proposed to classify the biological/clinical data with high accuracy. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, it was applied to 13 biological/clinical datasets, and the outcomes were comprehensively compared with the prior methods. The results demonstrated that the Trader algorithm could select a near-optimal subset of features with a significant level of p-value < 0.01 relative to the compared algorithms. Additionally, on the large-sie datasets, the proposed machine learning framework improved prior studies by ~ 10% in terms of the mean values associated with fivefold cross-validation of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F-measure. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that a proper configuration of efficient algorithms and methods can increase the prediction power of machine learning approaches and help researchers in designing practical diagnosis health care systems and offering effective treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "Secondary active transporters play pivotal roles in regulating ion and molecule transport across cell membranes, with implications in diseases like cancer. However, studying transporters via biochemical experiments poses challenges. We propose an effective computational approach to identify secondary active transporters from membrane protein sequences using pre-trained language models and deep learning neural networks. Our dataset comprised 290 secondary active transporters and 5,420 other membrane proteins from UniProt. Three types of features were extracted - one-hot encodings, position-specific scoring matrix profiles, and contextual embeddings from the ProtTrans language model. A multi-window convolutional neural network architecture scanned the ProtTrans embeddings using varying window sizes to capture multi-scale sequence patterns. The proposed model combining ProtTrans embeddings and multi-window convolutional neural networks achieved 86% sensitivity, 99% specificity and 98% overall accuracy in identifying secondary active transporters, outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. This work demonstrates the promise of integrating pre-trained language models like ProtTrans with multi-scale deep neural networks to effectively interpret transporter sequences for functional analysis. Our approach enables more accurate computational identification of secondary active transporters, advancing membrane protein research.",

    "title": "al-BERT: a semi-supervised denoising technique for disease prediction.",
    "abstract": "Medical records are a valuable source for understanding patient health conditions. Doctors often use these records to assess health without solely depending on time-consuming and complex examinations. However, these records may not always be directly relevant to a patient's current health issue. For instance, information about common colds may not be relevant to a more specific health condition. While experienced doctors can effectively navigate through unnecessary details in medical records, this excess information presents a challenge for machine learning models in predicting diseases electronically. To address this, we have developed 'al-BERT', a new disease prediction model that leverages the BERT framework. This model is designed to identify crucial information from medical records and use it to predict diseases. 'al-BERT' operates on the principle that the structure of sentences in diagnostic records is similar to regular linguistic patterns. However, just as stuttering in speech can introduce 'noise' or irrelevant information, similar issues can arise in written records, complicating model training. To overcome this, 'al-BERT' incorporates a semi-supervised layer that filters out irrelevant data from patient visitation records. This process aims to refine the data, resulting in more reliable indicators for disease correlations and enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and utility in medical diagnostics. To discern noise diseases within patient records, especially those resembling influenza-like illnesses, our approach employs a customized semi-supervised learning algorithm equipped with a focused attention mechanism. This mechanism is specifically calibrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to chronic conditions while concurrently distilling salient features from patient records, thereby augmenting the predictive accuracy and utility of the model in clinical settings. We evaluate the performance of al-BERT using real-world health insurance data provided by Taiwan's National Health Insurance. In our study, we evaluated our model against two others: one based on BERT that uses complete disease records, and another variant that includes extra filtering techniques. Our findings show that models incorporating filtering mechanisms typically perform better than those using the entire, unfiltered dataset. Our approach resulted in improved outcomes across several key measures: AUC-ROC (an indicator of a model's ability to distinguish between classes), precision (the accuracy of positive predictions), recall (the model's ability to find all relevant cases), and overall accuracy. Most notably, our model showed a 15% improvement in recall compared to the current best-performing method in the field of disease prediction. The conducted ablation study affirms the advantages of our attention mechanism and underscores the crucial role of the selection module within al-BERT.",

We collected 1000 pregnant female samples from three different hospitals in Lahore, Punjab. A questionnaire has been designed to obtain a variety of data, such as gender, parenting, family history of cleft, the order of birth, the number of children, midwives counseling, miscarriage history, parent smoking, and physician visits. Different cleaning, scaling, and feature selection methods have been applied to the data collected. After selecting the best features from the cleft data, various machine learning algorithms were used, including random forest, -nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron. In our implementation, multilayer perceptron is a deep neural network, which yields excellent results for the cleft dataset compared to the other methods. We achieved 92.6% accuracy on test data based on the multilayer perceptron model. Our promising results of predictions would help to fight future clefts for children who would have cleft.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunist pathogen responsible for causing several infections in the human body, especially in patients with weak immune systems. The proposed approach reports a novel pathogens detection system based on cultivating microdroplets and acquiring the scattered light signals from the incubated droplets using a microfluidic device. Initially, the microdroplets were generated and incubated to cultivate bacteria inside the microdroplets. The second part of the microfluidic chip is the detection module, embedded with three optical fibers to connect laser light and photosensors. The incubated droplets were reinjected in the detection module and passed through the laser light. The surrounding photosensors were arranged symmetrically at 45° to the flowing channel for acquiring the scattered light signal. The noise was removed from the acquired data, and time-domain waveform features were evaluated. The acquired features were trained using machine learning classifiers to classify P. aeruginosa. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) showed superior classification performance with 95.6 % accuracy among other classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), and naïve Bayes (NB). The proposed research was performed to validate the method for pathogens detection with a concentration of 10 CFU/mL. The total duration of 6 h is required to test the sample, including five hours for droplets incubation and one hour for sample preparation and detection using light scattering module. The results indicate that acquiring the light scattering patterns from incubated droplets can detect P. aeruginosa using machine learning classification. The proposed system is anticipated to be helpful as a rapid device for diagnosing pathogenic infections.",

    "title": "Forecasting of compound ocean-fluvial floods using machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Flood modelling and forecasting can enhance our understanding of flood mechanisms and facilitate effective management of flood risk. Conventional flood hazard and risk assessments usually consider one driver at a time, whether it is ocean, fluvial or pluvial, without considering the compound nature of flood events. In this paper, we developed a novel approach for modelling and forecasting compound coastal-fluvial floods using a two-step framework. In step one, a hydrodynamic model is used to simulate floodwater propagation; while in step two, machine learning (ML) models are used to generate flood forecasts. The architecture of hydrodynamic-ML forecasting system incorporates a hydrodynamic model covering a specific domain, with individual ML models trained for each pixel. In total 7 ML models including: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Linear Regression (LR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Decision Tree (DT), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied in this study. Forecasting compound floods is achieved using two sets of inputs: timeseries of river discharges in the upstream fluvial section and downstream ocean water levels in the coastal areas. The accuracy of the flood forecasting system is demonstrated for Cork City, Ireland; and modelling performance was evaluated using several statistical tools. Results show that the proposed models can provide reliable estimates of flood inundation and associated water depths. Overall, the RBF model exhibits the best performance. Despite the complexity of compound multi-driver floods, this study shows that the coupled hydrodynamic-ML approach can forecast coastal-fluvial flood with limited hydraulic and hydrological input data. This system overcomes the limitations of traditional hydrodynamic model-based systems where trade-offs between the always competing numerical model accuracy and computational time prohibit the model to be used for short-term flood forecasting. Once trained, the ML component of the coupled system can perform flood forecasting in near real-time, potentially integrating into a flood early warning system. Accurate flood forecasting has a wide range of positive societal impacts, including improved flood preparedness, increased confidence, better resource allocation, reduced flood damage, and potentially even flood prevention.",

Based on the comparative analysis of the effectiveness of entropy calculation methods, fuzzy entropy showed the best results in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG, with classification accuracy ( ) of ~99.9%. The most important frequency range of rs-EEG for PD-based diagnostics lies in the range of 0-4 Hz, and the most informative signals were mainly received from the right hemisphere of the head. It was also found that significantly decreased as the length of rs-EEG segments decreased from 1000 to 150 samples. Using a procedure for selecting the most informative features, it was possible to reduce the computational costs of classification by 11 times, while maintaining an ~99.9%.

This can be achieved using suitable structure-free encoding and machine learning methods, but additional processing decisions are required. In this study, we compare a variety of structure-free materials encodings and machine learning algorithms to predict the structure/property relationships of battery materials. It was found that the physical units used to measure the property labels have an important impact on the predictive ability of the models, regardless of the computational approach. Property labels with respect to weight give excellent performance, but property labels with respect to volume cannot be predicted with confidence using only chemical information, even when the underlying physical characteristics are the same. These results contrast with previous studies of unsupervised learning and classification, where structure-free encoding excelled, and highlight how the structural features or property labels of materials are represented plays an important role in the predictive ability of machine learning models.",

Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "title": "The Development of Target-Specific Machine Learning Models as Scoring Functions for Docking-Based Target Prediction.",
    "abstract": "The identification of possible targets for a known bioactive compound is of the utmost importance for drug design and development. Molecular docking is one possible approach for in-silico protein target prediction, whereas a molecule is docked into several different protein structures to identify potential targets. This reverse docking approach is hampered by the limitation of current scoring functions to correctly discriminate between targets and nontargets. In this work, a development of target-specific scoring functions is described that showed improved prediction performances for the correct target prediction of both actives and decoys on three validation data sets. In contrast to pure ligand-based approaches, that are in general faster and include a greater target space, docking-based approaches can cover also unknown chemical space that lies outside the known bioactivity data. These target-specific scoring functions are based on known bioactivity data retrieved from ChEMBL and supervised machine learning approaches. Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) models were trained for 20 different protein targets. Our protein-ligand interaction fingerprint PADIF (Protein Atom Score Contributions Derived Interaction Fingerprint) represents the input for training, whereas the PADIFs are calculated based on docking poses of active and inactive compounds. Different data sets of previously unseen molecules were used for the final evaluation and analysis of the prediction performance of the created models. For a single-target selectivity data set, the correct target model returns in most of the cases the highest probabilities scores for their active molecules and with statistically significant differences from the other targets. These probability scores were also predicted and successfully used to rank the targets for molecules of a multitarget data set with activity data described simultaneously for two, three, and four to seven protein targets.",

    "abstract": "Evaporation is the primary aspect causing water loss in the hydrological cycle; therefore, water loss must be precisely measured. Evaporation is an intricate nonlinear process occurring as a result of several climatic aspects. The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of using Random Forest (RF) and two deep learning techniques, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep neural network (DNN) to accurately estimate monthly pan evaporation rates. Month-based weather data gathered from four Malaysian weather stations during the 2000-2019 timeframe was used to train and evaluate the models. Several input attributes (predictor variables) were investigated to select the most suitable variables for machine learning models. Every approach was tested with several models, each with a different set of model aspects and input parameter combinations. The formulated ML approaches were benchmarked against two commonly used empirical methods: Stephens & Stewart and Thornthwaite. Model outcomes were assessed using standard statistical measures to determine their effectiveness in predicting evaporation. The results indicated that the three ML models developed in the study performed better than empirical models and could significantly improve the precision of monthly Ep estimates even with the identical input sets. The performance assessment metrics also show that the formulated CNN approach was acceptable for modelling monthly water loss due to evaporation with a higher degree of accuracy than other ML frameworks explored in this study. In addition, the CNN framework outperformed other AI techniques evaluated for the same areas using identical data inputs. The investigation's findings in relation to the various performance criteria show that the proposed CNN model is capable of capturing the highly non-linearity of evaporation and could be regarded as an effective tool to predict evaporation.",

    "abstract": "Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are becoming an increasingly important design. However, authors of CRTs do not always adhere to requirements to explicitly identify the design as cluster randomized in titles and abstracts, making retrieval from bibliographic databases difficult. Machine learning algorithms may improve their identification and retrieval. Therefore, we aimed to develop machine learning algorithms that accurately determine whether a bibliographic citation is a CRT report. We trained, internally validated, and externally validated two convolutional neural networks and one support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a citation is a CRT report or not. We exclusively used the information in an article citation, including the title, abstract, keywords, and subject headings. The algorithms' output was a probability from 0 to 1. We assessed algorithm performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves. Each algorithm's performance was evaluated individually and together as an ensemble. We randomly selected 5000 from 87,633 citations to train and internally validate our algorithms. Of the 5000 selected citations, 589 (12%) were confirmed CRT reports. We then externally validated our algorithms on an independent set of 1916 randomized trial citations, with 665 (35%) confirmed CRT reports. In internal validation, the ensemble algorithm discriminated best for identifying CRT reports with an AUC of 98.6% (95% confidence interval: 97.8%, 99.4%), sensitivity of 97.7% (94.3%, 100%), and specificity of 85.0% (81.8%, 88.1%). In external validation, the ensemble algorithm had an AUC of 97.8% (97.0%, 98.5%), sensitivity of 97.6% (96.4%, 98.6%), and specificity of 78.2% (75.9%, 80.4%)). All three individual algorithms performed well, but less so than the ensemble. We successfully developed high-performance algorithms that identified whether a citation was a CRT report with high sensitivity and moderately high specificity. We provide open-source software to facilitate the use of our algorithms in practice.",

This work proposes a machine learning model based on multi-feature fusion to effectively identify the roles of positive and negative regulation of apoptosis. Initially, we constructed a reliable benchmark dataset containing 200 positive regulation of apoptosis and 241 negative regulation of apoptosis proteins. Subsequently, we developed a classifier that combines the support vector machine (SVM) with pseudo composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (PseCKSAAP), composition transition distribution (CTD), dipeptide deviation from expected mean (DDE), and PSSM-composition to identify these proteins. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to select optimized features that could yield the maximum prediction performance. Evaluating the proposed model on independent data revealed and achieved an accuracy of 0.781 with an AUROC of 0.837, demonstrating our model's potent capabilities.",

Following administration, NCs typically interact with multiple target proteins to elicit their effects. Various machine learning models have been developed to predict multi-target modulating NCs with desired physiological effects. However, due to deficiencies with existing chemical-protein interaction datasets, which are mostly single-labeled and limited, the existing models struggle to predict new chemical-protein interactions. New techniques are needed to overcome these limitations. We propose a novel NC discovery model called OptNCMiner that offers various advantages. The model is trained via end-to-end learning with a feature extraction step implemented, and it predicts multi-target modulating NCs through multi-label learning. In addition, it offers a few-shot learning approach to predict NC-protein interactions using a small training dataset. OptNCMiner achieved better prediction performance in terms of recall than conventional classification models. It was tested for the prediction of NC-protein interactions using small datasets and for a use case scenario to identify multi-target modulating NCs for type 2 diabetes mellitus complications. OptNCMiner identifies NCs that modulate multiple target proteins, which facilitates the discovery and the understanding of biological activity of novel NCs with desirable health benefits.",

A well-known challenge to use clinical text for detection of ADEs is that much of the detailed information is documented in a narrative manner. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract information from unstructured clinical text. We present a machine learning-based clinical NLP system-MADEx-for detecting medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical notes. We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) strategy for clinical name entity recognition (NER) and compared it with baseline conditional random fields (CRFs). We also developed a modified training strategy for the RNN, which outperformed the widely used early stop strategy. For relation extraction, we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests on single-sentence relations and cross-sentence relations. In addition, we developed an integrated pipeline to extract entities and relations together by combining RNNs and SVMs. MADEx achieved the top-three best performances (F1 score of 0.8233) for clinical NER in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE1.0) challenge. The post-challenge evaluation showed that the relation extraction module and integrated pipeline (identify entity and relation together) of MADEx are comparable with the best systems developed in this challenge. This study demonstrated the efficiency of deep learning methods for automatic extraction of medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical text to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance.",

We demonstrate the application of this method using a public open dataset on heart failure.Clinical Relevance- In order for important indicators to be clinically useful, their statistical significance must be defined.

The variation of monthly dry days from station to station could be correlated with several climatic factors. This study suggests a novel approach for predicting monthly dry days (MDD) of six target stations using different machine learning (ML) algorithms in Bangladesh. Several rainfall thresholds were used to prepare the datasets of monthly dry days (MDD) and monthly wet days (MWD). A group of ML algorithms, like Bagged Trees (BT), Exponential Gaussian Process Regression (EGPR), Matern Gaussian Process Regression (MGPR), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Fine Trees (FT) and Linear Regression (LR) were evaluated on building a competitive prediction model of MDD. In validation of the study, EGPR-based models were able to better capture the monthly dry days (MDD) over Bangladesh compared to those by MGPR, LSVM, BT, LR and FT-based models. When MDD were the predictors for all six target stations, EGPR produced highest mean R of 0.91 (min. 0.89 and max. 0.92) with a least mean RMSE of 2.14 (min. 1.78 and max. 2.69) compared to other models. An explicit evaluation of the ML algorithms using one-year lead time approach demonstrated that BT and EGPR were the most result-oriented algorithms (R = 0.78 for both models). However, having a least RMSE, EGPR was chosen as the best model in one year lead time. The dataset of monthly dry-wet days was the best predictor in the lead-time approach. In addition, sensitivity analysis demonstrated sensitivity of each station on the prediction of MDD of target stations. Monte Carlo simulation was introduced to assess the robustness of the developed models. EGPR model declared its robustness up to certain limit of randomness on the testing data. The output of this study can be referred to the agricultural sector to mitigate the impacts of dry spells on agriculture.",

    "abstract": "To maintain the serviceability of buildings, the owners need to be informed about the current condition of the water supply and waste disposal systems. Therefore, timely and accurate detection of corrosion on pipe surface is a crucial task. The conventional manual surveying process performed by human inspectors is notoriously time consuming and labor intensive. Hence, this study proposes an image processing-based method for automating the task of pipe corrosion detection. Image texture including statistical measurement of image colors, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and gray-level run length is employed to extract features of pipe surface. Support vector machine optimized by differential flower pollination is then used to construct a decision boundary that can recognize corroded and intact pipe surfaces. A dataset consisting of 2000 image samples has been collected and utilized to train and test the proposed hybrid model. Experimental results supported by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirm that the proposed method is highly suitable for the task of interest with an accuracy rate of 92.81%. Thus, the model proposed in this study can be a promising tool to assist building maintenance agents during the phase of pipe system survey.",

    "title": "Robust Brain Age Estimation Based on sMRI via Nonlinear Age-Adaptive Ensemble Learning.",
    "abstract": "Precise prediction on brain age is urgently needed by many biomedical areas including mental rehabilitation prognosis as well as various medicine or treatment trials. People began to realize that contrasting physical (real) age and predicted brain age can help to highlight brain issues and evaluate if patients' brains are healthy or not. Such age prediction is often challenging for single model-based prediction, while the conditions of brains vary drastically over age. In this work, we present an age-adaptive ensemble model that is based on the combination of four different machine learning algorithms, including a support vector machine (SVR), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the popular GoogLeNet and ResNet deep networks. The ensemble model proposed here is nonlinearly adaptive, where age is taken as a key factor in the nonlinear combination of various single-algorithm-based independent models. In our age-adaptive ensemble method, the weights of each model are learned automatically as nonlinear functions over age instead of fixed values, while brain age estimation is based on such an age-adaptive integration of various single models. The quality of the model is quantified by the mean absolute errors (MAE) and spearman correlation between the predicted age and the actual age, with the least MAE and the highest Spearman correlation representing the highest accuracy in age prediction. By testing on the Predictive Analysis Challenge 2019 (PAC 2019) dataset, our novel ensemble model has achieved a MAE down to 3.19, which is a significantly increased accuracy in this brain age competition. If deployed in the real world, our novel ensemble model having an improved accuracy could potentially help doctors to identify the risk of brain diseases more accurately and quickly, thus helping pharmaceutical companies develop drugs or treatments precisely, and potential offer a new powerful tool for researchers in the field of brain science.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning's (MLs) ability to capture intricate patterns makes it vital in neural engineering research. With its increasing use, ensuring the validity and reproducibility of ML methods is critical. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case in practice, as there have been recent retractions across various scientific fields due to the misuse of ML methods and validation procedures. To address these concerns, we propose the first version of the neural engineering reproducibility and validity essentials for ML (NERVE-ML) checklist, a framework designed to promote the transparent, reproducible, and valid application of ML in neural engineering. We highlight some of the unique challenges of model validation in neural engineering, including the difficulties from limited subject numbers, repeated or non-independent samples, and high subject heterogeneity. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how different validation approaches can lead to divergent scientific conclusions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate procedures guided by the NERVE-ML checklist. Effectively addressing these challenges and properly scoping scientific conclusions will ensure that ML contributes to, rather than hinders, progress in neural engineering. Our case studies demonstrate that improper validation approaches can result in flawed studies or overclaimed scientific conclusions, complicating the scientific discourse. The NERVE-ML checklist effectively addresses these concerns by providing guidelines to ensure that ML approaches in neural engineering are reproducible and lead to valid scientific conclusions. By effectively addressing these challenges and properly scoping scientific conclusions guided by the NERVE-ML checklist, we aim to help pave the way for a future where ML reliably enhances the quality and impact of neural engineering research.",

    "title": "Comparison of Scaling Methods to Obtain Calibrated Probabilities of Activity for Protein-Ligand Predictions.",
    "abstract": "In the context of bioactivity prediction, the question of how to calibrate a score produced by a machine learning method into a probability of binding to a protein target is not yet satisfactorily addressed. In this study, we compared the performance of three such methods, namely, Platt scaling (PS), isotonic regression (IR), and Venn-ABERS predictors (VA), in calibrating prediction scores obtained from ligand-target prediction comprising the Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, and random forest (RF) algorithms. Calibration quality was assessed on bioactivity data available at AstraZeneca for 40 million data points (compound-target pairs) across 2112 targets and performance was assessed using stratified shuffle split (SSS) and leave 20% of scaffolds out (L20SO) validation. VA achieved the best calibration performances across all machine learning algorithms and cross validation methods tested and also the lowest (best) Brier score loss (mean squared difference between the outputted probability estimates assigned to a compound and the actual outcome). In comparison, the PS and IR methods can actually degrade the assigned probability estimates, particularly for the RF for SSS and during L20SO. Sphere exclusion, a method to sample additional (putative) inactive compounds, was shown to inflate the overall Brier score loss performance, through the artificial requirement for inactive molecules to be dissimilar to active compounds, but was shown to result in overconfident estimators. VA was able to successfully calibrate the probability estimates for even small calibration sets. The multiprobability values (lower and upper probability boundary intervals) were shown to produce large discordance for test set molecules that are neither very similar nor very dissimilar to the active training set, which were hence difficult to predict, suggesting that multiprobability discordance can be used as an estimate for target prediction uncertainty. Overall, we were able to show in this work that VA scaling of target prediction models is able to improve probability estimates in all testing instances and is currently being applied for in-house approaches.",

    "title": "Radiomics and Deep Learning for Disease Detection in Musculoskeletal Radiology: An Overview of Novel MRI- and CT-Based Approaches.",
    "abstract": "Radiomics and machine learning-based methods offer exciting opportunities for improving diagnostic performance and efficiency in musculoskeletal radiology for various tasks, including acute injuries, chronic conditions, spinal abnormalities, and neoplasms. While early radiomics-based methods were often limited to a smaller number of higher-order image feature extractions, applying machine learning-based analytic models, multifactorial correlations, and classifiers now permits big data processing and testing thousands of features to identify relevant markers. A growing number of novel deep learning-based methods describe magnetic resonance imaging- and computed tomography-based algorithms for diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament tears, meniscus tears, articular cartilage defects, rotator cuff tears, fractures, metastatic skeletal disease, and soft tissue tumors. Initial radiomics and deep learning techniques have focused on binary detection tasks, such as determining the presence or absence of a single abnormality and differentiation of benign versus malignant. Newer-generation algorithms aim to include practically relevant multiclass characterization of detected abnormalities, such as typing and malignancy grading of neoplasms. So-called delta-radiomics assess tumor features before and after treatment, with temporal changes of radiomics features serving as surrogate markers for tumor responses to treatment. New approaches also predict treatment success rates, surgical resection completeness, and recurrence risk. Practice-relevant goals for the next generation of algorithms include diagnostic whole-organ and advanced classification capabilities. Important research objectives to fill current knowledge gaps include well-designed research studies to understand how diagnostic performances and suggested efficiency gains of isolated research settings translate into routine daily clinical practice. This article summarizes current radiomics- and machine learning-based magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography approaches for musculoskeletal disease detection and offers a perspective on future goals and objectives.",

The main purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal and inertial measurement units (IMUs) data to determine the optimal fusion features and classifier for the study of daily ambulation mode recognition. Methods We have carried out several steps of experiments to obtain and test the optimal combination of the sEMG data and the body motion data at the feature level and the most suitable machine learning classification algorithm. Firstly, the sEMG and IMUs signals of eighteen participants performing four different ambulatory activities have recorded using wearable sensors. Secondly, several features of the sEMG sensors and IMU data were extracted and tested by the Markov Random Field based Fisher-Markov feature selector. Finally, four ML classifiers with several feature combinations were estimated with sensitivity, precision and recognition accurate rate of ambulatory activity classification. Results The results of this work showed that all selected features were significantly statistical difference in four ambulation modes. The principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimension of selected sEMG features and IMU features to form a fusion feature input support vector machine classifier, which could predict ambulatory activities with good classification performance. Conclusions It is concluded that the results demonstrate the feasibility of the ML classification model, which could provide a more novel way to guarantee the recognition rate and effectiveness of monitor daily ambulatory activity.",

This study utilized real data collected from 2015 to 2021 through the inspection of infusion pumps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Inspections were conducted by the national laboratory in accordance with the Legal Metrology Framework, accredited to ISO 17020 standard. Out of 988 samples, 790 were used for model training, while 198 samples were set aside for validation (20% of the dataset). Various machine learning algorithms for binary classification of samples (pass/fail status) were considered, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle large datasets and potential for high prediction accuracy.ResultsThrough detailed analysis of the achieved results, it was found that all applied machine learning methods yielded satisfactory results, with accuracy ranging from 0.98% to 1.0%, precision from 0.99% to 1%, sensitivity from 0.98% to 1.0%, and specificity from 0.87% to 1.0%. However, Decision Tree and Random Forest methods proved to be the best, both due to their maximum achieved values of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, and due to result interpretability.ConclusionIt has been established that machine learning methods are capable of identifying potential issues before they become critical, thus playing a crucial role in predicting the performance of infusion pumps, potentially enhancing the safety, reliability, and efficiency of healthcare delivery.

    "abstract": "Image-based high throughput (HT) screening provides a rich source of information on dynamic cellular response to external perturbations. The large quantity of data generated necessitates computer-aided quality control (QC) methodologies to flag imaging and staining artifacts. Existing image- or patch-level QC methods require separate thresholds to be simultaneously tuned for each image quality metric used, and also struggle to distinguish between artifacts and valid cellular phenotypes. As a result, extensive time and effort must be spent on per-assay QC feature thresholding, and valid images and phenotypes may be discarded while image- and cell-level artifacts go undetected. We present a novel cell-level QC workflow built on machine learning approaches for classifying artifacts from HT image data. First, a phenotype sampler based on unlabeled clustering collects a comprehensive subset of cellular phenotypes, requiring only the inspection of a handful of images per phenotype for validity. A set of one-class support vector machines are then trained on each biologically valid image phenotype, and used to classify individual objects in each image as valid cells or artifacts. We apply this workflow to two real-world large-scale HT image datasets and observe that the ratio of artifact to total object area (AR ) provides a single robust assessment of image quality regardless of the underlying causes of quality issues. Gating on this single intuitive metric, partially contaminated images can be salvaged and highly contaminated images can be excluded before image-level phenotype summary, enabling a more reliable characterization of cellular response dynamics. Our cell-level QC workflow enables identification of artificial cells created not only by staining or imaging artifacts but also by the limitations of image segmentation algorithms. The single readout AR that summaries the ratio of artifacts contained in each image can be used to reliably rank images by quality and more accurately determine QC cutoff thresholds. Machine learning-based cellular phenotype clustering and sampling reduces the amount of manual work required for training example collection. Our QC workflow automatically handles assay-specific phenotypic variations and generalizes to different HT image assays.",

However, the practical application of such a classification approach is restricted by the scarcity of labeled freshwater algae datasets, especially for rarer algae. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes to generate artificial algal images with StyleGAN2-ADA and use both the generated and real images to train machine-learning-driven algae classification models. This approach significantly enhances the performance of classification models, particularly in their ability to identify rare algae. Overall, the proposed approach improves the F1-score of lightweight MobileNetV3 classification models covering all 20 freshwater algae covered in this research from 88.4% to 96.2%, while for the models that cover only the rarer algae, the experiments show an improvement from 80% to 96.5% in terms of F1-score. The results show that the approach enables the trained algae classification systems to effectively cover algae with limited image data.",

We developed the Computer-Aided Note and Diagnosis Interface (CANDI) for collaboratively annotating radiographs and evaluating how algorithms alter human interpretation.

    "title": "Unsupervised SoftOtsuNet Augmentation for Clinical Dermatology Image Classifiers.",
    "abstract": "Data Augmentation is a crucial tool in the Machine Learning (ML) toolbox because it can extract novel, useful training images from an existing dataset, thereby improving accuracy and reducing overfitting in a Deep Neural Network (DNNs). However, clinical dermatology images often contain irrelevant background information,such as furniture and objects in the frame. DNNs make use of that information when optimizing the loss function. Data augmentation methods that preserve this information risk creating biases in the DNN's understanding (for example, that objects in a particular doctor's office are a clue that the patient has cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). Creating a supervised foreground/background segmentation algorithm for clinical dermatology images that removes this irrelevant information would be prohibitively expensive due to labeling costs. To that end, we propose a novel unsupervised DNN that dynamically masks out image information based on a combination of a differentiable adaptation of Otsu's Method and CutOut augmentation. SoftOtsuNet augmentation outperforms all other evaluated augmentation methods on the Fitzpatrick17k dataset ( improvement), Diverse Dermatology Images dataset ( improvement), and our proprietary dataset ( improvement). SoftOtsuNet is only required at training time, meaning inference costs are unchanged from the baseline. This further suggests that even large data-driven models can still benefit from human-engineered unsupervised loss functions.",

    "title": "Lightweight Multi-Class Support Vector Machine-Based Medical Diagnosis System with Privacy Preservation.",
    "abstract": "Machine learning, powered by cloud servers, has found application in medical diagnosis, enhancing the capabilities of smart healthcare services. Research literature demonstrates that the support vector machine (SVM) consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy in medical diagnosis. Nonetheless, safeguarding patients' health data privacy and preserving the intellectual property of diagnosis models is of paramount importance. This concern arises from the common practice of outsourcing these models to third-party cloud servers that may not be entirely trustworthy. Few studies in the literature have delved into addressing these issues within SVM-based diagnosis systems. These studies, however, typically demand substantial communication and computational resources and may fail to conceal classification results and protect model intellectual property. This paper aims to tackle these limitations within a multi-class SVM medical diagnosis system. To achieve this, we have introduced modifications to an inner product encryption cryptosystem and incorporated it into our medical diagnosis framework. Notably, our cryptosystem proves to be more efficient than the Paillier and multi-party computation cryptography methods employed in previous research. Although we focus on a medical application in this paper, our approach can also be used for other applications that need the evaluation of machine learning models in a privacy-preserving way such as electricity theft detection in the smart grid, electric vehicle charging coordination, and vehicular social networks. To assess the performance and security of our approach, we conducted comprehensive analyses and experiments. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed method successfully fulfills our security and privacy objectives while maintaining high classification accuracy and minimizing communication and computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of atomic partial charges with high-level quantum mechanics (QM) methods suffers from high computational cost. Numerous feature-engineered machine learning (ML)-based predictors with favorable computability and reliability have been developed as alternatives. However, extensive expertise effort was needed for feature engineering of atom chemical environment, which may consequently introduce domain bias. In this study, SuperAtomicCharge, a data-driven deep graph learning framework, was proposed to predict three important types of partial charges (i.e. RESP, DDEC4 and DDEC78) derived from high-level QM calculations based on the structures of molecules. SuperAtomicCharge was designed to simultaneously exploit the 2D and 3D structural information of molecules, which was proved to be an effective way to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Moreover, a simple transfer learning strategy and a multitask learning strategy based on self-supervised descriptors were also employed to further improve the prediction accuracy of the proposed model. Compared with the latest baselines, including one GNN-based predictor and two ML-based predictors, SuperAtomicCharge showed better performance on all the three external test sets and had better usability and portability. Furthermore, the QM partial charges of new molecules predicted by SuperAtomicCharge can be efficiently used in drug design applications such as structure-based virtual screening, where the predicted RESP and DDEC4 charges of new molecules showed more robust scoring and screening power than the commonly used partial charges. Finally, two tools including an online server (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/deepchargepredictor) and the source code command lines (https://github.com/zjujdj/SuperAtomicCharge) were developed for the easy access of the SuperAtomicCharge services.",

    "abstract": "Breast diseases are a group of diseases that appear in different forms. An entire group of these diseases is breast cancer. This disease is one of the most important and common diseases in women. A machine learning system has been trained to identify specific patterns using an algorithm in a machine learning system to diagnose breast cancer. Therefore, designing a feature extraction method is essential to decrease the computation time. In this article, a two-dimensional contourlet is utilized as the input image based on the Breast Cancer Ultrasound Dataset. The sub-banded contourlet coefficients are modeled using the time-dependent model. The features of the time-dependent model are considered the leading property vector. The extracted features are applied separately to determine breast cancer classes based on classification methods. The classification is performed for the diagnosis of tumor types. We used the time-dependent approach to feature contourlet sub-bands from three groups of benign, malignant, and health control test samples. The final feature of 1200 ultrasound images used in three categories is trained based on -nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and linear discrimination analysis approaches, and the results are recorded. The decision tree results show that the method's sensitivity is 87.8%, 92.0%, and 87.0% for normal, benign, and malignant, respectively. The presented feature extraction method is compatible with the decision tree approach for this problem. Based on the results, the decision tree architecture with the highest accuracy is the more accurate and compatible method for diagnosing breast cancer using ultrasound images.",

    "abstract": "Near infrared spectroscopy coupled with predictive modeling is a growing field of study for addressing questions in wildlife science aimed at improving management strategies and conservation outcomes for managed and threatened fauna. To date, the majority of spectroscopic studies in wildlife and fisheries applied chemometrics and predictive modeling with a single-algorithm approach. By contrast, multi-model approaches are used routinely for analyzing spectroscopic datasets across many major industries (e.g., medicine, agriculture) to maximize predictive outcomes for real-world applications. In this study, we conducted a benchmark modeling exercise to compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms in a multi-class problem utilizing a multivariate spectroscopic dataset obtained from live animals. Spectra obtained from live individuals representing eleven amphibian species were classified according to taxonomic designation. Seven modeling techniques were applied to generate prediction models, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) with regard to mean classification accuracy (e.g., support vector machine: 95.8 ± 0.8% vs. K-nearest neighbors: 89.3 ± 1.0%). Through the use of a multi-algorithm approach, candidate algorithms can be identified and applied to more effectively model complex spectroscopic data collected for wildlife sciences. Other key considerations in the predictive modeling workflow that serve to optimize spectroscopic model performance (e.g., variable selection and cross-validation procedures) are also discussed.",

This study aims to develop a verifiable and interpretable machine learning model to identify ADHD and its subtypes in children using clinical assessment scales data. This study utilized the ADHD-200 dataset, including demographic data, Behavioral Rating Scale, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale assessments, to train and validate our models. The model's performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation within the internal dataset, and the best model will be used for external validation. Seven machine learning models were evaluated. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed for model interpretation. Finally, a web application will deploy the prediction model to provide ADHD probabilities based on user input. The Random Forest (RF) model performing best in identifying ADHD and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model excelling in distinguishing ADHD subtypes. The RF model achieved an AUC of 0.99 in 10-fold cross-validation and an AUC of 0.99 in external validation, and the SVM model achieved a micro-average AUC of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.83 in internal validation and a micro-average AUC of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.85 in external validation. We used SHAP to interpret the models, revealing that higher ADHD Index pushed the model towards ADHD classification. Additionally, lower IQ scores were correlated with a higher likelihood of ADHD, consistent with previous studies. The dependency analysis found that the model can identify different behavioral scales. We deployed the final model online using a web application and showed users how the model made decisions. Our findings highlight the potential of using machine learning and clinical assessment scales to support the diagnosis and subtype identification of ADHD in children, offering a practical solution for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.",

To address aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a multichannel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for automated biomedical relation extraction. The proposed model has the following two contributions: (1) it enables the fusion of multiple (e.g., five) versions in word embeddings; (2) the need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning with convolutional neural network (CNN).

    "title": "An Intelligent System for Classifying Patient Complaints Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing: Development and Validation Study.",
    "abstract": "Accurate classification of patient complaints is crucial for enhancing patient satisfaction management in health care settings. Traditional manual methods for categorizing complaints often lack efficiency and precision. Thus, there is a growing demand for advanced and automated approaches to streamline the classification process. This study aimed to develop and validate an intelligent system for automatically classifying patient complaints using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. An ML-based NLP technology was proposed to extract frequently occurring dissatisfactory words related to departments, staff, and key treatment procedures. A dataset containing 1465 complaint records from 2019 to 2023 was used for training and validation, with an additional 376 complaints from Hangzhou Cancer Hospital serving as an external test set. Complaints were categorized into 4 types-communication problems, diagnosis and treatment issues, management problems, and sense of responsibility concerns. The imbalanced data were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm to ensure equal representation across all categories. A total of 3 ML algorithms (Multifactor Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines [SVM]) were used for model training and validation. The best-performing model was tested using a 5-fold cross-validation on external data. The original dataset consisted of 719, 376, 260, and 86 records for communication problems, diagnosis and treatment issues, management problems, and sense of responsibility concerns, respectively. The Multifactor Logistic Regression and SVM models achieved weighted average accuracies of 0.89 and 0.93 in the training set, and 0.83 and 0.87 in the internal test set, respectively. Ngram-level term frequency-inverse document frequency did not significantly improve classification performance, with only a marginal 1% increase in precision, recall, and F -score when implementing Ngram-level term frequency-inverse document frequency (n=2) from 0.91 to 0.92. The SVM algorithm performed best in prediction, achieving an average accuracy of 0.91 on the external test set with a 95% CI of 0.87-0.97. The NLP-driven SVM algorithm demonstrates effective classification performance in automatically categorizing patient complaint texts. It showed superior performance in both internal and external test sets for communication and management problems. However, caution is advised when using it for classifying sense of responsibility complaints. This approach holds promises for implementation in medical institutions with high complaint volumes and limited resources for addressing patient feedback.",

In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, Deep DNAshape, that fundamentally changes the current k-mer based high-throughput prediction of DNA shape features by accurately accounting for the influence of extended flanking regions, without the need for extensive molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. By using the Deep DNAshape method, DNA structural features can be predicted for any length and number of DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner, providing an understanding of the effects of flanking regions on DNA structure in a target region of a sequence. The Deep DNAshape method provides access to the influence of distant flanking regions on a region of interest. Our findings reveal that DNA shape readout mechanisms of a core target are quantitatively affected by flanking regions, including extended flanking regions, providing valuable insights into the detailed structural readout mechanisms of protein-DNA binding. Furthermore, when incorporated in machine learning models, the features generated by Deep DNAshape improve the model prediction accuracy.

This study presents a novel approach combining graph-based data representation with DARTS-optimised MobileViT models, with the objective of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reliability. The images of the pancreatic CT were transformed into graph structures using the Harris Corner Detection algorithm, which enables the capture of complex spatial relationships. Subsequently, the graph representations were processed using MobileViT models that had been optimised with Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), thereby enabling dynamic architectural adaptation. To further enhance classification accuracy, advanced machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, were applied. The MobileViTv2_150 and MobileViTv2_200 models demonstrated remarkable performance, with an accuracy of 97.33% and an F1 score of 96.25%, surpassing the capabilities of traditional CNN and Vision Transformer models. This innovative integration of graph-based deep learning and machine learning techniques demonstrates the potential of the proposed method to establish a new standard for early pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

The voices of people with Parkinson's disease may become weak, breathy, or hoarse and may sound emotionless, with slurred words and mumbling. Algorithms for computerized voice analysis have been proposed and have shown highly accurate results. However, these algorithms were developed on single, limited datasets, with participants possessing similar demographics. Such models are prone to overfitting and are unsuitable for generalization, which is essential in real-world applications. We evaluated the computerized Parkinson's disease diagnosis performance of various machine learning models and showed that these models degraded rapidly when used on different datasets. We evaluated two mainstream state-of-the-art approaches, one based on deep convolutional neural networks and another based on voice feature extraction followed by a shallow classifier (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). An investigation with four datasets (CzechPD, PC-GITA, ITA, and RMIT-PD) proved that even if the algorithms yielded excellent performance on a single dataset, the results obtained on new data or even a mix of datasets were very unsatisfactory. More work needs to be done to make computerized voice analysis methods for Parkinson's disease diagnosis suitable for real-world applications.",

Propaganda on these platforms refers to the dissemination of biased or deceptive information aimed at influencing public opinion, encompassing various forms such as political campaigns, fake news, and conspiracy theories. This study introduces a Hybrid Feature Engineering Approach for Propaganda Identification (HAPI), designed to detect propaganda in text-based content like news articles and social media posts. HAPI combines conventional feature engineering methods with machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in propaganda detection. This study is conducted on data collected from Twitter via its API, and an annotation scheme is proposed to categorize tweets into binary classes (propaganda and non-propaganda). Hybrid feature engineering entails the amalgamation of various features, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Bag of Words (BoW), Sentimental features, and tweet length, among others. Multiple Machine Learning classifiers undergo training and evaluation utilizing the proposed methodology, leveraging a selection of 40 pertinent features identified through the hybrid feature selection technique. All the selected algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR) achieved promising results. The SVM-based HaPi (SVM-HaPi) exhibits superior performance among traditional algorithms, achieving precision, recall, F-Measure, and overall accuracy of 0.69, 0.69, 0.69, and 69.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared to well-known existing approaches where it overperformed most of the studies on several evaluation metrics. This research contributes to the development of a comprehensive system tailored for propaganda identification in textual content. Nonetheless, the purview of propaganda detection transcends textual data alone. Deep learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) offer the capability to manage multimodal data, incorporating text, images, audio, and video, thereby considering not only the content itself but also its presentation and contextual nuances during dissemination.",

    "title": "Deep learning applications in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics data analysis.",
    "abstract": "Traditional bulk sequencing methods are limited to measuring the average signal in a group of cells, potentially masking heterogeneity, and rare populations. The single-cell resolution, however, enhances our understanding of complex biological systems and diseases, such as cancer, the immune system, and chronic diseases. However, the single-cell technologies generate massive amounts of data that are often high-dimensional, sparse, and complex, thus making analysis with traditional computational approaches difficult and unfeasible. To tackle these challenges, many are turning to deep learning (DL) methods as potential alternatives to the conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms for single-cell studies. DL is a branch of ML capable of extracting high-level features from raw inputs in multiple stages. Compared to traditional ML, DL models have provided significant improvements across many domains and applications. In this work, we examine DL applications in genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, and address whether DL techniques will prove to be advantageous or if the single-cell omics domain poses unique challenges. Through a systematic literature review, we have found that DL has not yet revolutionized the most pressing challenges of the single-cell omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) in data preprocessing and downstream analysis. Although developments of DL algorithms for single-cell omics have generally been gradual, recent advances reveal that DL can offer valuable resources in fast-tracking and advancing research in single-cell.",

    "title": "Semi-supervised Learning for Generalizable Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection and Segmentation.",
    "abstract": "Purpose To develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning model for intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation on an out-of-distribution head CT evaluation set. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used semi-supervised learning to bootstrap performance. An initial \"teacher\" deep learning model was trained on 457 pixel-labeled head CT scans collected from one U.S. institution from 2010 to 2017 and used to generate pseudo labels on a separate unlabeled corpus of 25 000 examinations from the Radiological Society of North America and American Society of Neuroradiology. A second \"student\" model was trained on this combined pixel- and pseudo-labeled dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on a validation set of 93 scans. Testing for both classification ( = 481 examinations) and segmentation ( = 23 examinations, or 529 images) was performed on CQ500, a dataset of 481 scans performed in India, to evaluate out-of-distribution generalizability. The semi-supervised model was compared with a baseline model trained on only labeled data using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Dice similarity coefficient, and average precision metrics. Results The semi-supervised model achieved a statistically significant higher examination area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on CQ500 compared with the baseline (0.939 [95% CI: 0.938, 0.940] vs 0.907 [95% CI: 0.906, 0.908]; = .009). It also achieved a higher Dice similarity coefficient (0.829 [95% CI: 0.825, 0.833] vs 0.809 [95% CI: 0.803, 0.812]; = .012) and pixel average precision (0.848 [95% CI: 0.843, 0.853]) vs 0.828 [95% CI: 0.817, 0.828]) compared with the baseline. Conclusion The addition of unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning framework demonstrates stronger generalizability potential for intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation compared with a supervised baseline.

    "title": "An integrated approach of feature selection and machine learning for early detection of breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers in women globally, with its treatment efficacy heavily reliant on the early identification and diagnosis of the disease. The importance of early detection and diagnosis cannot be overstated in enhancing the survival prospects of those afflicted with breast cancer. With the increasing application of machine learning technology in the medical field, algorithm-based diagnostic tools provide new possibilities for early prediction of breast cancer. In this study, we introduced a novel feature selection approach, which leverages Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values as the basis for Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), utilizing a Random Forest (RF) algorithm within the RFE framework. To address the data imbalance challenge, we incorporated Borderline-SMOTE1. The efficacy of the proposed method was assessed using five machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis (WBCD) datasets. Optimizing hyperparameters of five models using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the datasets, 26 features were filtered using our recommended algorithm, the LightGBM-PSO model demonstrated an outstanding performance. The model demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 99.0% in differentiating between benign and malignant cases, boasting a specificity and precision of 100%, a recall rate of 97.40%, an F-measure of 98.68%, an AUC of 0.9870, and a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.9808. Subsequently, we developed a corresponding online tool (https://breast-cancer-prediction-tool-cgbjlhkns7yig6bmzvztmc.streamlit.app/) based on this model for predicting the risk of breast cancer. Feature selection using recommended algorithm and optimization of the LightGBM model through PSO can significantly enhance the accuracy of breast cancer prediction. This could potentially improve the prognosis for patients diagnosed with breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "In the quest to understand how structure and dynamics are connected in glasses, a number of machine learning based methods have been developed that predict dynamics in supercooled liquids. These methods include both increasingly complex machine learning techniques and increasingly sophisticated descriptors used to describe the environment around particles. In many cases, both the chosen machine learning technique and choice of structural descriptors are varied simultaneously, making it hard to quantitatively compare the performance of different machine learning approaches. Here, we use three different machine learning algorithms-linear regression, neural networks, and graph neural networks-to predict the dynamic propensity of a glassy binary hard-sphere mixture using as structural input a recursive set of order parameters recently introduced by Boattini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 088007 (2021)]. As we show, when these advanced descriptors are used, all three methods predict the dynamics with nearly equal accuracy.

Several gRNA activity and specificity predicting models and web tools have been developed, making it much more convenient and precise for conducting CRISPR gene editing studies. In this review, we present an overview and comparative analysis of machine and deep learning (MDL)-based algorithms, which are believed to be the most effective and reliable methods for the prediction of CRISPR gRNA on- and off-target activities. As an increasing number of sequence features and characteristics are discovered and are incorporated into the MDL models, the prediction outcome is getting closer to experimental observations.

    "title": "Hybrid Deep-Learning and Machine-Learning Models for Predicting COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public life and health worldwide, putting the world's healthcare systems at risk. The first step in stopping this outbreak is to detect the infection in its early stages, which will relieve the risk, control the outbreak's spread, and restore full functionality to the world's healthcare systems. Currently, PCR is the most prevalent diagnosis tool for COVID-19. However, chest X-ray images may play an essential role in detecting this disease, as they are successful for many other viral pneumonia diseases. Unfortunately, there are common features between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia, and hence manual differentiation between them seems to be a critical problem and needs the aid of artificial intelligence. This research employs deep- and transfer-learning techniques to develop accurate, general, and robust models for detecting COVID-19. The developed models utilize either convolutional neural networks or transfer-learning models or hybridize them with powerful machine-learning techniques to exploit their full potential. For experimentation, we applied the proposed models to two data sets: the COVID-19 Radiography Database from Kaggle and a local data set from Asir Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia. The proposed models achieved promising results in detecting COVID-19 cases and discriminating them from normal and other viral pneumonia with excellent accuracy. The hybrid models extracted features from the flatten layer or the first hidden layer of the neural network and then fed these features into a classification algorithm. This approach enhanced the results further to full accuracy for binary COVID-19 classification and 97.8% for multiclass classification.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop radiomics models for predicting the evolution of unenhanced MS lesions by using different kinds of machine learning algorithms and explore the optimal model. In this prospective observation, 45 follow-up MR images obtained in 36 patients with MS (mean age 32.53±10.91; 23 women, 13 men) were evaluated. The lesions will be defined as interval activity and interval inactivity, respectively, based on the percentage of enlargement or reduction of the lesion >20% in the follow-up MR images. We extracted radiomic features of lesions on FLAIR images, and used recursive feature elimination (RFE), ReliefF algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for feature selection, then three classification models including logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) were used to build predictive models. The performance of the models were evaluated based on the sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value (NPV) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curves analyses. 135 interval inactivity lesions and 110 interval activity lesions were registered in our study. A total of 972 radiomics features were extracted, of which 265 were robust. The consistency and effectiveness of model performance were compared and verified by different combinations of feature selection and machine learning methods in different K-fold cross-validation strategies where K ranges from 5 to 10, thus demonstrating the stability and robustness. SVM classifier with ReliefF algorithm had the best prediction performance with an average accuracy of 0.827, sensitivity of 0.809, specificity of 0.841, precision of 0.921, NPV of 0.948 and the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.812-0.902) in the cohorts.

    "abstract": "Dental disorders are common worldwide, causing pain or infections and limiting mouth opening, so dental conditions impact productivity, work capability, and quality of life. Manual detection and classification of oral diseases is time-consuming and requires dentists' evaluation and examination. The dental disease detection and classification system based on machine learning and deep learning will aid in early dental disease diagnosis. Hence, this paper proposes a new diagnosis system for dental diseases using X-ray imaging. The framework includes a robust pre-processing phase that uses image normalization and adaptive histogram equalization to improve image quality and reduce variation. A dual-stream approach is used for feature extraction, utilizing the advantages of Swin Transformer for capturing long-range dependencies and global context and MobileNetV2 for effective local feature extraction. A thorough representation of dental anomalies is produced by fusing the extracted features. To obtain reliable and broadly applicable classification results, a bagging ensemble classifier is utilized in the end. We evaluate our model on a benchmark dental radiography dataset. The experimental results and comparisons show the superiority of the proposed system with 95.7% for precision, 95.4% for sensitivity, 95.7% for specificity, 95.5% for Dice similarity coefficient, and 95.6% for accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid model integrating MoileNetv2 and Swin Transformer architectures, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in classifying dental diseases using dental panoramic X-ray imaging. This framework presents a promising method for robustly and accurately diagnosing dental diseases automatically, which may help dentists plan treatments and identify dental diseases early on.",

Compared to previous method based on \"bag of words\" (BOW) model, this study uniquely identifies the enrichment protocol and learns how semantically different aspects of feature selection such as BOW (feature F0), term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF, feature F1), and latent semantic indexing (LSI, feature F2) when applied sequentially with classifier improves the overall performance. To study this enrichment concept, our ML model is tested on two kinds of diverse data sets: (i) D1: Disease data with conjunctivitis, diarrhea, stomach ache, cough and nausea related tweets, and (ii) D2: WebKB4 dataset, while adapting three kind of classifiers (a) C1: support vector machine with radial basis function (SVMR), (b) C2: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and (c) C3: Random Forest (RF). Partition protocol (K10) was adapted with different performance metrics to evaluate machine learning (ML)-system. Using the combination of F1, C1, D1, K10, ML accuracy was: 94%, while with F2, C1, D1, K10, ML accuracy was 97%. Using the incremental feature enrichment from F0 to F2, K10 protocol gave F1 improvement over F0 by 4.98% on Disease dataset, while F2 improvement over F0 was by 11.78% on WebKB4 dataset. We demonstrated the generalization over memorization process in our ML-design. The system was tested for stability and reliability. We conclude that semantically different aspects of feature selection, when adapted sequentially, leads to improvement in ML-accuracy for healthcare data sets.

Although a cure remains elusive, symptom management through medication is possible. Timely detection is pivotal for effective disease management. In this study, we leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) models, to differentiate between individuals with PD and healthy individuals based on voice signal characteristics. Our dataset, sourced from the University of California at Irvine (UCI), comprises 195 voice recordings collected from 31 patients. To optimize model performance, we employ various strategies including Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for addressing class imbalance, Feature Selection to identify the most relevant features, and hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. Our experimentation reveals that the FNN and KSVM models, trained on an 80-20 split of the dataset for training and testing respectively, yield the most promising results. The FNN model achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 99.11%, with 98.78% recall, 99.96% precision, and a 99.23% f1-score. Similarly, the KSVM model demonstrates strong performance with an overall accuracy of 95.89%, recall of 96.88%, precision of 98.71%, and an f1-score of 97.62%. Overall, our study showcases the efficacy of ML and DL techniques in accurately identifying PD from voice signals, underscoring the potential for these approaches to contribute significantly to early diagnosis and intervention strategies for Parkinson's Disease.",

However, the long-term DO change in global lakes remains unknown due to limited available data. To address this gap, we integrate Landsat data and geographic features to develop DO estimation models for global lakes using machine learning approaches. The results demonstrated that the trained random forest (RF) model has better performance (R = 0.72, and RMSE = 1.24 mg/L) than artificial neural network (ANN) (R = 0.66, and RMSE = 1.39 mg/L), support vector machine regression (SVR) (R = 0.62, and RMSE = 1.45 mg/L) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) (R = 0.72, and RMSE = 1.29 mg/L). Then, we used the trained RF model to reveal the DO long-term (1984-2021) change in surface water (epilimnetic) of 351,236 global lakes with water area ≥ 0.1 km . The results show that the average epilimnetic DO concentration of global lake was 9.72 ± 1.07 mg/L, with higher DO in the polar regions (latitude > 66.56 °) (10.87 ± 0.54 mg/L) and lower in the equatorial regions (-5 ° < latitude < 5 °) (6.29 ± 0.63 mg/L). We also find widespread deoxygenation in surface water of global lakes, with a rate of - 0.036 mg/L per decade. Meanwhile, the number of lakes and surface area that experiencing DO stress are continuously increasing, with rate of 39 and 212.85 km , respectively. Our results offer a comprehensive dataset of DO variation spanning nearly 40 years, furnishing valuable insights for formulating effective management strategies, and enhancing the maintenance of the health of aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play a significant role in all phases of genetic processes, including DNA recombination, repair, and modification. They are often utilized in drug discovery as fundamental elements of steroids, antibiotics, and anticancer drugs. Predicting them poses the most challenging task in proteomics research. Conventional experimental methods for DBP identification are costly and sometimes biased toward prediction. Therefore, developing powerful computational methods that can accurately and rapidly identify DBPs from sequence information is an urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based method called Deep-WET to accurately identify DBPs from primary sequence information. In Deep-WET, we employed three powerful feature encoding schemes containing Global Vectors, Word2Vec, and fastText to encode the protein sequence. Subsequently, these three features were sequentially combined and weighted using the weights obtained from the elements learned through the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. To enhance the predictive performance of Deep-WET, we applied the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach to remove irrelevant features. Finally, the optimal feature subset was input into convolutional neural networks to construct the Deep-WET predictor. Both cross-validation and independent tests indicated that Deep-WET achieved superior predictive performance compared to conventional machine learning classifiers. In addition, in extensive independent test, Deep-WET was effective and outperformed than several state-of-the-art methods for DBP prediction, with accuracy of 78.08%, MCC of 0.559, and AUC of 0.805. This superior performance shows that Deep-WET has a tremendous predictive capacity to predict DBPs. The web server of Deep-WET and curated datasets in this study are available at https://deepwet-dna.monarcatechnical.com/ . The proposed Deep-WET is anticipated to serve the community-wide effort for large-scale identification of potential DBPs.",

    "title": "An Explainable Machine Learning Model for Material Backorder Prediction in Inventory Management.",
    "abstract": "Global competition among businesses imposes a more effective and low-cost supply chain allowing firms to provide products at a desired quality, quantity, and time, with lower production costs. The latter include holding cost, ordering cost, and backorder cost. Backorder occurs when a product is temporarily unavailable or out of stock and the customer places an order for future production and shipment. Therefore, stock unavailability and prolonged delays in product delivery will lead to additional production costs and unsatisfied customers, respectively. Thus, it is of high importance to develop models that will effectively predict the backorder rate in an inventory system with the aim of improving the effectiveness of the supply chain and, consequentially, the performance of the company. However, traditional approaches in the literature are based on stochastic approximation, without incorporating information from historical data. To this end, machine learning models should be employed for extracting knowledge of large historical data to develop predictive models. Therefore, to cover this need, in this study, the backorder prediction problem was addressed. Specifically, various machine learning models were compared for solving the binary classification problem of backorder prediction, followed by model calibration and a post-hoc explainability based on the SHAP model to identify and interpret the most important features that contribute to material backorder. The results showed that the RF, XGB, LGBM, and BB models reached an AUC score of 0.95, while the best-performing model was the LGBM model after calibration with the Isotonic Regression method. The explainability analysis showed that the inventory stock of a product, the volume of products that can be delivered, the imminent demand (sales), and the accurate prediction of the future demand can significantly contribute to the correct prediction of backorders.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which results in millions of deaths in the human population worldwide each year. It is therefore considered a major global health issue with a massive disease burden. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of malaria is important for treatment. Rapid diagnosis of this disease will be very valuable for patients, as traditional methods require tedious work for its detection. The aim of the study is to classify malaria cell images using machine learning and deep learning methods. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) database was used for malaria cell images classification as infected and uninfected, with a total of 27,558 malaria cell images used in the experimental study. Additionally, the training option parameters (initial learning rate, L2 regularization, and momentum values) of the Residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were optimized using the Bayesian method. In the study, Residual CNN, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the malaria cell images. Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) were observed to increase the performance of classifiers used in the classification of malaria cell images. The Accuracy (Acc), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Spe), and F-score were used as the performance metrics for the classifier performances. The best classification results were achieved with SVM (Acc 99.90%, Se 99.98%, Spe 87.50%, and F-Score 99.90%). As a result, a high level of classification performance was achieved from creating a hybrid model with Bayesian optimization and Deep Residual CNN features.",

This research focuses on predicting slow connections that create bottlenecks in distributed workflows. In this study, we analyze network traffic logs collected between January 2021 and August 2022 at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). Based on the observed patterns, we define a set of features primarily based on history for identifying low-performing data transfers. Typically, there are far fewer slow connections on well-maintained networks, which creates difficulty in learning to identify these abnormally slow connections from the normal ones. We devise several stratified sampling techniques to address the class-imbalance challenge and study how they affect the machine learning approaches. Our tests show that a relatively simple technique that undersamples the normal cases to balance the number of samples in two classes (normal and slow) is very effective for model training. This model predicts slow connections with an F1 score of 0.926.",

Naturally, there have been ongoing endeavors in adopting these techniques to the chemical domain, resulting in a surge of publications within a short period. The diversity of chemical structures, use cases, and learning models necessitate a comprehensive summarization of existing works. In this paper, we review recent innovations in adapting transformers to solve learning problems in chemistry. Because chemical data is diverse and complex, we structure our discussion based on chemical representations. Specifically, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each representation, the current progress of adapting transformer architectures, and future directions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel methodology based on machine learning for identifying the most appropriate from a set of available state-of-the-art object detectors for a given application. Our particular interest is to develop a road map for identifying verifiably optimal selections, especially for challenging applications such as detecting small objects in a mixed-size object dataset. State-of-the-art object detection systems often find the localisation of small-size objects challenging since most are usually trained on large-size objects. These contain abundant information as they occupy a large number of pixels relative to the total image size. This fact is normally exploited by the model during training and inference processes. To dissect and understand this process, our approach systematically examines detectors' performances using two very distinct deep convolutional networks. The first is the single-stage YOLO V3 and the second is the double-stage Faster R-CNN. Specifically, our proposed method explores and visually illustrates the impact of feature extraction layers, number of anchor boxes, data augmentation, etc., utilising ideas from the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Our results, for example, show that multi-head YOLO V3 detectors trained using augmented data produce better performance even with a fewer number of anchor boxes. Moreover, robustness regarding the detector's ability to explain how a specific decision was reached is investigated using different explanation techniques. Finally, two new visualisation techniques are proposed, WS-Grad and Concat-Grad, for identifying explanation cues of different detectors. These are applied to specific object detection tasks to illustrate their reliability and transparency with respect to the decision process. It is shown that the proposed techniques can result in high resolution and comprehensive heatmaps of the image areas, significantly affecting detector decisions as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques tested.",

    "title": "Spatial Modeling of Maritime Risk Using Machine Learning.",
    "abstract": "Managing navigational safety is a key responsibility of coastal states. Predicting and measuring these risks has a high complexity due to their infrequent occurrence, multitude of causes, and large study areas. As a result, maritime risk models are generally limited in scale to small regions, generalized across diverse environments, or rely on the use of expert judgement. Therefore, such an approach has limited scalability and may incorrectly characterize the risk. Within this article a novel method for undertaking spatial modeling of maritime risk is proposed through machine learning. This enables navigational safety to be characterized while leveraging the significant volumes of relevant data available. The method comprises two key components: aggregation of historical accident data, vessel traffic, and other exploratory features into a spatial grid; and the implementation of several classification algorithms that predicts annual accident occurrence for various vessel types. This approach is applied to characterize the risk of collisions and groundings in the United Kingdom. The results vary between hazard types and vessel types but show remarkable capability at characterizing maritime risk, with accuracies and area under curve scores in excess of 90% in most implementations. Furthermore, the ensemble tree-based algorithms of XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperformed other machine learning algorithms that were tested. The resultant potential risk maps provide decisionmakers with actionable intelligence in order to target risk mitigation measures in regions with the greatest requirement.",

These efforts have demonstrated not only improved performance and generalizability in these aforementioned tasks but also application to novel clinical scenarios.

To improve the quality of low-intensity images and identify the leukemia classification by utilizing CNN-based Deep Learning (DCNN) strategy. The strategies employed for the recognition of leukemia classifications in the advised strategy are DCNN (ResNet-34 & DenseNet-121). The histogram equalization-based adaptive gamma correction followed by guided filtering applies to study the improvement in intensity and preserve the essential details of the image. The DCNN is used as a feature extractor to help classify leukemia types. Two datasets of ASH with 520 images and ALL-IDB with 559 images are used in this study. In 1,079 images, 779 are positive cases depicting leukemia and 300 images are negative (normal) cases. Thus, to validate performance of this DCNN strategy, ASH and ALL-IDB datasets are promoted in the investigation process to classify between positive and negative images. The DCNN classifier yieldes the overall classification accuracy of 99.2% and 98.4%, respectively. In addition, the achieved classification specificity, sensitivity, and precision are 99.3%, 98.7%, 98.4%, and 98.9%, 98.4%,98.6% applying to two datasets, respectively, which are higher than the performance using other machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, decision tree, naive bayes, random forest and VGG-16.

    "title": "Using Item Response Theory for Explainable Machine Learning in Predicting Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: Case-Based Approach.",
    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (ML) is being featured in the health care literature with study results frequently reported using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, or F1 score. Although each metric provides a different perspective on the performance, they remain to be overall measures for the whole sample, discounting the uniqueness of each case or patient. Intuitively, we know that all cases are not equal, but the present evaluative approaches do not take case difficulty into account. A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar value. Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the interaction between them in predicting accuracy. The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison. This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Zhejiang Suichang native honey, which is included in the list of China's National Geographical Indication Agricultural Products Protection Project, is very popular. This study proposes a method of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms to accurately detect low-concentration adulterated Suichang native honey. In this study, the native honey collected by local beekeepers in Suichang was selected for adulteration detection. The spectral data was compressed by Savitzky-Golay smoothing and partial least squares (PLS) in sequence. The PLS features taken for further analysis were selected according to the contribution rate. In this study, three classification modeling methods including support vector machine, probabilistic neural network and convolutional neural network were adopted to correctly classify pure and adulterated honey samples. The total accuracy was 100%, 100% and 99.75% respectively. The research result shows that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential in accurately detecting adulteration of low-concentration honey.",

    "abstract": "In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), speech emotion recognition technology plays an important role. Facing a small number of speech emotion data, a novel speech emotion recognition method based on feature construction and ensemble learning is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the acoustic features are extracted from the speech signal and combined to form different original feature sets. Secondly, based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) method, a novel feature selection method named L-SFS is proposed. And then, the softmax regression model is used to learn automatically the weights of the four single weak learners including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and LightGBM. Lastly, based on the learned automatically weights and the weighted average probability voting strategy, an ensemble classification model named Sklex is constructed, which integrates the above four single weak learners. In conclusion, the method reflects the effectiveness of feature construction and the superiority and stability of ensemble learning, and gets good speech emotion recognition accuracy.",

    "title": "IoT-Enabled Framework for Early Detection and Prediction of COVID-19 Suspects by Leveraging Machine Learning in Cloud.",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 is the repugnant but the most searched word since its outbreak in November 2019 across the globe. The world has to battle with it until an effective solution is developed. Due to the advancement in mobile and sensor technology, it is possible to come up with Internet of things-based healthcare systems. These novel healthcare systems can be proactive and preventive rather than traditional reactive healthcare systems. This article proposes a real-time IoT-enabled framework for the detection and prediction of COVID-19 suspects in early stages, by collecting symptomatic data and analyzing the nature of the virus in a better manner. The framework computes the presence of COVID-19 virus by mining the health parameters collected in real time from sensors and other IoT devices. The framework is comprised of four main components: user system or data collection center, data analytic center, diagnostic system, and cloud system. To point out and detect the COVID-19 suspected in real time, this work proposes the five machine learning techniques, namely support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and neural network. In our proposed framework, the real and primary dataset collected from SKIMS, Srinagar, is used to validate our work. The experiment on the primary dataset was conducted using different machine learning techniques on selected symptoms. The efficiency of algorithms is calculated by computing the results of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, root-mean-square error, and area under the curve score. The employed machine learning techniques have shown the accuracy of above 95% on the primary symptomatic data. Based on the experiment conducted, the proposed framework would be effective in the early identification and prediction of COVID-19 suspect realizing the nature of the disease in better way.",

    "title": "Two-stage feature selection for classification of gene expression data based on an improved Salp Swarm Algorithm.",
    "abstract": "Microarray technology has developed rapidly in recent years, producing a large number of ultra-high dimensional gene expression data. However, due to the huge sample size and dimension proportion of gene expression data, it is very challenging work to screen important genes from gene expression data. For small samples of high-dimensional biomedical data, this paper proposes a two-stage feature selection framework combining Wrapper, embedding and filtering to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The proposed framework uses weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA), random forest and minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) for first stage feature selection. In the second stage, a new gene selection method based on the improved binary Salp Swarm Algorithm is proposed, which combines machine learning methods to adaptively select feature subsets suitable for classification algorithms. Finally, the classification accuracy is evaluated using six methods: lightGBM, RF, SVM, XGBoost, MLP and KNN. To verify the performance of the framework and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the number of genes selected and the classification accuracy was compared with the other five intelligent optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed framework achieves an accuracy equal to or higher than other advanced intelligent algorithms on 10 datasets, and achieves an accuracy of over 97.6% on all 10 datasets. This shows that the method proposed in this paper can solve the feature selection problem related to high-dimensional data, and the proposed framework has no data set limitation, and it can be applied to other fields involving feature selection.",

    "abstract": "To develop two intelligent diagnosis models of detrusor overactivity (DO) based on deep learning to assist doctors no longer heavily rely on visual observation of urodynamic study (UDS) curves. UDS curves of 92 patients were collected during 2019. We constructed two DO event recognition models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with 44 samples, and tested the model performance with the remaining 48 samples by comparing other four classical machine learning models. During the testing phase, we developed a threshold screening strategy to quickly filter out suspected DO event segments in each patient's UDS curve. If two or more DO event fragments are determined to be DO by the diagnostic model, the patient is diagnosed as having DO. We extracted 146 DO event samples and 1863 non-DO event samples from the UDS curves of 44 patients to train CNN models. Through 10-fold cross-validation, the training accuracy and validation accuracy of our models achieved the highest accuracy. In the model testing phase, we used a threshold screening strategy to quickly screen out the suspected DO event samples in the UDS curve of another 48 patients, and then input them into the trained models. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of patients without DO and patients with DO was 78.12% and 100%, respectively. Under the available data, the accuracy of the DO diagnostic model based on CNN is satisfactory. With the increase of the amount of data, the deep learning model is likely to have better performance. This experiment was certified by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200063467).",

    "title": "The applications of deep learning algorithms on in silico druggable proteins identification.",
    "abstract": "The top priority in drug development is to identify novel and effective drug targets. In vitro assays are frequently used for this purpose; however, traditional experimental approaches are insufficient for large-scale exploration of novel drug targets, as they are expensive, time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, computational methods have emerged in recent decades as an alternative to aid experimental drug discovery studies by developing sophisticated predictive models to estimate unknown drugs/compounds and their targets. The recent success of deep learning (DL) techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence has further attracted a great deal of attention in the biomedicine field, including computational drug discovery. This study focuses on the practical applications of deep learning algorithms for predicting druggable proteins and proposes a powerful predictor for fast and accurate identification of potential drug targets. Using a gold-standard dataset, we explored several typical protein features and different deep learning algorithms and evaluated their performance in a comprehensive way. We provide an overview of the entire experimental process, including protein features and descriptors, neural network architectures, libraries and toolkits for deep learning modelling, performance evaluation metrics, model interpretation and visualization. Experimental results show that the hybrid model (architecture: CNN-RNN (BiLSTM) + DNN; feature: dictionary encoding + DC_TC_CTD) performed better than the other models on the benchmark dataset. This hybrid model was able to achieve 90.0% accuracy and 0.800 MCC on the test dataset and 84.8% and 0.703 on a nonredundant independent test dataset, which is comparable to those of existing methods. We developed the first deep learning-based classifier for fast and accurate identification of potential druggable proteins. We hope that this study will be helpful for future researchers who would like to use deep learning techniques to develop relevant predictive models.",

    "abstract": "Oral bioavailability (F) is an essential determinant for the systemic exposure and dosing regimens of drug candidates. F is determined by numerous processes, and computational predictions of human estimates have so far shown limited results. We describe a new methodology where F in humans is predicted directly from chemical structure using an integrated strategy combining 9 machine learning models, 3 sets of structural alerts, and 2 physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models. We evaluate the model on a benchmark dataset consisting of 184 compounds, obtaining a predictive accuracy ( ) of 0.50, which is successful according to a pharmaceutical industry proposal. Twenty-seven compounds were found (beforehand) to be outside the main applicability domain for the model. We compare our results with interspecies correlations (rat, mouse and dog vs. human) using the same dataset, where animal vs. human-correlations ( ) were found to be 0.21 to 0.40 and maximum prediction errors were smaller than maximum interspecies differences. We conclude that our method has sufficient predictive accuracy to be practically useful with applications in human exposure and dose predictions, compound optimization and decision making, with potential to rationalize drug discovery and development and decrease failures and overexposures in early clinical trials with candidate drugs.",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, heart disease is spreading throughout the world very rapidly and the situation is becoming alarming in people aged 40 or above (Xu, 2020). Different methods and procedures are adopted to detect and diagnose heart abnormalities. Data scientists are working on finding the different methods with the required accuracy (Strodthoff et al., 2021). Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the procedure to find the heart condition in the waveform. For ages, the machine learning techniques, which are feature based, played a vital role in the medical sciences and centralized the data in cloud computing and having access throughout the world. Furthermore, deep learning or transfer learning widens the vision and introduces different transfer learning methods to ensure accuracy and time management to detect the ECG in a better way in comparison to the previous and machine learning methods. Hence, it is said that transfer learning has turned world research into more appropriate and innovative research. Here, the proposed comparison and accuracy analysis of different transfer learning methods by using ECG classification for detecting ECG Arrhythmia (CAA-TL). The CAA-TL model has the multiclassification of the ECG dataset, which has been taken from Kaggle. Some of the healthy and unhealthy datasets have been taken in real-time, augmented, and fused with the Kaggle dataset, i.e., Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH dataset). The CAA-TL worked on the accuracy of heart problem detection by using different methods like ResNet50, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet. All three deep learning methods showed remarkable accuracy, which is improved from the previous research. The comparison of different deep learning approaches with respect to layers widens the research and gives the more clarity and accuracy and at the same time finds it time-consuming while working with multiclassification with massive dataset of ECG. The implementation of the proposed method showed an accuracy of 98.8%, 90.08%, and 91% for AlexNet, SqueezeNet, and ResNet50, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to a complex set of processes involved with the recording of health information in the Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the truthfulness of EHR diagnosis records is questionable. We present a computational approach to estimate the probability that a single diagnosis record in the EHR reflects the true disease. Using EHR data on 18 diseases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank, we develop generative classifiers on a small set of disease-agnostic features from EHRs that aim to represent Patients, pRoviders, and their Interactions within the healthcare SysteM (PRISM features). We demonstrate that PRISM features and the generative PRISM classifiers are potent for estimating disease probabilities and exhibit generalizable and transferable distributional characteristics across diseases and patient populations. The joint probabilities we learn about diseases through the PRISM features via PRISM generative models are transferable and generalizable to multiple diseases. The Generative Transfer Learning (GTL) approach with PRISM classifiers enables the scalable validation of computable phenotypes in EHRs without the need for domain-specific knowledge about specific disease processes. Probabilities computed from the generative PRISM classifier can enhance and accelerate applied Machine Learning research and discoveries with EHR data.",

The key contributions are three heuristic rules to enhance the learning algorithm of FMM. First, a new hyperbox expansion rule to eliminate the overlapping problem during the hyperbox expansion process is suggested. Second, the existing hyperbox overlap test rule is extended to discover other possible overlapping cases. Third, a new hyperbox contraction rule to resolve possible overlapping cases is provided. Efficacy of EFMM is evaluated using benchmark data sets and a real medical diagnosis task. The results are better than those from various FMM-based models, support vector machine-based, Bayesian-based, decision tree-based, fuzzy-based, and neural-based classifiers. The empirical findings show that the newly introduced rules are able to realize EFMM as a useful model for undertaking pattern classification problems.",

Recently, machine learning techniques have been combined with neuroimaging methods to aid in the diagnosis of BPD. However, most studies have focused on the construction of classifiers based on single-modality MRI. Hence, in this study, we aimed to construct a support vector machine (SVM) model using a combination of structural and functional MRI, which could be used to accurately identify patients with BPD. In total, 44 patients with BPD and 36 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Clinical evaluation and MRI scans were performed for each subject. Next, image pre-processing, VBM and ReHo analyses were performed. The ReHo values of each subject in the clusters showing significant differences were extracted. Further, LASSO approach was recruited to screen features. Based on selected features, the SVM model was established, and discriminant analysis was performed. After using the two-sample t-test with multiple comparisons, a total of 8 clusters were extracted from the data (VBM = 6; ReHo = 2). Next, we used both VBM and ReHo data to construct the new SVM classifier, which could effectively identify patients with BPD at an accuracy of 87.5% (95%CI: 72.5-95.3%), sensitivity of 86.4% (95%CI: 64.0-96.4%), and specificity of 88.9% (95%CI: 63.9-98.0%) in the test data (p = 0.0022).

    "abstract": "Staying injury free is a major factor for success in sports. Although injuries are difficult to forecast, novel technologies and data-science applications could provide important insights. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs. Prediction of injuries was evaluated on a new data set of 74 high-level middle- and long-distance runners, over a period of 7 years. Two analytic approaches were applied. First, the training load from the previous 7 days was expressed as a time series, with each day's training being described by 10 features. These features were a combination of objective data from a global positioning system watch (eg, duration, distance), together with subjective data about the exertion and success of the training. Second, a training week was summarized by 22 aggregate features, and a time window of 3 weeks before the injury was considered. A predictive system based on bagged XGBoost machine-learning models resulted in receiver operating characteristic curves with average areas under the curves of 0.724 and 0.678 for the day and week approaches, respectively. The results of the day approach especially reflect a reasonably high probability that our system makes correct injury predictions. Our machine-learning-based approach predicts a sizable portion of the injuries, in particular when the model is based on training-load data in the days preceding an injury. Overall, these results demonstrate the possible merits of using machine learning to predict injuries and tailor training programs for athletes.",

    "abstract": "Timely prediction of memory failures is crucial for the stable operation of data centers. However, existing methods often rely on a single classifier, which can lead to inaccurate or unstable predictions. To address this, we propose a new ensemble model for predicting CE-driven memory failures, where failures occur due to a surge of correctable errors (CEs) in memory, causing server downtime. Our model combines several strong-performing classifiers, such as Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, and assigns different weights to each based on its performance. By optimizing the decision-making process, the model improves prediction accuracy. We validate the model using in-memory data from Alibaba's data center, and the results show an accuracy of over 84%, outperforming existing single and dual-classifier models, further confirming its excellent predictive performance.",

    "title": "Prediction of anemia using facial images and deep learning technology in the emergency department.",
    "abstract": "According to the WHO, anemia is a highly prevalent disease, especially for patients in the emergency department. The pathophysiological mechanism by which anemia can affect facial characteristics, such as membrane pallor, has been proven to detect anemia with the help of deep learning technology. The quick prediction method for the patient in the emergency department is important to screen the anemic state and judge the necessity of blood transfusion treatment. We trained a deep learning system to predict anemia using videos of 316 patients. All the videos were taken with the same portable pad in the ambient environment of the emergency department. The video extraction and face recognition methods were used to highlight the facial area for analysis. Accuracy and area under the curve were used to assess the performance of the machine learning system at the image level and the patient level. Three tasks were applied for performance evaluation. The objective of Task 1 was to predict patients' anemic states [hemoglobin (Hb) <13 g/dl in men and Hb <12 g/dl in women]. The accuracy of the image level was 82.37%, the area under the curve (AUC) of the image level was 0.84, the accuracy of the patient level was 84.02%, the sensitivity of the patient level was 92.59%, and the specificity of the patient level was 69.23%. The objective of Task 2 was to predict mild anemia (Hb <9 g/dl). The accuracy of the image level was 68.37%, the AUC of the image level was 0.69, the accuracy of the patient level was 70.58%, the sensitivity was 73.52%, and the specificity was 67.64%. The aim of task 3 was to predict severe anemia (Hb <7 g/dl). The accuracy of the image level was 74.01%, the AUC of the image level was 0.82, the accuracy of the patient level was 68.42%, the sensitivity was 61.53%, and the specificity was 83.33%. The machine learning system could quickly and accurately predict the anemia of patients in the emergency department and aid in the treatment decision for urgent blood transfusion. It offers great clinical value and practical significance in expediting diagnosis, improving medical resource allocation, and providing appropriate treatment in the future.",

    "title": "SWIFT-Active Screener: Accelerated document screening through active learning and integrated recall estimation.",
    "abstract": "In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate articles is relevant to the research question under consideration. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in and can utilize hundreds of person-hours of labor. Here we introduce SWIFT-Active Screener, a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application, designed to reduce the overall screening burden required during this resource-intensive phase of the review process. To prioritize articles for review, SWIFT-Active Screener uses active learning, a type of machine learning that incorporates user feedback during screening. Meanwhile, a negative binomial model is employed to estimate the number of relevant articles remaining in the unscreened document list. Using a simulation involving 26 diverse systematic review datasets that were previously screened by reviewers, we evaluated both the document prioritization and recall estimation methods. On average, 95% of the relevant articles were identified after screening only 40% of the total reference list. In the 5 document sets with 5,000 or more references, 95% recall was achieved after screening only 34% of the available references, on average. Furthermore, the recall estimator we have proposed provides a useful, conservative estimate of the percentage of relevant documents identified during the screening process. SWIFT-Active Screener can result in significant time savings compared to traditional screening and the savings are increased for larger project sizes. Moreover, the integration of explicit recall estimation during screening solves an important challenge faced by all machine learning systems for document screening: when to stop screening a prioritized reference list. The software is currently available in the form of a multi-user, collaborative, online web application.",

However, experimental data for many drug molecules are limited, especially for novel molecular structures or rare diseases which affect the accuracy of many deep learning methods that rely on large training datasets. To this end, we propose PG-DERN, a novel few-shot learning model for molecular property prediction. A dual-view encoder is introduced to learn a meaningful molecular representation by integrating information from node and subgraph. Next, a relation graph learning module is proposed to construct a relation graph based on the similarity between molecules, which improves the efficiency of information propagation and the accuracy of property prediction. In addition, we use a MAML-based meta-learning strategy to learn well-initialized meta-parameters. In order to guide the tuning of meta-parameters, a property-guided feature augmentation module is designed to transfer information from similar properties to the novel property to improve the comprehensiveness of the feature representation of molecules with novel property. A series of comparative experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed PG-DERN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

So, the paper utilizes the Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) statistical approach to examine how electricity pricing policies affect carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions within the household sector. The study utilizes the Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) statistical approach to examine how electricity pricing policies affect carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions within the household sector. To achieve this, it analyzes hourly data collected from 2011 to 2013. The analysis explores the causal relationship between potential outcomes and treatment effects, with changes in pricing policies serving as the treatment. This examination questions the traditional views on incentive-based electricity pricing. The results indicate that implementing such policies might unintentionally raise CO intensity. Furthermore, a contemporary statistical method involving a machine learning-based meta-algorithm is incorporated to deepen the causal analysis. Policymakers could encourage electricity consumers and producers by promoting the use of solar panels.",

    "abstract": "Treatments are limited for patients with relapsed/refractory Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and their survival rate is low. Prediction of the recurrence hazard for each patient could provide a reference regarding chemotherapy regimens for clinicians to extend patients' period of long-term remission. As current strategies cannot satisfy such need, we have established predictive models to classify patients with DLBCL with complete remission who had recurrences in 2 years from ones who did not. We assessed 518 patients with DLBCL and measured 52 variables of each patient. They were treated between January 2011 and July 2016. 17 variables were first selected by variable selection methods (including Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, and Elastic net). Then, we set classifiers and probability models for imbalanced data by combining the SMOTE sampling, cost-sensitive, and ensemble learning (consisting of AdaBoost, voting strategy, and Stacking) methods with the machine learning methods (Support Vector Machine, BackPropagation Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest), respectively. Last, assessed their performance. The disease stage and other 5 variables are significant indicators for recurrence. The SVM with AdaBoost ensemble learning method modeling by SMOTE data performs the best (Sensitivity=97.3%, AUC=96%, RMSE=19.6%, G-mean=96%) in all classifiers. The SVM with AdaBoost method(AUC=98.7%, RMSE=17.7%, MXE=12.7%, Cal mean=3.2%, BS0=2.5%, BS1=4%, BSALL=3.1%) and random forest (AUC=99.5%, RMSE=19.8%, MXE=16.2%, Cal mean=9.1%, BS0=4.8%, BS1=2.9%, BSALL=3.9%) both modeling by SMOTE sampling data perform well in probability models. This predictive model has high accuracy for almost all DLBCL patients and the six indicators can be recurrence signals.",

    "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis based on body fluids has been widely applied in disease diagnose. Choledocholithiasis is a widespread and often recurrent digestive system disease, with limited data on factors predicting its formation and reappearance. Bile contains many components that could provide valuable diagnostic information; however, the current diagnosis of biliary disease by SERS focuses on detecting specific component in the bile, overlooking the complex interplay and correlations among multiple factors that could be crucial for accurate diagnosis. This work directly obtained multi-component SERS spectral information of raw bile from 46 patients. Characteristic information was extracted from bile SERS spectra using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), revealing variations in the content of characteristic components associated with different choledocholithiasis types and their recurrence frequency. Pearson correlation analysis was also introduced to reveal the interactions of primary active substances pertinent to choledocholithiasis diagnosis. The efficacy of PCA and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in classifying stone types, presented an accuracy of 99.2 %. Furthermore, the interaction patterns among SERS characteristic components in choledocholithiasis recurrence frequency were revealed, and with the support of SVM, the prediction for different recurrence rates reached an accuracy of 95.2 %. Overall, this work demonstrates that integrating SERS with machine learning can support disease diagnosis and the interpretation of correlations among multiple components, facilitating elucidating the disease mechanisms.",

To solve this problem, we aim to explore the models offered by MONAI Generative Models, focusing on the Diffusion Models, to generate realistic synthetic cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images. The model used has been able to generate very realistic cardiac MR images in a fast and easy-to-implement way. Given that the obtained synthetic images closely resemble the real one to the extent of being difficult to distinguish them, the study has shown its potential utility in augmenting datasets for medical imaging purposes.Clinical Relevance- The current work presents a framework to generate large amounts of synthetic cardiac MR images.

    "abstract": "Communication is a core component of effective healthcare that impacts many patient and doctor outcomes, yet is complex and challenging to both analyse and teach. Human-based coding and audit systems are time-intensive and costly; thus, there is considerable interest in the application of artificial intelligence to this topic, through machine learning using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. In this article we introduce health communication, its importance for patient and health professional outcomes, and the need for rigorous empirical data to support this field. We then discuss historical interaction coding systems and recent developments in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate such coding in the health setting. Finally, we discuss available evidence for the reliability and validity of AI coding, application of AI in training and audit of communication, as well as limitations and future directions in this field. In summary, recent advances in machine learning have allowed accurate textual transcription, and analysis of prosody, pauses, energy, intonation, emotion and communication style. Studies have established moderate to good reliability of machine learning algorithms, comparable with human coding (or better), and have identified some expected and unexpected associations between communication variables and patient satisfaction. Finally, application of artificial intelligence to communication skills training has been attempted, to provide audit and feedback, and through the use of avatars. This looks promising to provide confidential and easily accessible training, but may be best used as an adjunct to human-based training.",

First, the radar echo data are analyzed and processed to extract the micro-Doppler time domain spectrograms of different actions. Second, a strategy combining asymmetric convolution and the Mish activation function is adopted in the residual block of the ResNet18 network to address the limitations of linear and nonlinear transformations in the residual block for micro-Doppler spectrum recognition. This approach aims to enhance the network's ability to learn features effectively. Finally, the Improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (ICBAM) is integrated into the residual block to enhance the model's attention and comprehension of input data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a high accuracy of 98.28% in action recognition and classification within complex scenes, surpassing classic deep learning approaches. Moreover, this method significantly improves the recognition accuracy for actions with similar micro-Doppler features and demonstrates excellent anti-noise recognition performance.",

Consequently, there is increasing interest in explainable artificial intelligence to rationalize predictions and uncover potential pitfalls. Among others, relevant approaches include feature attribution methods to identify molecular structures determining predictions and counterfactuals (CFs) or contrastive explanations. CFs are defined as variants of test instances with minimal modifications leading to opposing predictions. In medicinal chemistry, CFs have thus far only been little investigated although they are particularly intuitive from a chemical perspective. We introduce a new methodology for the systematic generation of CFs that is centered on well-defined structural analogues of test compounds. The approach is transparent, computationally straightforward, and shown to provide a wealth of CFs for test sets. The method is made freely available.",

    "title": "Machine learning-based guilt detection in text.",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) task called guilt detection, which focuses on detecting guilt in text. We identify guilt as a complex and vital emotion that has not been previously studied in NLP, and we aim to provide a more fine-grained analysis of it. To address the lack of publicly available corpora for guilt detection, we created VIC, a dataset containing 4622 texts from three existing emotion detection datasets that we binarized into guilt and no-guilt classes. We experimented with traditional machine learning methods using bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency features, achieving a 72% f1 score with the highest-performing model. Our study provides a first step towards understanding guilt in text and opens the door for future research in this area.",

    "title": "Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning-based breast cancer detection using mammograms.",
    "abstract": "Mammogram-based automatic breast cancer detection has a primary role in accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning to save valuable lives. Mammography is one basic yet efficient test for screening breast cancer. Very few comprehensive surveys have been presented to briefly analyze methods for detecting breast cancer with mammograms. In this article, our objective is to give an overview of recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based breast cancer detection systems. We give a structured framework to categorize mammogram-based breast cancer detection techniques. Several publicly available mammogram databases and different performance measures are also mentioned. After deliberate investigation, we find most of the works classify breast tumors either as normal-abnormal or malignant-benign rather than classifying them into three classes. Furthermore, DL-based features are more significant than hand-crafted features. However, transfer learning is preferred over others as it yields better performance in small datasets, unlike classical DL techniques. In this article, we have made an attempt to give recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based breast cancer detection systems. Furthermore, a number of challenging issues and possible research directions are mentioned, which will help researchers in further scopes of research in this field.",

    "title": "DeepIDC: A Prediction Framework of Injectable Drug Combination Based on Heterogeneous Information and Deep Learning.",
    "abstract": "In clinical practice, injectable drug combination (IDC) usually provides good therapeutic effects for patients. Numerous clinical studies have directly indicated that inappropriate IDC generates adverse drug events (ADEs). The clinical application of injections is increasing, and many injections lack relevant combination information. It is still a significant need for experienced clinical pharmacists to participate in evidence-based drug decision making, monitor medication safety, and manage drug interactions. Meanwhile, a large number of injection pairs and dosage combinations limit exhaustive screening. Here, we present a prediction framework, called DeepIDC, that can expediently screen the feasibility of IDCs using heterogeneous information with deep learning. This is the first specific prediction framework to identify IDCs. Since the interaction between the injected drugs may occur in the direct physical and chemical reactions at the time of mixing or may be the indirect interaction of their drug targets and pathways, we used molecular fingerprints, drug-target associations, and drug-pathway associations to convert injections into a string of digital vectors. Then, based on these injection vectors, we combined a bidirectional long short-term memory and a feed-forward neural network to build a prediction model for accurate and instructive prediction of IDC. In three realistic evaluation scenarios, DeepIDC has achieved ideal prediction results. Furthermore, compared with the other five machine-learning methods, the proposed predictor is more efficient and robust. Among the top 30 potential IDCs of each IDC class predicted by DeepIDC, we found that 9 cases were experimentally verified in the literature or available on Drug.com. The information we extracted in vivo and in vitro can effectively characterize injectable drugs. DeepIDC developed based on deep learning algorithm provides a valuable unified framework for new IDC discovery, which can make up for the lack of IDC information and predict potential IDC events.",

    "title": "Extreme learning machine and adaptive sparse representation for image classification.",
    "abstract": "Recent research has shown the speed advantage of extreme learning machine (ELM) and the accuracy advantage of sparse representation classification (SRC) in the area of image classification. Those two methods, however, have their respective drawbacks, e.g., in general, ELM is known to be less robust to noise while SRC is known to be time-consuming. Consequently, ELM and SRC complement each other in computational complexity and classification accuracy. In order to unify such mutual complementarity and thus further enhance the classification performance, we propose an efficient hybrid classifier to exploit the advantages of ELM and SRC in this paper. More precisely, the proposed classifier consists of two stages: first, an ELM network is trained by supervised learning. Second, a discriminative criterion about the reliability of the obtained ELM output is adopted to decide whether the query image can be correctly classified or not. If the output is reliable, the classification will be performed by ELM; otherwise the query image will be fed to SRC. Meanwhile, in the stage of SRC, a sub-dictionary that is adaptive to the query image instead of the entire dictionary is extracted via the ELM output. The computational burden of SRC thus can be reduced. Extensive experiments on handwritten digit classification, landmark recognition and face recognition demonstrate that the proposed hybrid classifier outperforms ELM and SRC in classification accuracy with outstanding computational efficiency.",

    "title": "Lateralized Learning to Solve Complex Boolean Problems.",
    "abstract": "Modern classifier systems can effectively classify targets that consist of simple patterns. However, they can fail to detect hierarchical patterns of features that exist in many real-world problems, such as understanding speech or recognizing object ontologies. Biological nervous systems have the ability to abstract knowledge from simple and small-scale problems in order to then apply it to resolve more complex problems in similar and related domains. It is thought that lateral asymmetry of biological brains allows modular learning to occur at different levels of abstraction, which can then be transferred between tasks. This work develops a novel evolutionary machine-learning (EML) system that incorporates lateralization and modular learning at different levels of abstraction. The results of analyzable Boolean tasks show that the lateralized system has the ability to encapsulate underlying knowledge patterns in the form of building blocks of knowledge (BBK). Lateralized abstraction transforms complex problems into simple ones by reusing general patterns (e.g., any parity problem becomes a sequence of the 2-bit parity problem). By enabling abstraction in evolutionary computation, the lateralized system is able to identify complex patterns (e.g., in hierarchical multiplexer (HMux) problems) better than existing systems.",

In this study, we focused on assessing the surface SOC content in Shandong Province based on land use types, and explored its spatial distribution pattern and influencing factors. Machine learning methods including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to estimate the surface SOC content in Shandong Province using diverse data sources like sample data, remote sensing data, socio-economic data, soil texture data, topographic data, and meteorological data. The results revealed that the SOC content in Shandong Province was 8.78 g/kg, exhibiting significant variation across different regions. Comparing the model error and correlation coefficient, the XGBoost model showed the highest prediction accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.7548, root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.6792, and relative percentage difference (RPD) of 1.1311. Elevation and Clay exhibited the highest explanatory power in clarifying the surface SOC content in Shandong Province, contributing 21.74% and 13.47%, respectively. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that SOC content was higher in forest-covered mountainous regions compared to cropland-covered plains and coastal areas. In conclusion, these findings offer valuable scientific insights for land use planning and SOC conservation.",

    "title": "Predicting Popularity of Video Streaming Services with Representation Learning: A Survey and a Real-World Case Study.",
    "abstract": "The Internet's popularization has increased the amount of content produced and consumed on the web. To take advantage of this new market, major content producers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have emerged, focusing on video streaming services. However, despite the large number and diversity of videos made available by these content providers, few of them attract the attention of most users. For example, in the data explored in this article, only 6% of the most popular videos account for 85% of total views. Finding out in advance which videos will be popular is not trivial, especially given many influencing variables. Nevertheless, a tool with this ability would be of great value to help dimension network infrastructure and properly recommend new content to users. In this way, this manuscript examines the machine learning-based approaches that have been proposed to solve the prediction of web content popularity. To this end, we first survey the literature and elaborate a taxonomy that classifies models according to predictive features and describes state-of-the-art features and techniques used to solve this task. While analyzing previous works, we saw an opportunity to use textual features for video prediction. Thus, additionally, we propose a case study that combines features acquired through attribute engineering and word embedding to predict the popularity of a video. The first approach is based on predictive attributes defined by resource engineering. The second takes advantage of word embeddings from video descriptions and titles. We experimented with the proposed techniques in a set of videos from GloboPlay, the largest provider of video streaming services in Latin America. A combination of engineering features and embeddings using the Random Forest algorithm achieved the best result, with an accuracy of 87%.",

    "title": "Early detection of autism spectrum disorder using explainable AI and optimized teaching strategies.",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by the deficits of social relating, language, object use and understanding, intelligence and learning, and verbal and nonverbal communication. Most of the individuals with ASD have genetic conditions; however, early identification and intervention reduce the use of health services and other diagnostic procedures. The varied nature of ASD is widely acknowledged, with each affected individual displaying distinct traits. The variability among autistic children underscores the challenge of identifying effective teaching strategies, as what works for one child may not be suitable for another. In this study, we merge two ASD screening datasets focusing on toddlers. We employ three feature engineering techniques to extract significant features from the dataset to enhance model performance. This study presents an innovative two-phase method where initially, we employ diverse machine learning models, such as a combination of logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers. The focus of the second phase is on identifying tailored educational methods for children with ASD through the assessment of their behavioral, verbal, and physical responses. The main goal of this study is to develop personalized educational strategies for individuals with ASD. This will be achieved by employing machine learning techniques to enhance precision and better meet their unique needs. Experimental results achieve a classification accuracy of 94% in ASD identification using Chi-square extracted features. Concerning the choice of the best teaching approach for ASD children, the proposed approach shows 99.29% accuracy. Performance comparison with existing studies shows the superior performance of the proposed LR-SVM ensemble coupled with Chi-square features. In conclusion, the proposed approach provides a two-phase strategy for identifying ASD children and offering a suitable teaching strategy with respect to the severity of the ASD, thereby potentially contributing to the development of tailored solutions for children with varying needs.",

    "abstract": "Aimless movement or wandering may be a symptom of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that arises as a consequence of confusion and forgetfulness. This paper presents a support vector machine (SVM) framework based on movement analysis for the prediction of the onset and progression of MCI. Movement data of 22 subjects with MCI, and 22 other healthy subjects, living independently in smart homes were collected for ten years using motion sensors. Features were extracted from the sensor data using movement metrics, including cyclomatic complexity, detrended fluctuation analysis, fractal index, entropy, and room transitions. Two different SVM classification algorithms were trained using the features, first to predict the progression of MCI in the post-transition period, and second to predict the onset of MCI in the pre-transition phase. The two SVMs were able to detect the onset six months earlier than the clinical diagnosis. The model accuracy in classifying MCI increased monotonically from the onset month and reached maximum (81%) at the 11 post-transition month. The features of cyclomatic complexity contributed significantly to the prediction results. Findings support the use of movement complexity measures and machine learning for monitoring cognitive behavior in an independent living environment.",

The data-centric AI approach emphasizes the importance of high-quality, diverse, and well-annotated datasets in driving advancements in this field. However, current facial datasets, such as Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ), lack detailed annotations for detecting facial accessories, particularly eyeglasses. This work addresses this limitation by extending the FFHQ dataset with precise bounding box annotations for eyeglasses detection, enhancing its utility for data-centric AI applications. The extended dataset comprises 70,000 images, including over 16,000 images containing eyewear, and it exceeds the CelebAMask-HQ dataset in size and diversity. A semi-automated protocol was employed to efficiently generate accurate bounding box annotations, minimizing the demand for extensive manual labeling. This enriched dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and benchmarking eyewear detection models. Additionally, the baseline benchmark results for eyeglasses detection were presented using deep learning methods, including YOLOv8 and MobileNetV3. The evaluation, conducted through cross-dataset validation, demonstrated the robustness of models trained on the extended FFHQ dataset with their superior performances over existing alternative CelebAMask-HQ. The extended dataset, which has been made publicly available, is expected to support future research and development in eyewear detection, contributing to advancements in facial analysis and related fields.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) by means of electroencephalography (EEG) is not a trivial task during clinical practice for neurologists. No clear PNES electrophysiological biomarker has yet been found, and the only tool available for diagnosis is video EEG monitoring with recording of a typical episode and clinical history of the subject. In this paper, a data-driven machine learning (ML) pipeline for classifying EEG segments (i.e., epochs) of PNES and healthy controls (CNT) is introduced. This software pipeline consists of a semiautomatic signal processing technique and a supervised ML classifier to aid clinical discriminative diagnosis of PNES by means of an EEG time series. In our ML pipeline, statistical features like the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness are extracted in a power spectral density (PSD) map split up in five conventional EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and the whole band, i.e., 1-32 Hz). Then, the feature vector is fed into three different supervised ML algorithms, namely, the support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Bayesian network (BN), to perform EEG segment classification tasks for CNT vs. PNES. The performance of the pipeline algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 20 EEG signals (10 PNES and 10 CNT) that was recorded in eyes-closed resting condition at the Regional Epilepsy Centre, Great Metropolitan Hospital of Reggio Calabria, University of Catanzaro, Italy. The experimental results showed that PNES vs. CNT discrimination tasks performed via the ML algorithm and validated with random split (RS) achieved an average accuracy of 0.97 ± 0.013 (RS-SVM), 0.99 ± 0.02 (RS-LDA), and 0.82 ± 0.109 (RS-BN). Meanwhile, with leave-one-out (LOO) validation, an average accuracy of 0.98 ± 0.0233 (LOO-SVM), 0.98 ± 0.124 (LOO-LDA), and 0.81 ± 0.109 (LOO-BN) was achieved. Our findings showed that BN was outperformed by SVM and LDA. The promising results of the proposed software pipeline suggest that it may be a valuable tool to support existing clinical diagnosis.",

The developed models were applied for the prediction of the studied properties for a focused virtual library of 3057 phosphoryl podands generated using SMF contributions promising for selective binding of lithium.

    "abstract": "With the popularity of recreational activities, the study aimed to develop prediction models for recreational activity participation and explore the key factors affecting participation in recreational activities. A total of 12,712 participants, excluding individuals under 20, were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018. The mean age of the sample was 46.86 years (±16.97), with a gender distribution of 6,721 males and 5,991 females. The variables included demographic, physical-related variables, and lifestyle variables. This study developed 42 prediction models using six machine learning methods, including logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The relative importance of each variable was evaluated by permutation feature importance. The results illustrated that the LightGBM was the most effective algorithm for predicting recreational activity participation (accuracy: .838, precision: .783, recall: .967, F1-score: .865, AUC: .826). In particular, prediction performance increased when the demographic and lifestyle datasets were used together. Next, as the result of the permutation feature importance based on the top models, education level and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were found to be essential variables. These findings demonstrated the potential of a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning in a recreational discipline. Furthermore, this study interpreted the prediction model through feature importance analysis to overcome the limitation of machine learning interpretability.",

    "title": "Machine learning strategy identification: A paradigm to uncover decision strategies with high fidelity.",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach, which we call machine learning strategy identification (MLSI), to uncovering hidden decision strategies. In this approach, we first train machine learning models on choice and process data of one set of participants who are instructed to use particular strategies, and then use the trained models to identify the strategies employed by a new set of participants. Unlike most modeling approaches that need many trials to identify a participant's strategy, MLSI can distinguish strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. We examined MLSI's performance in three experiments. In Experiment I, we taught participants three different strategies in a paired-comparison decision task. The best machine learning model identified the strategies used by participants with an accuracy rate above 90%. In Experiment II, we compared MLSI with the multiple-measure maximum likelihood (MM-ML) method that is also capable of integrating multiple types of data in strategy identification, and found that MLSI had higher identification accuracy than MM-ML. In Experiment III, we provided feedback to participants who made decisions freely in a task environment that favors the non-compensatory strategy take-the-best. The trial-by-trial results of MLSI show that during the course of the experiment, most participants explored a range of strategies at the beginning, but eventually learned to use take-the-best. Overall, the results of our study demonstrate that MLSI can identify hidden strategies on a trial-by-trial basis and with a high level of accuracy that rivals the performance of other methods that require multiple trials for strategy identification.",

    "abstract": "From patient-reported surveys and individual interviews by health care providers, we attempted to identify the significant factors related to the improvement of distress and fatigue for cancer survivors by text analysis with machine learning techniques, as the secondary analysis using the single institute data from the Korean Cancer Survivorship Center Pilot Project. Surveys and in-depth interviews from 322 cancer survivors were analyzed to identify their needs and concerns. Among the keywords in the surveys, including EQ-VAS, distress, fatigue, pain, insomnia, anxiety, and depression, distress and fatigue were focused. The interview transcripts were analyzed via Korean-based text analysis with machine learning techniques, based on the keywords used in the survey. Words were generated as vectors and similarity scores were calculated by the distance related to the text's keywords and frequency. The keywords and selected high-ranked ten words for each keyword based on the similarity were then taken to draw a network map. Most participants were otherwise healthy females younger than 50 years suffering breast cancer who completed treatment less than 6 months ago. As the 1-month follow-up survey's results, the improved patients were 56.5 and 58.4% in distress and fatigue scores, respectively. For the improvement of distress, dyspepsia (p = 0.006) and initial scores of distress, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.043, and 0.013, respectively) were significantly related. For the improvement of fatigue, economic state (p = 0.021), needs for rehabilitation (p = 0.035), initial score of fatigue (p < 0.001), any intervention (p = 0.017), and participation in family care program (p = 0.022) were significant. For the text analysis, Stress and Fatigue were placed at the center of the keyword network map, and words were intricately connected. From the regression anlysis combined survey scores and the quantitative variables from the text analysis, participation in family care programs and mention of family-related words were associated with the fatigue improvement (p = 0.033). Common symptoms and practical issues were related to distress and fatigue in the survey. Through text analysis, however, we realized that the specific issues and their relationship such as family problem were more complicated. Although further research needs to explore the hidden problem in cancer patients, this study was meaningful to use personalized approach such as interviews.",

    "abstract": "Some drugs and xenobiotics have the potential to disturb homeostasis, normal growth, differentiation, development or behavior during prenatal development or postnatally until puberty. Assessment of the developmental toxicity is one of the important safety considerations incorporated by international regulatory agencies. In this investigation, seven machine learning methods, including naïve Bayes, support vector machine, recursive partitioning, k-nearest neighbor, C4.5 decision tree, random forest and Adaboost, were used to build binary classification models for developmental toxicity. Among these models, the naïve Bayes classifier represented the best predictive performance and stability, which gave 91.11% overall prediction accuracy, 91.50% balanced accuracy and 0.818 MCC for the training set, and generated 83.93% concordance, 81.85% balanced accuracy and 0.627 MCC for the test set. The application domains were analyzed, and only one chemical in the test set was identified as outside the application domain. In addition, 10 important molecular descriptors related to developmental toxicity were selected by the genetic algorithm, which may contribute to explanation of the mechanisms of developmental toxicants. The best naïve Bayes classification model should be employed as alternative method for qualitative prediction of chemical-induced developmental toxicity in early stages of drug development.",

Recent explorations of distributed-learning paradigms, particularly federated learning, have aimed to mitigate these challenges. However, these approaches are often encumbered by substantial communication and computational overhead, and potential vulnerabilities in privacy safeguards. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised masked sampling distillation technique called MS-DINO, tailored to the vision transformer architecture. This approach removes the need for incessant communication and strengthens privacy using a modified encryption mechanism inherent to the vision transformer while minimizing the computational burden on client-side devices. Rigorous evaluations across various tasks confirmed that our method outperforms existing self-supervised distributed learning strategies and fine-tuned baselines.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support general practice in the early detection of disease and treatment recommendations. However, AI systems aimed at alleviating time-consuming administrative tasks currently appear limited. This scoping review thus aims to summarize the research that has been carried out in methods of machine learning applied to the support and automation of administrative tasks in general practice. Databases covering the fields of health care and engineering sciences (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL with full text, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore) were searched. Screening for eligible studies was completed using Covidence, and data was extracted along nine research-based attributes concerning general practice, administrative tasks, and machine learning. The search and screening processes were completed during the period of April to June 2022. 1439 records were identified and 1158 were screened for eligibility criteria. A total of 12 studies were included. The extracted attributes indicate that most studies concern various scheduling tasks using supervised machine learning methods with relatively low general practitioner (GP) involvement. Importantly, four studies employed the latest available machine learning methods and the data used frequently varied in terms of setting, type, and availability. The limited field of research developing in the application of machine learning to administrative tasks in general practice indicates that there is a great need and high potential for such methods. However, there is currently a lack of research likely due to the unavailability of open-source data and a prioritization of diagnostic-based tasks. Future research would benefit from open-source data, cutting-edge methods of machine learning, and clearly stated GP involvement, so that improved and replicable scientific research can be done.",

    "title": "Discriminating early- and late-stage cancers using multiple kernel learning on gene sets.",
    "abstract": "Identifying molecular mechanisms that drive cancers from early to late stages is highly important to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies. Standard machine learning algorithms could be used to discriminate early- and late-stage cancers from each other using their genomic characterizations. Even though these algorithms would get satisfactory predictive performance, their knowledge extraction capability would be quite restricted due to highly correlated nature of genomic data. That is why we need algorithms that can also extract relevant information about these biological mechanisms using our prior knowledge about pathways/gene sets. In this study, we addressed the problem of separating early- and late-stage cancers from each other using their gene expression profiles. We proposed to use a multiple kernel learning (MKL) formulation that makes use of pathways/gene sets (i) to obtain satisfactory/improved predictive performance and (ii) to identify biological mechanisms that might have an effect in cancer progression. We extensively compared our proposed MKL on gene sets algorithm against two standard machine learning algorithms, namely, random forests and support vector machines, on 20 diseases from the Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts for two different sets of experiments. Our method obtained statistically significantly better or comparable predictive performance on most of the datasets using significantly fewer gene expression features. We also showed that our algorithm was able to extract meaningful and disease-specific information that gives clues about the progression mechanism. Our implementations of support vector machine and multiple kernel learning algorithms in R are available at https://github.com/mehmetgonen/gsbc together with the scripts that replicate the reported experiments.",

Understanding the effects of utilizing DP synthetic data in end-to-end machine learning pipelines impacts areas such as health care and humanitarian action, where data is scarce and regulated by restrictive privacy laws. In this work, we investigate the extent to which synthetic data can replace real, tabular data in machine learning pipelines and identify the most effective synthetic data generation techniques for training and evaluating machine learning models. We systematically investigate the impacts of differentially private synthetic data on downstream classification tasks from the point of view of utility as well as fairness. Our analysis is comprehensive and includes representatives of the two main types of synthetic data generation algorithms: marginal-based and GAN-based. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that: (i) proposes a training and evaluation framework that does not assume that real data is available for testing the utility and fairness of machine learning models trained on synthetic data; (ii) presents the most extensive analysis of synthetic dataset generation algorithms in terms of utility and fairness when used for training machine learning models; and (iii) encompasses several different definitions of fairness. Our findings demonstrate that marginal-based synthetic data generators surpass GAN-based ones regarding model training utility for tabular data. Indeed, we show that models trained using data generated by marginal-based algorithms can exhibit similar utility to models trained using real data. Our analysis also reveals that the marginal-based synthetic data generated using AIM and MWEM PGM algorithms can train models that simultaneously achieve utility and fairness characteristics close to those obtained by models trained with real data.",

These features, obtained from isosurfaces of each scan at different intensity levels, have been classified through the use of classical Machine Learning classifiers such as Support-Vector-Machines (SVM) or Naïve Bayesian and compared with the results obtained using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The proposed system, based on a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-Test for feature selection and the SVM approach, yielded a [Formula: see text] balanced accuracy when the performance was evaluated using a [Formula: see text]-fold cross-validation. This proves the reliability of these biomarkers, especially those related to sphericity, center of mass, number of vertices, 2D-projected perimeter or the 2D-projected eccentricity, among others, but including both internal and external isosurfaces.",

Advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques and increased accessibility of remote sensing data products have enabled the analysis of waterbody surface area dynamics on broad spatial scales. However, interpreting the ML results remains a challenge. While ML provides important tools for identifying patterns, the resultant models do not include mechanisms. Thus, the \"black-box\" nature of ML techniques often lacks ecological meaning. Using ML, we characterized temporal patterns in lake and reservoir surface area change from 1984 to 2016 for 103,930 waterbodies in the contiguous United States. We then employed knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) to classify all waterbodies into seven ecologically interpretable groups representing distinct patterns of surface area change over time. Many waterbodies were classified as having \"no change\" (43%), whereas the remaining 57% of waterbodies fell into other groups representing both linear and nonlinear patterns. This analysis demonstrates the potential of KGML not only for identifying ecologically relevant patterns of change across time but also for unraveling complex processes that underpin those changes.",

Advanced \"omics\" coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence (deep learning) methods have helped elucidate targets and pathways critical to those processes that may be amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations. Machine and deep learning methods have especially enabled leaps in those successes. This review will discuss these methods as they pertain to cancer biology as well as immunomodulation for drug repurposing opportunities in oncologic diseases.",

Machine learning promises to automatically determine efficient representations from large unstructured datasets, such as those arising in biology. However, empirical evidence suggests that seemingly minor changes to these machine learning models yield drastically different data representations that result in different biological interpretations of data. This begs the question of what even constitutes the most meaningful representation. Here, we approach this question for representations of protein sequences, which have received considerable attention in the recent literature. We explore two key contexts in which representations naturally arise: transfer learning and interpretable learning. In the first context, we demonstrate that several contemporary practices yield suboptimal performance, and in the latter we demonstrate that taking representation geometry into account significantly improves interpretability and lets the models reveal biological information that is otherwise obscured.",

    "abstract": "The discriminability of Bag-of-Words representations can be increased via encoding the spatial relationship among virtual words on 3D shapes. However, this encoding task involves several issues, including arbitrary mesh resolutions, irregular vertex topology, orientation ambiguity on 3D surface, invariance to rigid and non-rigid shape transformations. To address these issues, a novel unsupervised spatial learning framework based on deep neural network, deep spatiality (DS), is proposed. Specifically, DS employs two novel components: spatial context extractor and deep context learner. Spatial context extractor extracts the spatial relationship among virtual words in a local region into a raw spatial representation. Along a consistent circular direction, a directed circular graph is constructed to encode relative positions between pairwise virtual words in each face ring into a relative spatial matrix. By decomposing each relative spatial matrix using SVD, the raw spatial representation is formed, from which deep context learner conducts unsupervised learning of global and local features. Deep context learner is a deep neural network with a novel model structure to adapt the proposed coupled softmax layer, which encodes not only the discriminative information among local regions but also the one among global shapes. Experimental results show that DS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Skin lesions encompass a variety of skin abnormalities, including skin diseases that affect structure and function, and skin cancer, which can be fatal and arise from abnormal cell growth. Early detection of lesions and automated prediction is crucial, yet accurately identifying responsible regions post-dominance dispersion remains a challenge in current studies. Thus, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach employing a Customized Transfer Learning (CTL) model and Triple Attention (TA) modules in conjunction with Ensemble Learning (EL). While Ensemble Learning has become an integral component of both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies, a specific technique ensuring optimal allocation of weights for each model's prediction is currently lacking. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to introduce a novel method for determining optimal weights to aggregate the contributions of models for achieving desired outcomes. We term this approach \"Information Gain Proportioned Averaging (IGPA),\" further refining it to \"Multi-Level Information Gain Proportioned Averaging (ML-IGPA),\" which specifically involves the utilization of IGPA at multiple levels. Empirical evaluation of the HAM1000 dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves 94.93% accuracy with ML-IGPA, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Given previous studies' failure to elucidate the exact focus of black-box models on specific regions, we utilize the Gradient Class Activation Map (GradCAM) to identify responsible regions and enhance explainability. Our study enhances both accuracy and interpretability, facilitating early diagnosis and preventing the consequences of neglecting skin lesion detection, thereby addressing issues related to time, accessibility, and costs.",

Medical ML systems can be exposed to various forms of data drift, including differences between the data sampled for training and used in clinical operation, differences between medical practices or context of use between training and clinical use, and time-related changes in patient populations, disease patterns, and data acquisition, to name a few. In this article, we first review the terminology used in ML literature related to data drift, define distinct types of drift, and discuss in detail potential causes within the context of medical applications with an emphasis on medical imaging. We then review the recent literature regarding the effects of data drift on medical ML systems, which overwhelmingly show that data drift can be a major cause for performance deterioration. We then discuss methods for monitoring data drift and mitigating its effects with an emphasis on pre- and post-deployment techniques. Some of the potential methods for drift detection and issues around model retraining when drift is detected are included. Based on our review, we find that data drift is a major concern in medical ML deployment and that more research is needed so that ML models can identify drift early, incorporate effective mitigation strategies and resist performance decay.",

    "title": "Application of network link prediction in drug discovery.",
    "abstract": "Technological and research advances have produced large volumes of biomedical data. When represented as a network (graph), these data become useful for modeling entities and interactions in biological and similar complex systems. In the field of network biology and network medicine, there is a particular interest in predicting results from drug-drug, drug-disease, and protein-protein interactions to advance the speed of drug discovery. Existing data and modern computational methods allow to identify potentially beneficial and harmful interactions, and therefore, narrow drug trials ahead of actual clinical trials. Such automated data-driven investigation relies on machine learning techniques. However, traditional machine learning approaches require extensive preprocessing of the data that makes them impractical for large datasets. This study presents wide range of machine learning methods for predicting outcomes from biomedical interactions and evaluates the performance of the traditional methods with more recent network-based approaches. We applied a wide range of 32 different network-based machine learning models to five commonly available biomedical datasets, and evaluated their performance based on three important evaluations metrics namely AUROC, AUPR, and F1-score. We achieved this by converting link prediction problem as binary classification problem. In order to achieve this we have considered the existing links as positive example and randomly sampled negative examples from non-existant set. After experimental evaluation we found that Prone, ACT and [Formula: see text] are the top 3 best performers on all five datasets. This work presents a comparative evaluation of network-based machine learning algorithms for predicting network links, with applications in the prediction of drug-target and drug-drug interactions, and applied well known network-based machine learning methods. Our work is helpful in guiding researchers in the appropriate selection of machine learning methods for pharmaceutical tasks.",

    "abstract": "The function of a sewage treatment plant is to treat the sewage to acceptable standards before being discharged into the receiving waters. To design and operate such plants, it is necessary to measure and predict the influent flow rate. In this research, the influent flow rate of a sewage treatment plant (STP) was modelled and predicted by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), nonlinear autoregressive network (NAR) and support vector machine (SVM) regression time series algorithms. To evaluate the models' accuracy, the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R ) were calculated as initial assessment measures, while relative error (RE), peak flow criterion (PFC) and low flow criterion (LFC) were calculated as final evaluation measures to demonstrate the detailed accuracy of the selected models. An integrated model was developed based on the individual models' prediction ability for low, average and peak flow. An initial assessment of the results showed that the ARIMA model was the least accurate and the NAR model was the most accurate. The RE results also prove that the SVM model's frequency of errors above 10% or below - 10% was greater than the NAR model's. The influent was also forecasted up to 44 weeks ahead by both models. The graphical results indicate that the NAR model made better predictions than the SVM model. The final evaluation of NAR and SVM demonstrated that SVM made better predictions at peak flow and NAR fit well for low and average inflow ranges. The integrated model developed includes the NAR model for low and average influent and the SVM model for peak inflow.",

Its core idea is to quantify asymmetry as violation of certain partial differential equations, and to numerically minimize such violation over the space of all invertible transformations, parametrized as invertible neural networks. For example, our method rediscovers the famous Gullstrand-Painlevé metric that manifests hidden translational symmetry in the Schwarzschild metric of nonrotating black holes, as well as Hamiltonicity, modularity, and other simplifying traits not traditionally viewed as symmetries.",

However, in many cases, it does not allow unambiguous identification of the species due to their visual similarity. Therefore, it is usually necessary to use additional biochemical tests. That involves additional costs and extends the identification process up to 10 days. Such a delay in the implementation of targeted therapy may be grave in consequence as the mortality rate for immunosuppressed patients is high. In this paper, we apply a machine learning approach based on deep neural networks and bag-of-words to classify microscopic images of various fungi species. Our approach makes the last stage of biochemical identification redundant, shortening the identification process by 2-3 days, and reducing the cost of the diagnosis.",

    "title": "A synergistic approach for enhanced eye blink detection using wavelet analysis, autoencoding and Crow-Search optimized k-NN algorithm.",
    "abstract": "This research endeavor introduces a state-of-the-art, assimilated approach for eye blink detection from Electroencephalography signals. It combines the prominent strategies of wavelet analysis, autoencoding, and a Crow-Search-optimized k-Nearest Neighbors to enhance the performance of eye blink detection from EEG signals. This procedure is initiated by escalating the robustness of EEG data through jittering, which integrates noise into the dataset. Consequently, the wavelet transform is highly demanded during feature extraction in identifying the essential time-frequency components of the signals. These features are further distilled using an autoencoder to provide a dense, yet informative representation. Prior to introducing these features into the machine learning system, they were adjusted. Evidently, the hyperparameters of the k-Nearest Neighbors model have been fine-tuned using Crow Search Algorithm, inspired by the hunting characteristics of crows. This optimization method actively samples the search space to balance exploration and exploitation to identify the optimal configuration for the model. The k-NN model that has been optimized using the proposed method demonstrates significantly higher performance in the eye blink detection process in comparison to the deep learning models when equipped with decorous feature extraction and fine tuning. The effectiveness of the developed system has been ascertained according to the assessment indices such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrix. Thus, the present work offers an optimal method of detecting the eye blink from the EEG signals assisting in the development of further EEG applications including user interfaces, fatigue level identification, and neurological disorders analysis through the enhancement of signal processing and optimization methods. It becomes evident after a detailed evaluation that conventional machine learning algorithms if implemented with correct feature extraction and fine-tuning surpass the deep learning approaches including the frameworks composed of Convolutional Neural Network and Principal Component Analysis and empirical mode decomposition by approximately 96% across all datasets. This proves the advantage of optimized traditional Machine Learning models over the Deep Learning models in realistic EEG-based eye blink detection.",

We performed machine learning-based QC on each weather element of atmospheric data, such as temperature, acquired from seven types of IoT sensors and applied machine learning algorithms, such as support vector regression, on data with errors to make meaningful estimates from them. By using the root mean squared error (RMSE), we evaluated the performance of the proposed techniques. As a result, the QC done in conjunction with other weather elements had 0.14% lower RMSE on average than QC conducted with only a single weather element. In the case of QC with spatiotemporal characteristic considerations, the QC done via training with AWS data showed performance with 17% lower RMSE than QC done with only raw data.",

    "abstract": "Node representation learning in a network is an important machine learning technique for encoding relational information in a continuous vector space while preserving the inherent properties and structures of the network. Recently, unsupervised node embedding methods such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), LINE (Tang et al., 2015), struc2vec (Ribeiro et al., 2017), PTE (Tang et al., 2015), UserItem2vec (Wu et al., 2020), and RWJBG (Li et al., 2021) have emerged from the Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) and perform better performance in several downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction than the existing relational models. However, providing post-hoc explanations of unsupervised embeddings remains a challenging problem because of the lack of explanation methods and theoretical studies applicable for embeddings. In this paper, we first show that global explanations to the Skip-gram-based embeddings can be found by computing bridgeness under a spectral cluster-aware local perturbation. Moreover, a novel gradient-based explanation method, which we call GRAPH-wGD, is proposed that allows the top-q global explanations about learned graph embedding vectors more efficiently. Experiments show that the ranking of nodes by scores using GRAPH-wGD is highly correlated with true bridgeness scores. We also observe that the top-q node-level explanations selected by GRAPH-wGD have higher importance scores and produce more changes in class label prediction when perturbed, compared with the nodes selected by recent alternatives, using five real-world graphs.",

    "abstract": "Domestic waste is prone to produce a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which often has unpleasant odors. A key process in treating odor gases is predicting the production of odors from domestic waste. In this study, four factors of domestic waste (weight, wet composition, temperature, and fermentation time) were adopted to be the prediction indicators in the prediction for domestic waste odor gases. Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were established using the odor intensity values of 512 odor gases from domestic waste. Based on these data, the regression prediction with supervised machine learning was achieved, in which three different algorithmic models were evaluated for prediction performance. A Random Forest model with a R value of 0.8958 demonstrated the most accurate prediction of the production of domestic waste odor gas based on our data. Furthermore, the prediction results in the Random Forest model were further discussed based on the microbial fermentation of domestic waste. In addition to enhancing our knowledge of the production of odor from domestic waste, we also explore the application of machine learning to odor pollution in our study.",

Here we conduct unsupervised training on more than 20,000 human normal and tumor transcriptomic data and show that the resulting Deep-Autoencoder, DeepT2Vec, has successfully extracted informative features and embedded transcriptomes into 30-dimensional Transcriptomic Feature Vectors (TFVs). We demonstrate that the TFVs could recapitulate expression patterns and be used to track tissue origins. Trained on these extracted features only, a supervised classifier, DeepC, can effectively distinguish tumors from normal samples with an accuracy of 90% for Pan-Cancer and reach an average 94% for specific cancers. Training on a connected network, the accuracy is further increased to 96% for Pan-Cancer. Together, our study shows that deep learning with autoencoder is suitable for transcriptomic analysis, and DeepT2Vec could be successfully applied to distinguish cancers, normal tissues, and other potential traits with limited samples.",

    "title": "Acoustic emission corrosion feature extraction and severity prediction using hybrid wavelet packet transform and linear support vector classifier.",
    "abstract": "Corrosion in carbon-steel pipelines leads to failure, which is a major cause of breakdown maintenance in the oil and gas industries. The acoustic emission (AE) signal is a reliable method for corrosion detection and classification in the modern Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system. The efficiency of this system in detection and classification mainly depends on the suitable AE features. Therefore, many feature extraction and classification methods have been developed for corrosion detection and severity assessment. However, the extraction of appropriate AE features and classification of various levels of corrosion utilizing these extracted features are still challenging issues. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a hybrid machine learning approach that combines Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) integrated with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for multiresolution feature extraction and Linear Support Vector Classifier (L-SVC) for predicting corrosion severity levels. A Laboratory-based Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) test was performed on carbon-steel samples for AE data acquisition over a different time span. AE signals were collected at a high sampling rate with a sound well AE sensor using AEWin software. Simulation results show a linear relationship between the proposed approach-based extracted AE features and the corrosion process. For multi-class problems, three corrosion severity stages have been made based on the corrosion rate over time and AE activity. The ANOVA test results indicate the significance within and between the feature-groups where F-values (F-value>1) rejects the null hypothesis and P-values (P-value<0.05) are less than the significance level. The utilized L-SVC classifier achieves higher prediction accuracy of 99.0% than the accuracy of other benchmarked classifiers. Findings of our proposed machine learning approach confirm that it can be effectively utilized for corrosion detection and severity assessment in SHM applications.",

Early prediction can significantly diminish the potential jeopardy and severity of diabetes. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to predict whether an unknown sample had diabetes or not. However, the main significance of this research was to provide a clinical decision support system (CDSS) by predicting type 2 diabetes using different ML algorithms. For the research purpose, the publicly available Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset was used. Data preprocessing, K-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and various ML classifiers such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and histogram-based gradient boosting (HBGB) were used. Several scaling methods were also used to improve the accuracy of the result. For further research, a rule-based approach was used to escalate the effectiveness of the system. After that, the accuracy of DT and HBGB was above 90%. Based on this result, the CDSS was implemented where users can give the required input parameters through a web-based user interface to get decision support with some analytical results for the individual patient. The CDSS, which was implemented, will be beneficial for physicians and patients to make decisions about diabetes diagnosis and offer real-time analysis-based suggestions to improve medical quality. For future work, if daily data of a diabetic patient can be put together, then a better clinical support system can be implemented for daily decision support for patients worldwide.",

APLs are synthesized as precursors or propeptides that undergo self-cleavage through autoproteolytic reaction.

Recognizing their critical roles in many biological processes including virus maturation, and virulence, accurate identification and characterization of APLs is indispensable. Experimental identification and characterization of APLs is laborious and time-consuming. Here, we developed APLpred, a novel support vector machine (SVM) based predictor that can predict APLs from the primary sequences. APLpred was developed using Boruta-based optimal features derived from seven encodings and subsequently trained using five machine learning algorithms. After evaluating each model on an independent dataset, we selected APLpred (an SVM-based model) due to its consistent performance during cross-validation and independent evaluation. We anticipate APLpred will be an effective tool for identifying APLs. This could aid in designing inhibitors against these enzymes and exploring their functions.

Machine learning technology is employed to build a system for evaluating and predicting the rationality of clinical drug combinations based on &quot;drug characteristics-repository information-artificial intelligence&quot; strategy, which will be debugged and validated in multi-center clinical practice, with a view to providing new ideas and technical references for the safety and efficacy of clinical drug use.",

    "abstract": "Host population structure is a key determinant of pathogen and infectious disease transmission patterns. Pathogen phylogenetic trees are useful tools to reveal the population structure underlying an epidemic. Determining whether a population is structured or not is useful in informing the type of phylogenetic methods to be used in a given study. We employ tree statistics derived from phylogenetic trees and machine learning classification techniques to reveal an underlying population structure. In this paper, we simulate phylogenetic trees from both structured and non-structured host populations. We compute eight statistics for the simulated trees, which are: the number of cherries; Sackin, Colless and total cophenetic indices; ladder length; maximum depth; maximum width, and width-to-depth ratio. Based on the estimated tree statistics, we classify the simulated trees as from either a non-structured or a structured population using the decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We incorporate the basic reproductive number ([Formula: see text]) in our tree simulation procedure. Sensitivity analysis is done to investigate whether the classifiers are robust to different choice of model parameters and to size of trees. Cross-validated results for area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves yield mean values of over 0.9 for most of the classification models. Our classification procedure distinguishes well between trees from structured and non-structured populations using the classifiers, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cucconi and Podgor-Gastwirth tests and the box plots. SVM models were more robust to changes in model parameters and tree size compared to KNN and DT classifiers. Our classification procedure was applied to real -world data and the structured population was revealed with high accuracy of [Formula: see text] using SVM-polynomial classifier.",

Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre-surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) has been widely studied for its potential to enhance cognitive functions of the elderly. However, its efficacy varies, with some individuals exhibiting no significant response to the treatment. Considering these inconsistencies, we introduce a machine learning approach aimed at distinguishing between individuals that respond and do not respond to tPBM treatment based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) acquired before the treatment. We measured nine cognitive scores and recorded fNIRS data from 62 older adults with cognitive decline (43 experimental and 19 control subjects). The experimental group underwent tPBM intervention over a span of 12 weeks. Based on the comparison of the global cognitive score (GCS), merging the nine cognitive scores into a single representation, acquired before and after tPBM treatment, we classified all participants as responders or non-responders to tPBM with a threshold for the GCS change. The fNIRS data were recorded during the resting state, recognition memory task (RMT), Stroop task, and verbal fluency task. A regularized support vector machine was utilized to classify the responders and non-responders to tPBM. The most promising performance of our machine learning model was observed when using the fNIRS data collected during the RMT, which yielded an accuracy of 0.8537, an F1-score of 0.8421, sensitivity of 0.7619, and specificity of 0.95. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the tPBM efficacy. Our approach is expected to contribute to more efficient treatment planning by excluding ineffective treatment options.",

    "title": "Highly Efficient Framework for Predicting Interactions Between Proteins.",
    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in many biological processes. Although a large amount of human PPI data has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, they are very limited compared to the estimated 130 000 protein interactions in humans. Hence, automatic methods for human PPI-detection are highly desired. This work proposes a novel framework, i.e., Low-rank approximation-kernel Extreme Learning Machine (LELM), for detecting human PPI from a protein's primary sequences automatically. It has three main steps: 1) mapping each protein sequence into a matrix built on all kinds of adjacent amino acids; 2) applying the low-rank approximation model to the obtained matrix to solve its lowest rank representation, which reflects its true subspace structures; and 3) utilizing a powerful kernel extreme learning machine to predict the probability for PPI based on this lowest rank representation. Experimental results on a large-scale human PPI dataset demonstrate that the proposed LELM has significant advantages in accuracy and efficiency over the state-of-art approaches. Hence, this work establishes a new and effective way for the automatic detection of PPI.",

The majority of these proposed solutions for countering the aforementioned actions (C-UAS) include radar/RF/EO/IR/acoustic sensors, usually working in coordination. This work introduces a small UAS (sUAS) acoustic detection system based on an array of microphones, easily deployable and with moderate cost. It continuously collects audio data and enables (a) the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of the most prominent incoming acoustic signal by implementing a straightforward algorithmic process similar to triangulation and (b) identification, i.e., confirmation that the incoming acoustic signal actually emanates from a UAS, by exploiting sound spectrograms using machine-learning (ML) techniques. Extensive outdoor experimental sessions have validated this system's efficacy for reliable UAS detection at distances exceeding 70 m.",

This study aims to review and analyze research from the past decade on the potential of EEG signals in SA detection and classification focusing on various deep learning and machine learning techniques, including signal decomposition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification methodologies. A systematic literature review using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and PICO guidelines was conducted across 5 databases for publications from January 2010 to December 2024. The review involved screening a total of 402 papers, with 63 selected for in-depth analysis to provide valuable insights into the application of EEG signals for SA detection. The findings underscore the potential of EEG-based methods in improving SA diagnosis. This study provides valuable insights, showcasing significant advancements while identifying key areas for further exploration, thereby laying a strong foundation for future research in EEG-based SA detection.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 has imposed clinical and financial burdens on hospitals and governments attempting to provide patients with medical care and implement disease-controlling policies. The transmissibility of the disease was shown to be correlated with the patient's viral load, which can be measured during testing using the cycle threshold (Ct). Previous models have utilized Ct to forecast the trajectory of the spread, which can provide valuable information to better allocate resources and change policies. However, these models combined other variables specific to medical institutions or came in the form of compartmental models that rely on epidemiological assumptions, all of which could impose prediction uncertainties. In this study, we overcome these limitations using data-driven modeling that utilizes Ct and previous number of cases, two institution-independent variables. We collected three groups of patients (n = 6296, n = 3228, and n = 12,096) from different time periods to train, validate, and independently validate the models. We used three machine learning algorithms and three deep learning algorithms that can model the temporal dynamic behavior of the number of cases. The endpoint was 7-week forward number of cases, and the prediction was evaluated using mean square error (MSE). The sequence-to-sequence model showed the best prediction during validation (MSE = 0.025), while polynomial regression (OLS) and support vector machine regression (SVR) had better performance during independent validation (MSE = 0.1596, and MSE = 0.16754, respectively), which exhibited better generalizability of the latter. The OLS and SVR models were used on a dataset from an external institution and showed promise in predicting COVID-19 incidences across institutions. These models may support clinical and logistic decision-making after prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection and ranking is of great importance in the analysis of biomedical data. In addition to reducing the number of features used in classification or other machine learning tasks, it allows us to extract meaningful biological and medical information from a machine learning model. Most existing approaches in this domain do not directly model the fact that the relative importance of features can be different in different regions of the feature space. In this work, we present a context aware feature ranking algorithm called CAFÉ-Map. CAFÉ-Map is a locally linear feature ranking framework that allows recognition of important features in any given region of the feature space or for any individual example. This allows for simultaneous classification and feature ranking in an interpretable manner. We have benchmarked CAFÉ-Map on a number of toy and real world biomedical data sets. Our comparative study with a number of published methods shows that CAFÉ-Map achieves better accuracies on these data sets. The top ranking features obtained through CAFÉ-Map in a gene profiling study correlate very well with the importance of different genes reported in the literature. Furthermore, CAFÉ-Map provides a more in-depth analysis of feature ranking at the level of individual examples. CAFÉ-Map Python code is available at: http://faculty.pieas.edu.pk/fayyaz/software.html#cafemap . The CAFÉ-Map package supports parallelization and sparse data and provides example scripts for classification. This code can be used to reconstruct the results given in this paper.",

    "title": "Leveraging Eye Tracking to Prioritize Relevant Medical Record Data: Comparative Machine Learning Study.",
    "abstract": "Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture large amounts of data per patient and present that data to physicians with little prioritization. Without prioritization, physicians must mentally identify and collate relevant data, an activity that can lead to cognitive overload. To mitigate cognitive overload, a Learning EMR (LEMR) system prioritizes the display of relevant medical record data. Relevant data are those that are pertinent to a context-defined as the combination of the user, clinical task, and patient case. To determine which data are relevant in a specific context, a LEMR system uses supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. Since obtaining information-seeking behavior data via manual annotation is slow and expensive, automatic methods for capturing such data are needed. The goal of the research was to propose and evaluate eye tracking as a high-throughput method to automatically acquire physician information-seeking behavior useful for training models for a LEMR system. Critical care medicine physicians reviewed intensive care unit patient cases in an EMR interface developed for the study. Participants manually identified patient data that were relevant in the context of a clinical task: preparing a patient summary to present at morning rounds. We used eye tracking to capture each physician's gaze dwell time on each data item (eg, blood glucose measurements). Manual annotations and gaze dwell times were used to define target variables for developing supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. We compared the performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on an independent set of patient cases. A total of 68 pairs of manual selection and gaze-derived machine learning models were developed from training data and evaluated on an independent evaluation data set. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed similar performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P=.40). We used eye tracking to automatically capture physician information-seeking behavior and used it to train models for a LEMR system. The models that were trained using eye tracking performed like models that were trained using manual annotations. These results support further development of eye tracking as a high-throughput method for training clinical decision support systems that prioritize the display of relevant medical record data.",

This article gives an overview of the exciting and dynamic field of machine learning and serves as an introduction to some methods primarily from the realm of supervised learning. In addition to definitions and simple examples, limitations are discussed. The basic principles behind the methods are simple.

Through comparative experiments on microblog data about the \"July 20 heavy rainstorm in Zhengzhou\" posted on China's largest social media platform, we find that the MRIM performs better than pure machine learning methods and pure rule-based methods, and that its performance is influenced by microblog characteristics such as the number of words, exact address and contact information, and users' attention. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating machine learning and rule-based methods to mine the text of social media UGCs and provides actionable suggestions for emergency information management practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Multilabel classification (MLC) is a machine learning task where the goal is to learn to label an example with multiple labels simultaneously. It receives increasing interest from the machine learning community, as evidenced by the increasing number of papers and methods that appear in the literature. Hence, ensuring proper, correct, robust, and trustworthy benchmarking is of utmost importance for the further development of the field. We believe that this can be achieved by adhering to the recently emerged data management standards, such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and TRUST (Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology) principles. We introduce an ontology-based online catalogue of MLC datasets originating from various application domains following these principles. The catalogue extensively describes many MLC datasets with comprehensible meta-features, MLC-specific semantic descriptions, and different data provenance information. The MLC data catalogue is available at: http://semantichub.ijs.si/MLCdatasets .",

    "title": "FLAN: feature-wise latent additive neural models for biological applications.",
    "abstract": "Interpretability has become a necessary feature for machine learning models deployed in critical scenarios, e.g. legal system, healthcare. In these situations, algorithmic decisions may have (potentially negative) long-lasting effects on the end-user affected by the decision. While deep learning models achieve impressive results, they often function as a black-box. Inspired by linear models, we propose a novel class of structurally constrained deep neural networks, which we call FLAN (Feature-wise Latent Additive Networks). Crucially, FLANs process each input feature separately, computing for each of them a representation in a common latent space. These feature-wise latent representations are then simply summed, and the aggregated representation is used for the prediction. These feature-wise representations allow a user to estimate the effect of each individual feature independently from the others, similarly to the way linear models are interpreted. We demonstrate FLAN on a series of benchmark datasets in different biological domains. Our experiments show that FLAN achieves good performances even in complex datasets (e.g. TCR-epitope binding prediction), despite the structural constraint we imposed. On the other hand, this constraint enables us to interpret FLAN by deciphering its decision process, as well as obtaining biological insights (e.g. by identifying the marker genes of different cell populations). In supplementary experiments, we show similar performances also on non-biological datasets. Code and example data are available at https://github.com/phineasng/flan_bio.",

    "abstract": "Nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry screening (NTS HRMS/MS) can detect thousands of organic substances in environmental samples. However, new strategies are needed to focus time-intensive identification efforts on features with the highest potential to cause adverse effects instead of the most abundant ones. To address this challenge, we developed MLinvitroTox, a machine learning framework that uses molecular fingerprints derived from fragmentation spectra (MS2) for a rapid classification of thousands of unidentified HRMS/MS features as toxic/nontoxic based on nearly 400 target-specific and over 100 cytotoxic endpoints from ToxCast/Tox21. Model development results demonstrated that using customized molecular fingerprints and models, over a quarter of toxic endpoints and the majority of the associated mechanistic targets could be accurately predicted with sensitivities exceeding 0.95. Notably, SIRIUS molecular fingerprints and xboost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) models with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for handling data imbalance were a universally successful and robust modeling configuration. Validation of MLinvitroTox on MassBank spectra showed that toxicity could be predicted from molecular fingerprints derived from MS2 with an average balanced accuracy of 0.75. By applying MLinvitroTox to environmental HRMS/MS data, we confirmed the experimental results obtained with target analysis and narrowed the analytical focus from tens of thousands of detected signals to 783 features linked to potential toxicity, including 109 spectral matches and 30 compounds with confirmed toxic activity.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a disorder that if not treated can hamper the quality of life. EEG has shown great promise in detecting depressed individuals from depression control individuals. It overcomes the limitations of traditional questionnaire-based methods. In this study, a machine learning-based method for detecting depression among young adults using EEG data recorded by the wireless headset is proposed. For this reason, EEG data has been recorded using an Emotiv Epoc+ headset. A total of 32 young adults participated and the PHQ9 screening tool was used to identify depressed participants. Features such as skewness, kurtosis, variance, Hjorth parameters, Shannon entropy, and Log energy entropy from 1 to 5 sec data filtered at different band frequencies were applied to KNN and SVM classifiers with different kernels. At AB band (8-30 Hz) frequency, 98.43 ± 0.15% accuracy was achieved by extracting Hjorth parameters, Shannon entropy, and Log energy entropy from 5 sec samples with a 5-fold CV using a KNN classifier. And with the same features and classifier overall accuracy = 98.10 ± 0.11, NPV = 0.977, precision = 0.984, sensitivity = 0.984, specificity = 0.976, and F1 score = 0.984 was achieved after splitting the data to 70/30 ratio for training and testing with 5-fold CV. From the findings, it can be concluded that EEG data from an Emotiv headset can be used to detect depression with the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Net benefit is the most widely used metric for evaluating the clinical utility of medical prediction models. The approach applies decision analytic theory to weight true and false positives depending on the relative consequences of different decision outcomes. It is plausible that there are at least some machine learning scenarios where optimization of the objective function during model development will not optimize net benefit during model evaluation. We therefore hypothesize that optimizing net benefit during model development will in some cases ultimately lead to higher clinical utility than optimizing for mean square error or some other unweighted loss function. There is some preliminary evidence that this does indeed occur. We accordingly recommend further methodologic research to determine the use cases where net benefit should be the objective function during model development.",

While existing studies have examined the macroscopic role of GF, few pay attention to its impact on micro-enterprises. To investigate the effect of GF on micro-enterprises, this study considers green credit as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the effect on firms' green total factor productivity (GTFP). We use the SBM-Malmquist method to measure firms' GTFP and adopt the double dual machine learning approach to explore its impact and potential mechanisms. The findings indicate that (1) the GF can effectively promote the GTFP at the firm level, which has been reconfirmed by robustness tests. (2) The GF can improve firms' GTFP through three pathways: promoting firms' green innovation, alleviating financing constraints, and strengthening managers' environmental concerns. (3). The heterogeneity analysis verifies that state-owned enterprises and large-size firms are more sensitive to the response of green finance. The results of this study lend support to the establishment of green finance and the formulation of corporate green development strategies.",

    "title": "AVNM: A Voting based Novel Mathematical Rule for Image Classification.",
    "abstract": "In machine learning, the accuracy of the system depends upon classification result. Classification accuracy plays an imperative role in various domains. Non-parametric classifier like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is the most widely used classifier for pattern analysis. Besides its easiness, simplicity and effectiveness characteristics, the main problem associated with KNN classifier is the selection of a number of nearest neighbors i.e. \"k\" for computation. At present, it is hard to find the optimal value of \"k\" using any statistical algorithm, which gives perfect accuracy in terms of low misclassification error rate. Motivated by the prescribed problem, a new sample space reduction weighted voting mathematical rule (AVNM) is proposed for classification in machine learning. The proposed AVNM rule is also non-parametric in nature like KNN. AVNM uses the weighted voting mechanism with sample space reduction to learn and examine the predicted class label for unidentified sample. AVNM is free from any initial selection of predefined variable and neighbor selection as found in KNN algorithm. The proposed classifier also reduces the effect of outliers. To verify the performance of the proposed AVNM classifier, experiments are made on 10 standard datasets taken from UCI database and one manually created dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed AVNM rule outperforms the KNN classifier and its variants. Experimentation results based on confusion matrix accuracy parameter proves higher accuracy value with AVNM rule. The proposed AVNM rule is based on sample space reduction mechanism for identification of an optimal number of nearest neighbor selections. AVNM results in better classification accuracy and minimum error rate as compared with the state-of-art algorithm, KNN, and its variants. The proposed rule automates the selection of nearest neighbor selection and improves classification rate for UCI dataset and manually created dataset.",

    "abstract": "is to train and test an ensemble of machine learning models, as well as to compare its performance with the BERT language model pre-trained on medical data to perform simple binary classification, i.e., determine the presence/absence of the signs of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in brain CT reports. Seven machine learning algorithms and three text vectorization techniques were selected as models to solve the binary classification problem. These models were trained on textual data represented by 3980 brain CT reports from 56 inpatient medical facilities in Moscow. The study utilized three text vectorization techniques: bag of words, TF-IDF, and word2vec. The resulting data were then processed by the following machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, nearest neighbors, support vector machines, Catboost, and XGboost. Data analysis and pre-processing were performed using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit, version 3.6.5), libraries for character-based and statistical processing of natural language, and Scikit-learn (version 0.24.2), a library for machine learning containing tools to tackle classification challenges. MedRuBertTiny2 was taken as a BERT transformer model pre-trained on medical data. Based on the training and testing outcomes from seven machine learning algorithms, the authors selected three algorithms that yielded the highest metrics (i.e. sensitivity and specificity): CatBoost, logistic regression, and nearest neighbors. The highest metrics were achieved by the bag of words technique. These algorithms were assembled into an ensemble using the stacking technique. The sensitivity and specificity for the validation dataset separated from the original sample were 0.93 and 0.90, respectively. Next, the ensemble and the BERT model were trained on an independent dataset containing 9393 textual radiology reports also divided into training and test sets. Once the ensemble was tested on this dataset, the resulting sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 and 0.90, respectively. The BERT model tested on these data demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.90. When analyzing textual reports of brain CT scans with signs of intracranial hemorrhage, the trained ensemble demonstrated high accuracy metrics. Still, manual quality control of the results is required during its application. The pre-trained BERT transformer model, additionally trained on diagnostic textual reports, demonstrated higher accuracy metrics (p<0.05). The results show promise in terms of finding specific values for both binary classification task and in-depth analysis of unstructured medical information.",

Applying dynamical systems theory to the machine learning solution further provides a pathway to interpret the results. Using random forest models as an illustrative example, these models were able to recover the temporal dynamics of time series data simulated using a modified Cusp Catastrophe Monte Carlo. By extracting the points of no change (set points) and the predicted changes surrounding the set points, it is possible to characterize the topology of the system, both for systems governed by global equation forms and complex adaptive systems. RESULTS: The model for the simulation was able to recover the cusp catastrophe (i.e. the qualitative changes in the dynamics of the system) even when applied to data that have a significant amount of error variance. To further illustrate the approach, a real-world accelerometer example was examined, where the model differentiated between movement dynamics patterns by identifying set points related to cyclic motion during walking and attraction during stair climbing. These example findings suggest that integrating machine learning with dynamical systems modeling provides a viable means for classifying distinct temporal patterns, even when there is no governing equation for the nonlinear dynamics. Results of these integrated models yield solutions with both a prediction of where the system is going next and a decomposition of the topological features implied by the temporal dynamics.",

In this study, a new rolling bearing data generation method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can be trained adversarially and jointly via a learned embedding, and applied to solve fault diagnosis problems with insufficient data. By analyzing the time-domain characteristics of rolling bearing life cycle monitoring data in actual working conditions, the operation data are divided into three periods, and the construction and training of the generative adversarial network model are carried out.

We summarize the prediction problems and methodological landscape and determine whether using text data in addition to more commonly used structured data improves the prediction performance. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies that developed prognostic prediction models using information extracted from unstructured text in a data-driven manner, published in the period from January 2005 to March 2021. Data items were extracted, analyzed, and a meta-analysis of the model performance was carried out to assess the added value of text to structured-data models. We identified 126 studies that described 145 clinical prediction problems. Combining text and structured data improved model performance, compared with using only text or only structured data. In these studies, a wide variety of dense and sparse numeric text representations were combined with both deep learning and more traditional machine learning methods. External validation, public availability, and attention for the explainability of the developed models were limited. The use of unstructured text in the development of prognostic prediction models has been found beneficial in addition to structured data in most studies. The text data are source of valuable information for prediction model development and should not be neglected. We suggest a future focus on explainability and external validation of the developed models, promoting robust and trustworthy prediction models in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of sleep is important for the diagnosis of sleep disorders and sleep research. However, the only widely accepted method to obtain sleep staging is by visual analysis of polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive and time consuming. Here, we investigate automated sleep scoring based on a low-cost, mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) platform consisting of a lightweight EEG amplifier combined with flex-printed cEEGrid electrodes placed around the ear, which can be implemented as a fully self-applicable sleep system. However, cEEGrid signals have different amplitude characteristics to normal scalp PSG signals, which might be challenging for visual scoring. Therefore, this study evaluates the potential of automatic scoring of cEEGrid signals using a machine learning classifier (\"random forests\") and compares its performance with manual scoring of standard PSG. In addition, the automatic scoring of cEEGrid signals is compared with manual annotation of the cEEGrid recording and with simultaneous actigraphy. Acceptable recordings were obtained in 15 healthy volunteers (aged 35 ± 14.3 years) during an extended nocturnal sleep opportunity, which induced disrupted sleep with a large inter-individual variation in sleep parameters. The results demonstrate that machine-learning-based scoring of around-the-ear EEG outperforms actigraphy with respect to sleep onset and total sleep time assessments. The automated scoring outperforms human scoring of cEEGrid by standard criteria. The accuracy of machine-learning-based automated scoring of cEEGrid sleep recordings compared with manual scoring of standard PSG was satisfactory. The findings show that cEEGrid recordings combined with machine-learning-based scoring holds promise for large-scale sleep studies.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence in drug combination therapy.",
    "abstract": "Currently, the development of medicines for complex diseases requires the development of combination drug therapies. It is necessary because in many cases, one drug cannot target all necessary points of intervention. For example, in cancer therapy, a physician often meets a patient having a genomic profile including more than five molecular aberrations. Drug combination therapy has been an area of interest for a while, for example the classical work of Loewe devoted to the synergism of drugs was published in 1928-and it is still used in calculations for optimal drug combinations. More recently, over the past several years, there has been an explosion in the available information related to the properties of drugs and the biomedical parameters of patients. For the drugs, hundreds of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors for medicines are now available, while for patients, large data sets related to genetic/proteomic and metabolomics profiles of the patients are now available, as well as the more traditional data relating to the histology, history of treatments, pretreatment state of the organism, etc. Moreover, during disease progression, the genetic profile can change. Thus, the ability to optimize drug combinations for each patient is rapidly moving beyond the comprehension and capabilities of an individual physician. This is the reason, that biomedical informatics methods have been developed and one of the more promising directions in this field is the application of artificial intelligence (AI). In this review, we discuss several AI methods that have been successfully implemented in several instances of combination drug therapy from HIV, hypertension, infectious diseases to cancer. The data clearly show that the combination of rule-based expert systems with machine learning algorithms may be promising direction in this field.",

    "title": "Application of unsupervised machine learning to identify areas of blood product wastage in transfusion medicine.",
    "abstract": "Wastage of blood products can be a significant cost to blood banks. However, the cause of wastage is often complex and makes it difficult to determine wastage-associated factors. Machine learning techniques may be useful tools to investigate these complex associations. We investigated whether unsupervised machine learning can identify patterns associated with wastage in our blood bank. Data on red blood cells, platelets and frozen products were obtained from the laboratory information system of the Central Zone Blood Transfusion Services at Nova Scotia Health Authority. A total of 879 532 transactions were analysed by association rule mining, a type of machine learning algorithm. Associations with lift scores greater than 25 and with clinical relevance were flagged for further examination. Association rule mining returned a total of 3355 associations related to wastage. Several notable associations were identified. For example, certain wards were associated with wastage due to thawing unused frozen products. Other examples included association between smaller blood banks and evening work shifts with product wastage due to excess time outside the laboratory or returning products with high temperatures. This paper demonstrates the effective use of unsupervised machine learning for the purpose of investigating wastage in a large blood bank. The use of association rule mining was able to identify wastage factors, which can help guide quality improvement initiatives. This technique can be automated to provide rapid analysis of complex associations contributing to wastage and could be utilized in modern blood banks.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which presents itself as an inability to initiate or continue gait. This paper presents a method to monitor FOG episodes based only on acceleration measurements obtained from a waist-worn device. Three approximations of this method are tested. Initially, FOG is directly detected by a support vector machine (SVM). Then, classifier's outputs are aggregated over time to determine a confidence value, which is used for the final classification of freezing (i.e., second and third approach). All variations are trained with signals of 15 patients and evaluated with signals from another 5 patients. Using a linear SVM kernel, the third approach provides 98.7% accuracy and a geometric mean of 96.1%. Moreover, it is investigated whether frequency features are enough to reliably detect FOG. Results show that these features allow the method to detect FOG with accuracies above 90% and that frequency features enable a reliable monitoring of FOG by using simply a waist sensor.",

    "title": "Combining Cloud-Based Free-Energy Calculations, Synthetically Aware Enumerations, and Goal-Directed Generative Machine Learning for Rapid Large-Scale Chemical Exploration and Optimization.",
    "abstract": "The hit identification process usually involves the profiling of millions to more recently billions of compounds either via traditional experimental high-throughput screens (HTS) or computational virtual high-throughput screens (vHTS). We have previously demonstrated that, by coupling reaction-based enumeration, active learning, and free energy calculations, a similarly large-scale exploration of chemical space can be extended to the hit-to-lead process. In this work, we augment that approach by coupling large scale enumeration and cloud-based free energy perturbation (FEP) profiling with goal-directed generative machine learning, which results in a higher enrichment of potent ideas compared to large scale enumeration alone, while simultaneously staying within the bounds of predefined drug-like property space. We can achieve this by building the molecular distribution for generative machine learning from the PathFinder rules-based enumeration and optimizing for a weighted sum QSAR-based multiparameter optimization function. We examine the utility of this combined approach by designing potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and demonstrate a coupled workflow that can (1) provide a 6.4-fold enrichment improvement in identifying <10 nM compounds over random selection and a 1.5-fold enrichment in identifying <10 nM compounds over our previous method, (2) rapidly explore relevant chemical space outside the bounds of commercial reagents, (3) use generative ML approaches to \"learn\" the SAR from large scale in silico enumerations and generate novel idea molecules for a flexible receptor site that are both potent and within relevant physicochemical space, and (4) produce over 3 000 000 idea molecules and run 1935 FEP simulations, identifying 69 ideas with a predicted IC < 10 nM and 358 ideas with a predicted IC < 100 nM. The reported data suggest combining both reaction-based and generative machine learning for ideation results in a higher enrichment of potent compounds over previously described approaches and has the potential to rapidly accelerate the discovery of novel chemical matter within a predefined potency and property space.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can not only classify images but can also generate key features, e.g., the Google neural network that learned to identify cats by simply watching YouTube videos, for the classification. In this paper, crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth, a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study, three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets (case 1) and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis (case 2) or cool summer damage (case 3). The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice, which was implemented in the crop model, simply by learning. Moreover, CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility, cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover, the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of healthcare data becomes a tedious task as large volume of unlabelled information is generated. In this article, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity involved in analysis of healthcare data. The proposed algorithm predicts the health status of elderly from the data collected at health centres by utilizing PCA (principle component analysis) and SVM (support vector machine) algorithms. The performance of proposed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with well-known methods like quadratic Discriminant, linear Discriminant, logistic regression, KNN weighted and SVM medium Gaussian using F-measure. At that point, the pre-prepared information is subjected to the dimensionality decrease process by playing out the Feature Selection errand. So, chosen component analysis are investigated by the proposed work SVM-based enhanced recursive element determination, and its precision is assessed and contrasted with the other customary classifiers, for example, quadratic Discriminant, Linear Discriminant, Logistic Regression, KNN Weighted and SVM Medium Gaussian. Here, we built up a shrewd versatile information module for the remote procurement and transmission of EHR (Electronic Health Record) chronicles, together with an online watcher for showing the EHR datasets on a PC, advanced cell or tablet. So as to characterize the highlights required by clients, we demonstrated the elderly checking system in home and healing facility settings.

    "abstract": "Disease risk prediction is a rising challenge in the medical domain. Researchers have widely used machine learning algorithms to solve this challenge. The k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm is the most frequently used among the wide range of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a study on different KNN variants (Classic one, Adaptive, Locally adaptive, k-means clustering, Fuzzy, Mutual, Ensemble, Hassanat and Generalised mean distance) and their performance comparison for disease prediction. This study analysed these variants in-depth through implementations and experimentations using eight machine learning benchmark datasets obtained from Kaggle, UCI Machine learning repository and OpenML. The datasets were related to different disease contexts. We considered the performance measures of accuracy, precision and recall for comparative analysis. The average accuracy values of these variants ranged from 64.22% to 83.62%. The Hassanaat KNN showed the highest average accuracy (83.62%), followed by the ensemble approach KNN (82.34%). A relative performance index is also proposed based on each performance measure to assess each variant and compare the results. This study identified Hassanat KNN as the best performing variant based on the accuracy-based version of this index, followed by the ensemble approach KNN. This study also provided a relative comparison among KNN variants based on precision and recall measures. Finally, this paper summarises which KNN variant is the most promising candidate to follow under the consideration of three performance measures (accuracy, precision and recall) for disease prediction. Healthcare researchers and stakeholders could use the findings of this study to select the appropriate KNN variant for predictive disease risk analytics.",

    "abstract": "Supersaturation of total dissolved gas (TDG) caused by high dam discharge is an ecological risk that cannot be ignored in the operation of hydropower stations. The establishment of an efficient and concise TDG generation prediction model is of great significance to the water ecology and water environment protection of hydropower development reaches. The flow conditions and the process of water-gas mass transfer in discharge and energy dissipation are very complicated and difficult to observe in the field, bringing difficulties to the establishment of prediction model and parameter calibration. Increasingly abundant observations make it possible to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated TDG. In this study, extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector regression (SVR) were used to establish the prediction model. The main influencing factors of supersaturated TDG, obtained by the analysis of the physical process of the generation of supersaturated TDG, were used as the input of the machine learning model. Then, this research took Dagangshan hydropower station and Xiluodu hydropower station as objects, and established machine learning prediction model for supersaturated TDG with several years of observation data in different discharge scenarios. Four models, including ELM, SVR, GA-ELM and GA-SVR, were obtained through genetic algorithm optimization. The relative errors of the simulation results of each model are mostly less than 5%, mean absolute error (MAE) values less than 1.6%, and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than 2.5%. The results showed that these models are highly accurate and time-saving. Based on this, TDG saturation in downstream of Dagangshan hydropower station with different discharge scenarios was simulated by machine learning model, on which the discharge optimization scheme was put forward. The proposed models, as an important supplement to the prediction of supersaturated TDG, enjoy practical significance and engineering value.",

Neural network algorithm and prediction model were used in this paper for the study and exploration of English grammar. Aiming at the application requirements of English grammar accuracy and standardization, we proposed a machine learning model based on LSTM-CRF to detect and analyze English grammar. This paper briefly summarized the development trend of deep learning and neural network algorithm and designed the structure pattern of radial basis function neural network in grammar semantic detection and analysis on the basis of deep learning artificial neural network theory. Based on the morphological features of English grammar, a grammar database was established according to the rules of English word segmentation. In this paper, we proposed an improved conditional random field CRF (Conditional Random Field) network model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It can improve the problem that the traditional machine learning model relies on feature point selection in English grammar detection. The machine learning model based on LSTM-CRF was used to recognize English grammar text entities. The results show that the English grammar detection system based on the LSTM-CRF model can simplify the process structure in the recognition process, reduce the unnecessary operation cycle, and improve the overall detection accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) effectively mitigates the data silo challenge brought about by policies and privacy concerns, implicitly harnessing more data for deep model training. However, traditional centralized FL models grapple with diverse multi-center data, especially in the face of significant data heterogeneity, notably in medical contexts. In the realm of medical image segmentation, the growing imperative to curtail annotation costs has amplified the importance of weakly-supervised techniques which utilize sparse annotations such as points, scribbles, etc. A pragmatic FL paradigm shall accommodate diverse annotation formats across different sites, which research topic remains under-investigated. In such context, we propose a novel personalized FL framework with learnable prompt and aggregation (FedLPPA) to uniformly leverage heterogeneous weak supervision for medical image segmentation. In FedLPPA, a learnable universal knowledge prompt is maintained, complemented by multiple learnable personalized data distribution prompts and prompts representing the supervision sparsity. Integrated with sample features through a dual-attention mechanism, those prompts empower each local task decoder to adeptly adjust to both the local distribution and the supervision form. Concurrently, a dual-decoder strategy, predicated on prompt similarity, is introduced for enhancing the generation of pseudo-labels in weakly-supervised learning, alleviating overfitting and noise accumulation inherent to local data, while an adaptable aggregation method is employed to customize the task decoder on a parameter-wise basis. Extensive experiments on four distinct medical image segmentation tasks involving different modalities underscore the superiority of FedLPPA, with its efficacy closely parallels that of fully supervised centralized training.

    "abstract": "The need for intubation in methanol-poisoned patients, if not predicted in time, can lead to irreparable complications and even death. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) greatly aid in accurately predicting intubation needs for methanol-poisoned patients. So, our study aims to assess Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for predicting intubation necessity in methanol-poisoned patients, comparing deep learning and machine learning models. This study analyzed a dataset of 897 patient records from Loghman Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran, encompassing cases of methanol poisoning, including those requiring intubation (202 cases) and those not requiring it (695 cases). Eight established ML (SVM, XGB, DT, RF) and DL (DNN, FNN, LSTM, CNN) models were used. Techniques such as tenfold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were applied to prevent overfitting. The study also focused on interpretability through SHAP and LIME methods. Model performance was evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics. Among DL models, LSTM showed superior performance in accuracy (94.0%), sensitivity (99.0%), specificity (94.0%), and F1-score (97.0%). CNN led in ROC with 78.0%. For ML models, RF excelled in accuracy (97.0%) and specificity (100%), followed by XGB with sensitivity (99.37%), F1-score (98.27%), and ROC (96.08%). Overall, RF and XGB outperformed other models, with accuracy (97.0%) and specificity (100%) for RF, and sensitivity (99.37%), F1-score (98.27%), and ROC (96.08%) for XGB. ML models surpassed DL models across all metrics, with accuracies from 93.0% to 97.0% for DL and 93.0% to 99.0% for ML. Sensitivities ranged from 98.0% to 99.37% for DL and 93.0% to 99.0% for ML. DL models achieved specificities from 78.0% to 94.0%, while ML models ranged from 93.0% to 100%. F1-scores for DL were between 93.0% and 97.0%, and for ML between 96.0% and 98.27%. DL models scored ROC between 68.0% and 78.0%, while ML models ranged from 84.0% to 96.08%. Key features for predicting intubation necessity include GCS at admission, ICU admission, age, longer folic acid therapy duration, elevated BUN and AST levels, VBG_HCO3 at initial record, and hemodialysis presence. This study as the showcases XAI's effectiveness in predicting intubation necessity in methanol-poisoned patients. ML models, particularly RF and XGB, outperform DL counterparts, underscoring their potential for clinical decision-making.",

At variance with recent results on quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits, in our current protocol coherent feedback during the learning process is not required, enabling its implementation in a wide variety of quantum systems. We consider diverse possible scenarios for an agent, an environment, and a register that connects them, involving multiqubit and multilevel systems, as well as open-system dynamics. We finally propose possible implementations of this protocol in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.

    "title": "Defining and Predicting Pain Volatility in Users of the Manage My Pain App: Analysis Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Methods.",
    "abstract": "Measuring and predicting pain volatility (fluctuation or variability in pain scores over time) can help improve pain management. Perceptions of pain and its consequent disabling effects are often heightened under the conditions of greater uncertainty and unpredictability associated with pain volatility. This study aimed to use data mining and machine learning methods to (1) define a new measure of pain volatility and (2) predict future pain volatility levels from users of the pain management app, Manage My Pain, based on demographic, clinical, and app use features. Pain volatility was defined as the mean of absolute changes between 2 consecutive self-reported pain severity scores within the observation periods. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to users' pain volatility scores at the first and sixth month of app use to establish a threshold discriminating low from high volatility classes. Subsequently, we extracted 130 demographic, clinical, and app usage features from the first month of app use to predict these 2 volatility classes at the sixth month of app use. Prediction models were developed using 4 methods: (1) logistic regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; (3) Random Forests; and (4) Support Vector Machines. Overall prediction accuracy and accuracy for both classes were calculated to compare the performance of the prediction models. Training and testing were conducted using 5-fold cross validation. A class imbalance issue was addressed using a random subsampling of the training dataset. Users with at least five pain records in both the predictor and outcome periods (N=782 users) are included in the analysis. k-means clustering algorithm was applied to pain volatility scores to establish a threshold of 1.6 to differentiate between low and high volatility classes. After validating the threshold using random subsamples, 2 classes were created: low volatility (n=611) and high volatility (n=171). In this class-imbalanced dataset, all 4 prediction models achieved 78.1% (611/782) to 79.0% (618/782) in overall accuracy. However, all models have a prediction accuracy of less than 18.7% (32/171) for the high volatility class. After addressing the class imbalance issue using random subsampling, results improved across all models for the high volatility class to greater than 59.6% (102/171). The prediction model based on Random Forests performs the best as it consistently achieves approximately 70% accuracy for both classes across 3 random subsamples. We propose a novel method for measuring pain volatility. Cluster analysis was applied to divide users into subsets of low and high volatility classes. These classes were then predicted at the sixth month of app use with an acceptable degree of accuracy using machine learning methods based on the features extracted from demographic, clinical, and app use information from the first month.",

    "title": "Deep network embedding with dimension selection.",
    "abstract": "Network embedding is a general-purpose machine learning technique that converts network data from non-Euclidean space to Euclidean space, facilitating downstream analyses for the networks. However, existing embedding methods are often optimization-based, with the embedding dimension determined in a heuristic or ad hoc way, which can cause potential bias in downstream statistical inference. Additionally, existing deep embedding methods can suffer from a nonidentifiability issue due to the universal approximation power of deep neural networks. We address these issues within a rigorous statistical framework. We treat the embedding vectors as missing data, reconstruct the network features using a sparse decoder, and simultaneously impute the embedding vectors and train the sparse decoder using an adaptive stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Under mild conditions, we show that the sparse decoder provides a parsimonious mapping from the embedding space to network features, enabling effective selection of the embedding dimension and overcoming the nonidentifiability issue encountered by existing deep embedding methods. Furthermore, we show that the embedding vectors converge weakly to a desired posterior distribution in the 2-Wasserstein distance, addressing the potential bias issue experienced by existing embedding methods. This work lays down the first theoretical foundation for network embedding within the framework of missing data imputation.",

    "title": "Tracking medical genetic literature through machine learning.",
    "abstract": "There has been remarkable progress in identifying the causes of genetic conditions as well as understanding how changes in specific genes cause disease. Though difficult (and often superficial) to parse, an interesting tension involves emphasis on basic research aimed to dissect normal and abnormal biology versus more clearly clinical and therapeutic investigations. To examine one facet of this question and to better understand progress in Mendelian-related research, we developed an algorithm that classifies medical literature into three categories (Basic, Clinical, and Management) and conducted a retrospective analysis. We built a supervised machine learning classification model using the Azure Machine Learning (ML) Platform and analyzed the literature (1970-2014) from NCBI's Entrez Gene2Pubmed Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) using genes from the NHGRI's Clinical Genomics Database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/CGD/). We applied our model to 376,738 articles: 288,639 (76.6%) were classified as Basic, 54,178 (14.4%) as Clinical, and 24,569 (6.5%) as Management. The average classification accuracy was 92.2%. The rate of Clinical publication was significantly higher than Basic or Management. The rate of publication of article types differed significantly when divided into key eras: Human Genome Project (HGP) planning phase (1984-1990); HGP launch (1990) to publication (2001); following HGP completion to the \"Next Generation\" advent (2009); the era following 2009. In conclusion, in addition to the findings regarding the pace and focus of genetic progress, our algorithm produced a database that can be used in a variety of contexts including automating the identification of management-related literature.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly prevalent in education, from their use in predicting student dropout to assisting in university admissions and facilitating the rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Given the rapid growth of these novel uses, there is a pressing need to investigate how ML techniques support long-standing education principles and goals. In this work, we shed light on this complex landscape drawing on qualitative insights from interviews with education experts. These interviews comprise in-depth evaluations of ML for education (ML4Ed) papers published in preeminent applied ML conferences over the past decade. Our central research goal is to critically examine how the stated or implied education and societal objectives of these papers are aligned with the ML problems they tackle. That is, to what extent does the technical problem formulation, objectives, approach, and interpretation of results align with the education problem at hand? We find that a cross-disciplinary gap exists and is particularly salient in two parts of the ML life cycle: the formulation of an ML problem from education goals and the translation of predictions to interventions. We use these insights to propose an extended ML life cycle, which may also apply to the use of ML in other domains. Our work joins a growing number of meta-analytical studies across education and ML research as well as critical analyses of the societal impact of ML. Specifically, it fills a gap between the prevailing technical understanding of machine learning and the perspective of education researchers working with students and in policy.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, the persistent trend of human and animal life losses, as well as damage to properties due to wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) remains a significant source of concerns for a broad range of stakeholders. To mitigate their occurrences and impact, many approaches are being adopted, with varying successes. Because of their increased versatility and increasing efficiency, Artificial Intelligence-based methods have been experiencing a significant level of adoption. The present work extensively reviews the literature on intelligent systems incorporating sensor technologies and/or machine learning methods to mitigate WVCs. Included in our review is an investigation of key factors contributing to human-wildlife conflicts, as well as a discussion of dominant state-of-the-art datasets used in the mitigation of WVCs. Our study combines a systematic review with bibliometric analysis. We find that most animal detection systems (excluding autonomous vehicles) are relying neither on state-of-the-art datasets nor on recent breakthrough machine learning approaches. We, therefore, argue that the use of the latest datasets and machine learning techniques will minimize false detection and improve model performance. In addition, the present work covers a comprehensive list of associated challenges ranging from failure to detect hotspot areas to limitations in training datasets. Future research directions identified include the design and development of algorithms for real-time animal detection systems. The latter provides a rationale for the applicability of our proposed solutions, for which we designed a continuous product development lifecycle to determine their feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in attributed networks has become a subject of interest in both academia and industry due to its wide spectrum of applications. Although most existing methods achieve desirable performance by the merit of various graph neural networks, the way they bundle node-affiliated multidimensional attributes into a whole for embedding calculation hinders their ability to model and analyze anomalies at the fine-grained feature level. To characterize anomalies from each feature dimension, we propose Eagle, a deep framework based on bipartitE grAph learninG for anomaLy dEtection. Specifically, we disentangle instances and attributes as two disjoint and independent node sets, then formulate the input attributed network as an intra-connected bipartite graph that involves two different relations: edges across two types of nodes described by attribute values, and links between nodes of the same type recorded in the network topology. By learning a self-supervised edge-level prediction task, named affinity inference, Eagle has good physical sense in explaining abnormal deviations from each attribute. Experiments corroborate the effectiveness of Eagle under transductive and inductive task settings. Moreover, case studies illustrate that Eagle is more user-friendly as it opens the door for humans to understand abnormalities from the perspective of different feature combinations.",

    "abstract": "SymptomGuide Dementia (DGI Clinical Inc) is a publicly available online symptom tracking tool to support caregivers of persons living with dementia. The value of such data are enhanced when the specific dementia stage is identified. We aimed to develop a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify dementia stages based on tracked symptoms. We employed clinical data from 717 people from 3 sources: (1) a memory clinic; (2) long-term care; and (3) an open-label trial of donepezil in vascular and mixed dementia (VASPECT). Symptoms were captured with SymptomGuide Dementia. A clinician classified participants into 4 groups using either the Functional Assessment Staging Test or the Global Deterioration Scale as mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, or severe dementia. Individualized symptom profiles from the pooled data were used to train machine learning models to predict dementia severity. Models trained with 6 different machine learning algorithms were compared using nested cross-validation to identify the best performing model. Model performance was assessed using measures of balanced accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen κ, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The best performing algorithm was used to train a model optimized for balanced accuracy. The study population was mostly female (424/717, 59.1%), older adults (mean 77.3 years, SD 10.6, range 40-100) with mild to moderate dementia (332/717, 46.3%). Age, duration of symptoms, 37 unique dementia symptoms, and 10 symptom-derived variables were used to distinguish dementia stages. A model trained with a support vector machine learning algorithm using a one-versus-rest approach showed the best performance. The correct dementia stage was identified with 83% balanced accuracy (Cohen κ=0.81, AUPRC 0.91, AUROC 0.96). The best performance was seen when classifying severe dementia (AUROC 0.99). A supervised machine learning algorithm exhibited excellent performance in identifying dementia stages based on dementia symptoms reported in an online environment. This novel dementia staging algorithm can be used to describe dementia stage based on user-reported symptoms. This type of symptom recording offers real-world data that reflect important symptoms in people with dementia.",

    "abstract": "The effect of spatial nonuniformity of the temperature distribution was examined on the capability of machine-learning algorithms to provide accurate temperature prediction based on Laser Absorption Spectroscopy. First, sixteen machine learning models were trained as surrogate models of conventional physical methods to measure temperature from uniform temperature distributions (uniform-profile spectra). The best three of them, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), VGG13, and Boosted Random Forest (BRF) were shown to work excellently on uniform profiles but their performance degraded tremendously on nonuniform-profile spectra. This indicated that directly using uniform-profile-targeted methods to nonuniform profiles was improper. However, after retraining models on nonuniform-profile data, the models of GPR and VGG13, which utilized all features of the spectra, not only showed good accuracy and sensitivity to spectral twins, but also showed excellent generalization performance on spectra of increased nonuniformity, which demonstrated that the negative effects of nonuniformity on temperature measurement could be overcome. In contrast, BRF, which utilized partial features, did not have good generalization performance, which implied the nonuniformity level had impact on regional features of spectra. By reducing the data dimensionality through T-SNE and LDA, the visualizations of the data in two-dimensional feature spaces demonstrated that two datasets of substantially different levels of non-uniformity shared very closely similar distributions in terms of both spectral appearance and spectrum-temperature mapping. Notably, datasets from uniform and nonuniform temperature distributions clustered in two different areas of the 2D spaces of the t-SNE and LDA features with very few samples overlapping.",

Machine learning has an established role in identifying features in 'omics' research and is emerging as a tool to generate predictive models to identify people at risk of disease and patients at risk of complications. They have been used to identify risks for malnutrition and obesity. Machine learning techniques have also been used to develop smartphone apps to track behaviour and provide healthcare advice.

Not only classical variants of ML, even those trainable on near-term quantum hardwares have been developed with promising outcomes. Such algorithms have revolutionized materials design and performance of photovoltaics, electronic structure calculations of ground and excited states of correlated matter, computation of force-fields and potential energy surfaces informing chemical reaction dynamics, reactivity inspired rational strategies of drug designing and even classification of phases of matter with accurate identification of emergent criticality.

    "abstract": "We implement 2 different multitask learning (MTL) techniques, hard parameter sharing and cross-stitch, to train a word-level convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically designed for automatic extraction of cancer data from unstructured text in pathology reports. We show the importance of learning related information extraction (IE) tasks leveraging shared representations across the tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Multitask CNN (MTCNN) attempts to tackle document information extraction by learning to extract multiple key cancer characteristics simultaneously. We trained our MTCNN to perform 5 information extraction tasks: (1) primary cancer site (65 classes), (2) laterality (4 classes), (3) behavior (3 classes), (4) histological type (63 classes), and (5) histological grade (5 classes). We evaluated the performance on a corpus of 95 231 pathology documents (71 223 unique tumors) obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry. We compared the performance of the MTCNN models against single-task CNN models and 2 traditional machine learning approaches, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest classifier (RFC). MTCNNs offered superior performance across all 5 tasks in terms of classification accuracy as compared with the other machine learning models. Based on retrospective evaluation, the hard parameter sharing and cross-stitch MTCNN models correctly classified 59.04% and 57.93% of the pathology reports respectively across all 5 tasks. The baseline models achieved 53.68% (CNN), 46.37% (RFC), and 36.75% (SVM). Based on prospective evaluation, the percentages of correctly classified cases across the 5 tasks were 60.11% (hard parameter sharing), 58.13% (cross-stitch), 51.30% (single-task CNN), 42.07% (RFC), and 35.16% (SVM). Moreover, hard parameter sharing MTCNNs outperformed the other models in computational efficiency by using about the same number of trainable parameters as a single-task CNN. The hard parameter sharing MTCNN offers superior classification accuracy for automated coding support of pathology documents across a wide range of cancers and multiple information extraction tasks while maintaining similar training and inference time as those of a single task-specific model.",

    "abstract": "In the living cells, proteins bind small molecules (or \"ligands\") through a \"conformational selection\" mechanism, where a subset of protein structures are capable of binding the small molecules well while most other protein structures are not capable of such binding. The present work uses machine learning approaches to identify, in a very large amount of protein:ligand complexes, what protein properties are associated with their capacity to bind small molecules. In order to do so, we calculate 40 physicochemical properties on about 1.5 millions of protein conformations: ligand and protein conformations. This work describes a machine learning approach to identify the unique physico-chemical descriptors of a protein that maximize the prediction rate of potential protein molecular conformations for the test case proteins ADORA2A (Adenosine A2a Receptor), ADRB2 (Adrenoceptor Beta 2) and OPRK1 (Opioid Receptor Kappa 1). We find adequate machine learning techniques can increase by an order of magnitude the identification of \"binding protein conformations\" in an otherwise very large ensemble of protein conformations, compared to random selection of protein conformations. This opens the door to the systematic identification of such \"binding conformations\" for proteins and provides a big data approach to the conformational selection mechanism.",

Technology can help people at risk of suicide and their families. It could prevent situations of risk of suicide with the technological evolution that is increasing. This work is a systematic review of research papers published in the last ten years on technology for suicide prevention. In September 2017, the consultation was carried out in the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. A general search was conducted with the terms \"prevention\" AND \"suicide\" AND \"technology. More specific searches included technologies such as \"Web\", \"mobile\", \"social networks\", and others terms related to technologies. The number of articles found following the methodology proposed was 90, but only 30 are focused on the objective of this work. Most of them were Web technologies (51.61%), mobile solutions (22.58%), social networks (12.90%), machine learning (3.23%) and other technologies (9.68%). According to the results obtained, although there are technological solutions that help the prevention of suicide, much remains to be done in this field. Collaboration among technologists, psychiatrists, patients, and family members is key to advancing the development of new technology-based solutions that can help save lives.",

    "title": "Multimodal deep learning for biomedical data fusion: a review.",
    "abstract": "Biomedical data are becoming increasingly multimodal and thereby capture the underlying complex relationships among biological processes. Deep learning (DL)-based data fusion strategies are a popular approach for modeling these nonlinear relationships. Therefore, we review the current state-of-the-art of such methods and propose a detailed taxonomy that facilitates more informed choices of fusion strategies for biomedical applications, as well as research on novel methods. By doing so, we find that deep fusion strategies often outperform unimodal and shallow approaches. Additionally, the proposed subcategories of fusion strategies show different advantages and drawbacks. The review of current methods has shown that, especially for intermediate fusion strategies, joint representation learning is the preferred approach as it effectively models the complex interactions of different levels of biological organization. Finally, we note that gradual fusion, based on prior biological knowledge or on search strategies, is a promising future research path. Similarly, utilizing transfer learning might overcome sample size limitations of multimodal data sets. As these data sets become increasingly available, multimodal DL approaches present the opportunity to train holistic models that can learn the complex regulatory dynamics behind health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Model selection and performance assessment for prediction models are important tasks in machine learning, e.g. for the development of medical diagnosis or prognosis rules based on complex data. A common approach is to select the best model via cross-validation and to evaluate this final model on an independent dataset. In this work, we propose to instead evaluate several models simultaneously. These may result from varied hyperparameters or completely different learning algorithms. Our main goal is to increase the probability to correctly identify a model that performs sufficiently well. In this case, adjusting for multiplicity is necessary in the evaluation stage to avoid an inflation of the family wise error rate. We apply the so-called maxT-approach which is based on the joint distribution of test statistics and suitable to (approximately) control the family-wise error rate for a wide variety of performance measures. We conclude that evaluating only a single final model is suboptimal. Instead, several promising models should be evaluated simultaneously, e.g. all models within one standard error of the best validation model. This strategy has proven to increase the probability to correctly identify a good model as well as the final model performance in extensive simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating with machine learning technology, neuroimaging markers which extracted from structural Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI), can help distinguish Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients from Healthy Controls (HC). In the present study, we aim to investigate differences in atrophic regions between HC and AD and apply machine learning methods to classify these two groups. T1-weighted sMRI scans of 158 patients with AD and 145 age-matched HC were acquired from the ADNI database. Five kinds of parameters (i.e. cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter volume, curvature and sulcal depth) were obtained through the preprocessing steps. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for support vector machine (SVM) and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) were applied to determine the optimal feature dimensions. Each kind of parameter was trained by SVM algorithm to acquire a classifier, which was used to classify HC and AD ultimately. Moreover, the ROC curves were depicted for testing the classifiers' performance and the SVM classifiers of two-dimensional spaces took the top two important features as classification features for separating HC and AD to the maximum extent. The results showed that the decreased cortical thickness and gray matter volume dramatically exhibited the trend of atrophy. The key differences between AD and HC existed in the cortical thickness and gray matter volume of the entorhinal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. In terms of classification results, an optimal accuracy of 90.76% was obtained via multi-parameter combination (i.e. cortical thickness, gray matter volume and surface area). Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were also verified multi-parameter combination could reach a better classification performance (AUC=0.94) after the SVM-RFE method. The results could be well prove that multi-parameter combination could provide more useful classified features from multivariate anatomical structure than single parameter. In addition, as cortical thickness and multi-parameter combination contained more important classified information with fewer feature dimensions after feature selection, it could be optimum to separate HC from AD to take the top two important features of them to construct SVM classifiers in two-dimensional space. The proposed work is a promising approach suggesting an important role for machine-learning based diagnostic image analysis for clinical practice.",

    "title": "Early detection of sepsis utilizing deep learning on electronic health record event sequences.",
    "abstract": "The timeliness of detection of a sepsis incidence in progress is a crucial factor in the outcome for the patient. Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model. In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time. Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24 h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time. We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset.",

    "abstract": "Starting from the concept of the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), continuing with the virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) and most recently with the Open RAN (O-RAN) initiative, Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures have significantly evolved in the past decade. In the last few years, the wireless industry has witnessed a strong trend towards disaggregated, virtualized and open RANs, with numerous tests and deployments worldwide. One unique aspect that motivates this paper is the availability of new opportunities that arise from using machine learning, more specifically multi-agent team learning (MATL), to optimize the RAN in a closed-loop where the complexity of disaggregation and virtualization makes well-known Self-Organized Networking (SON) solutions inadequate. In our view, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) with MATL can play an essential role in the orchestration of O-RAN controllers, i.e., near-real-time and non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controllers (RIC). In this article, we first provide an overview of the landscape in RAN disaggregation, virtualization and O-RAN, then we present the state-of-the-art research in multi-agent systems and team learning as well as their application to O-RAN. We present a case study for team learning where agents are two distinct xApps: power allocation and radio resource allocation. We demonstrate how team learning can enhance network performance when team learning is used instead of individual learning agents. Finally, we identify challenges and open issues to provide a roadmap for researchers in the area of MATL based O-RAN optimization.",

These processes are often performed manually by medical biologists using different shapes and morphological characteristics of bacteria species. However, it is clear that the manual taxonomy of bacteria types from microscopy images takes time and effort and is a great challenge for even experienced experts. A new revolution has been inaugurating with the development of machine learning methods to identify bacteria automatically from digital electron microscopy. In this paper, we introduce an automated model of bacteria shape classification based on Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Networks (DS-CNNs). This architecture has excellent advantages with lower computational costs and reliable recognition accuracy. The experiment results indicate that after training with 1669 images, the proposed architecture can reach 97% validation accuracy and work well to classify three main shapes of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Classifying images has become a straightforward and accessible task, thanks to the advent of Deep Neural Networks. Nevertheless, not much attention is given to the privacy concerns associated with sensitive data contained in images. In this study, we propose a solution to this issue by exploring an intersection between Machine Learning and cryptography. In particular, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) emerges as a promising solution, as it enables computations to be performed on encrypted data. We therefore propose a Residual Network implementation based on FHE which allows the classification of encrypted images, ensuring that only the user can see the result. We suggest a circuit which reduces the memory requirements by more than [Formula: see text] compared to the most recent works, while maintaining a high level of accuracy and a short computational time. We implement the circuit using the well-known Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, which enables approximate encrypted computations. We evaluate the results from three perspectives: memory requirements, computational time and calculations precision. We demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate an encrypted ResNet20 in less than five minutes on a laptop using approximately 15[Formula: see text]GB of memory, achieving an accuracy of 91.67% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is almost equivalent to the accuracy of the plain model (92.60%).",

Herein, we proposed a new approach to avoid the descriptor generation: to regard ToF-SIMS spectra as images and apply the convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze these spectral images. We applied and assessed this approach for the identification of silane coupling agents in multicomponent films. Furthermore, the CNN showed higher accuracy than descriptor-based approaches, suggesting its usefulness in achieving the automation and standardization of the ToF-SIMS analysis.",

Nevertheless, microarrays remain in widespread use, demonstrated by the ever-growing numbers of samples deposited in public repositories. We propose a novel approach to microarray analysis that attains many of the advantages of RNA-Seq. This method, called Machine Learning of Transcript Expression (MaLTE), leverages samples for which both microarray and RNA-Seq data are available, using a Random Forest to learn the relationship between the fluorescence intensity of sets of microarray probes and RNA-Seq transcript expression estimates. We trained MaLTE on data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, consisting of Affymetrix gene arrays and RNA-Seq from over 700 samples across a broad range of human tissues. This approach can be used to accurately estimate absolute expression levels from microarray data, at both gene and transcript level, which has not previously been possible.

    "abstract": "Many real-world applications suffer from the class imbalance problem, in which some classes have significantly fewer examples compared to the other classes. In this paper, we focus on online sequential learning methods, which are considerably more preferable to tackle the large size imbalanced classification problems effectively. For example, weighted online sequential extreme learning machine (WOS-ELM), voting based weighted online sequential extreme learning machine (VWOS-ELM) and weighted online sequential extreme learning machine with kernels (WOS-ELMK), etc. handle the imbalanced learning effectively. One of our recent works class-specific extreme learning machine (CS-ELM) uses class-specific regularization and has been shown to perform better for imbalanced learning. This work proposes a novel online sequential class-specific extreme learning machine (OSCSELM), which is a variant of CS-ELM. OSCSELM supports online learning technique in both chunk-by-chunk and one-by-one learning mode. It targets to handle the class imbalance problem for both small and larger datasets. The proposed work has less computational complexity in contrast with WOS-ELM for imbalanced learning. The proposed method is assessed by utilizing benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as it outperforms the other methods for imbalanced learning.",

    "abstract": "We describe here a protocol for the label-free identification of lymphocyte subtypes using quantitative phase imaging and machine learning. Identification of lymphocyte subtypes is important for the study of immunology as well as diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Currently, standard methods for classifying lymphocyte types rely on labeling specific membrane proteins via antigen-antibody reactions. However, these labeling techniques carry the potential risks of altering cellular functions. The protocol described here overcomes these challenges by exploiting intrinsic optical contrasts measured by 3D quantitative phase imaging and a machine learning algorithm. Measurement of 3D refractive index (RI) tomograms of lymphocytes provides quantitative information about 3D morphology and phenotypes of individual cells. The biophysical parameters extracted from the measured 3D RI tomograms are then quantitatively analyzed with a machine learning algorithm, enabling label-free identification of lymphocyte types at a single-cell level. We measure the 3D RI tomograms of B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T lymphocytes and identified their cell types with over 80% accuracy. In this protocol, we describe the detailed steps for lymphocyte isolation, 3D quantitative phase imaging, and machine learning for identifying lymphocyte types.",

Though by no means comprehensive, the chapter highlights several prominent computational tools applied in the field and their potential use cases. The examples detailed reinforce how ML algorithms can enhance synthetic biology research by providing data-driven insights into the behavior of living systems, even without detailed knowledge of their underlying mechanisms. By doing so, ML promises to increase the efficiency of research projects by modeling hypotheses in silico that can then be tested through experiments. While challenges related to training dataset generation and computational costs remain, ongoing improvements in ML tools are paving the way for smarter and more streamlined synthetic biology workflows that can be readily employed to address grand challenges across manufacturing, medicine, engineering, agriculture, and beyond.",

However, and despite numerous revisions to the MELD score, current liver allocation still does not allow for equitable access to all waitlisted liver candidates. An optimized prediction of mortality (OPOM) was developed utilizing novel machine-learning optimal classification tree models trained to predict a liver candidate's 3-month waitlist mortality or removal. When compared to MELD and MELD-Na, OPOM more accurately and objectively prioritized candidates for liver transplantation based on disease severity. In simulation analysis, OPOM allowed for more equitable allocation of livers with a resultant significant number of additional lives saved every year when compared with MELD-based allocation. Machine learning technology holds the potential to help guide transplant clinical practice, and thus potentially guide national organ allocation policy.",

With the limitation and insufficiency of the static evaluation method, we study and construct an evaluation method of dynamic reliability for the anticorrosive layer, integrating the trend analysis of the Markov chain and the set pair theory. This method is implemented by the machine learning software of PyCharm community edition, based on language. The algorithm utilizes the connection degree in the set pair theory to determine the risk levels of the anticorrosive coating systems. According to the characteristics of the dynamic change of the anticorrosive layer with time, we built the mathematical evaluation model by combining it with the nonaftereffect property of the Markov chain. Therefore, we can make a dynamic and useful analysis for the reliability grade of the anticorrosive coating and assess the effectiveness grade of the changed reliability for the anticorrosive coating after some time. This method can effectively evaluate the reliability level of the anticorrosion coating through the example of big data of detection points. Under national standards, we provide the theoretical basis for pipeline maintenance within detection cycle requirements.",

In this manuscript, we employ machine learning and symbolic regression method coupled with DFT calculations to investigate the adsorption of atmospheric organic molecules on a low-dimensional metal oxide mineral system. The starting dataset consisting of the atomic structures of the organic/metal oxide interfaces are obtained via the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and different machine learning algorithms are compared, with the random forest algorithm achieving high accuracies for the target output. The feature ranking step identifies that the polarizability and bond type of the organic adsorbates are the key descriptors for the adsorption energy output. In addition, the symbolic regression coupled with genetic programming automatically identifies a series of hybrid new descriptors displaying improved relevance with the target output, suggesting the viability of symbolic regression to complement the traditional machine learning techniques for the descriptor design and fast modeling purposes. This manuscript provides a framework for effectively modeling and analyzing the adsorption of the organic molecules on low-dimensional surfaces via comprehensive data-driven approaches.",

Traditionally researchers have accounted for spatial autocorrelation in occupancy data by using a correlated normally distributed site-level random effect, which might be incapable of modeling nontraditional spatial dependence such as discontinuities and abrupt transitions. Machine learning approaches have the potential to model nontraditional spatial dependence, but these approaches do not account for observer errors such as false absences. By combining the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchal modeling and machine learning approaches, we present a general framework to model occupancy data that accounts for both traditional and nontraditional spatial dependence as well as false absences. We demonstrate our framework using six synthetic occupancy data sets and two real data sets. Our results demonstrate how to model both traditional and nontraditional spatial dependence in occupancy data, which enables a broader class of spatial occupancy models that can be used to improve predictive accuracy and model adequacy.",

This approach does not only quickly converge to an optimal parameter set, but in addition provides information about the complete parameter space, which allows for example to identify extended parameter regions where numerical spectra are consistent with the experimental one. We consider as example dimers of organic molecules and aim at extracting in particular the interaction between the monomers, and their mutual orientation.

One of the critics on machine learning is that it doesn't outperform more traditional statistical approaches in every problem. Authors of \"Predictive Abilities of Machine Learning Techniques May Be Limited by Dataset Characteristics: Insights From the UNOS Database\" presented in the current issue of the Journal of Cardiac Failure that machine learning approaches do not provide significantly higher performance when compared to more traditional statistical approaches in predicting mortality following heart transplant. In this brief report, we provide an insight on the possible reasons for why machine learning methods do not outperform more traditional approaches for every problem and every dataset. Most of the performance-focused critics on machine learning are because the bar is set unfairly too high for machine learning. In most cases, machine learning methods provides at least as good results as traditional statistical methods do. It is normal for machine learning models to provide similar performance with linear models if the actual underlying input-outcome relationship is linear. Moreover, machine learning methods outperforms linear statistical models when the underlying input-output relationship is not linear and if the dataset is large enough and include predictors capturing that nonlinear relationship.",

These representations have been widely premised to be also suited for graph visualization. However, no benchmarks or encompassing studies on this topic exist. We present an empirical study comparing several state-of-the-art representation learning methods with two recent graph layout algorithms, using readability and distance-based measures as well as the link prediction performance. Generally, no method consistently outperformed the others across quality measures. The graph layout methods provided qualitatively superior layouts when compared to representation learning methods.

Ten experienced hockey players performed 80 shots using four sticks of differing constructions (i.e., each stick differed in stiffness, blade pattern, or kick point). Custom IMUs were embedded in a pair of hockey gloves to capture resultant linear acceleration and angular velocity of the hands during shooting while an 18-camera optical motion capture system and retroreflective markers were used to identify key shot events and measure puck speed, accuracy, and contact time with the stick blade. MATLAB R2020a's Machine Learning Toolbox was used to build and evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms using principal components of the resultant hand kinematic signals using principal components accounting for 95% of the variability and a five-fold cross validation. Fine k-nearest neighbors algorithms were found to be highly accurate, correctly classifying players by optimal stick flex, blade pattern, and kick point with 90-98% accuracy for slap shots and 93-97% accuracy for wrist shots in fractions of a second. Based on these findings, it appears promising that wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms can be used for reliable, rapid, and portable hockey stick fitting.",

    "abstract": "Hypergraph learning is a new research hotspot in the machine learning field. The performance of the hypergraph learning model depends on the quality of the hypergraph structure built by different feature extraction methods as well as its incidence matrix. However, the existing models are all hypergraph structures built based on one feature extraction method, with limited feature extraction and abstract expression ability. This paper proposed a multimodal feature fusion method, which firstly built a single modal hypergraph structure based on different feature extraction methods, and then extended the hypergraph incidence matrix and weight matrix of different modals. The extended matrices fuse the multimodal abstract feature and an expanded Markov random walk range during model learning, with stronger feature expression ability. However, the extended multimodal incidence matrix has a high scale and high computational cost. Therefore, the Laplacian matrix fusion method was proposed, which performed Laplacian matrix transformation on the incidence matrix and weight matrix of every model, respectively, and then conducted a weighted superposition on these Laplacian matrices for subsequent model training. The tests on four different types of datasets indicate that the hypergraph learning model obtained after multimodal feature fusion has a better classification performance than the single modal model. After Laplace matrix fusion, the average time can be reduced by about 40% compared with the extended incidence matrix, the classification performance can be further improved, and the index F1 can be improved by 8.4%.",

    "abstract": "Rockburst forecasting plays a crucial role in prevention and control of rockburst disaster. To improve the accuracy of rockburst prediction at the data structure and algorithm levels, the Yeo-Johnson transform, K-means SMOTE oversampling, and optimal rockburst feature dimension determination are used to optimize the data structure. At the algorithm optimization level, ensemble stacking rockburst prediction is performed based on the data structure optimization. First, to solve the problem of many outliers and data imbalance in the distribution of rockburst data, the Yeo-Johnson transform and k-means SMOTE algorithm are respectively used to solve the problems. Then, based on six original rockburst features, 21 new features are generated using the PolynomialFeatures function in Sklearn. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction is applied to eliminate the correlations between the 27 features. Thirteen types of machine learning algorithms are used to predict datasets that retain different numbers of features after dimensionality reduction to determine the optimal rockburst feature dimension. Finally, the 14-feature rockburst dataset is used as the input for integrated stacking. The results show that the ensemble stacking model based on Yeo-Johnson, K-means SMOTE, and optimal rockburst feature dimension determination can improve the accuracy of rockburst prediction by 0.1602-0.3636. Compared with the 13 single machine learning models without data preprocessing, this data structure optimization and algorithm optimization method effectively improves the accuracy of rockburst prediction.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing and artificial intelligence are pivotal technologies of precision agriculture nowadays. The efficient retrieval of large-scale field imagery combined with machine learning techniques shows success in various tasks like phenotyping, weeding, cropping, and disease control. This work will introduce a machine learning framework for automatized large-scale plant-specific trait annotation for the use case of disease severity scoring for CLS in sugar beet. With concepts of DLDL, special loss functions, and a tailored model architecture, we develop an efficient Vision Transformer based model for disease severity scoring called SugarViT. One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks. With our framework, it is even possible to learn models on multi-objective problems, as we show by a pretraining on environmental metadata. Furthermore, we perform several comparison experiments with state-of-the-art methods and models to constitute our modeling and preprocessing choices.",

    "abstract": "We present machine learning models for predicting the chemical context for Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reactions, i. e., what chemicals to add to the reactants to give a productive reaction. Using reaction data from in-house electronic lab notebooks, we train two models: one based on single-label data and one based on multi-label data. Both models show excellent top-3 accuracy of approximately 90 %, which suggests strong predictivity. Furthermore, there seems to be an advantage of including multi-label data because the multi-label model shows higher accuracy and better sensitivity for the individual contexts than the single-label model. Although the models are performant, we also show that such models need to be re-trained periodically as there is a strong temporal characteristic to the usage of different contexts. Therefore, a model trained on historical data will decrease in usefulness with time as newer and better contexts emerge and replace older ones. We hypothesize that such significant transitions in the context-usage will likely affect any model predicting chemical contexts trained on historical data. Consequently, training context prediction models warrants careful planning of what data is used for training and how often the model needs to be re-trained.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) constitute a rapidly growing class of natural products with diverse structures and bioactivities. We have developed RiPPMiner, a novel bioinformatics resource for deciphering chemical structures of RiPPs by genome mining. RiPPMiner derives its predictive power from machine learning based classifiers, trained using a well curated database of more than 500 experimentally characterized RiPPs. RiPPMiner uses Support Vector Machine to distinguish RiPP precursors from other small proteins and classify the precursors into 12 sub-classes of RiPPs. For classes like lanthipeptide, cyanobactin, lasso peptide and thiopeptide, RiPPMiner can predict leader cleavage site and complex cross-links between post-translationally modified residues starting from genome sequences. RiPPMiner can identify correct cross-link pattern in a core peptide from among a very large number of combinatorial possibilities. Benchmarking of prediction accuracy of RiPPMiner on a large lanthipeptide dataset indicated high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. RiPPMiner also provides interfaces for visualization of the chemical structure, downloading of simplified molecular-input line-entry system and searching for RiPPs having similar sequences or chemical structures. The backend database of RiPPMiner provides information about modification system, precursor sequence, leader and core sequence, modified residues, cross-links and gene cluster for more than 500 experimentally characterized RiPPs.

    "title": "From leaf to harvest: achieving sustainable agriculture through advanced disease prediction with DBN-EKELM.",
    "abstract": "In the agricultural sector, the early identification of plant diseases presents a pressing challenge. Throughout the growing season, plants remain vulnerable to an array of diseases. Failure to detect these diseases at their early stages can significantly compromise the overall yield, thereby reducing profitability for farmers. To address this issue, several researchers have introduced standard methods that leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, many of these methods offer limited classification accuracy and often necessitate extensive training parameter adjustments. The objective of this study is to develop a new deep learning-based technique for detecting and classifying plant diseases at earlier stages. Thus, this paper introduces a novel technique known as the deep belief network-based enhanced kernel extreme learning machine (DBN-EKELM) that identifies a disease automatically and performs effective classification. The initial phase involves data preprocessing to enhance quality of plant leaf images, facilitating the extraction of critical information. With the goal of achieving superior classification accuracy, this paper proposes the use of the DBN-EKELM technique for optimal plant leaf disease detection. Given that KELM parameters are highly sensitive to minor variations, proper parameter tuning is essential and introduces a novel binary gaining sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (NBGSK). The efficacy of the proposed DBN-EKELM method is evaluated by comparing its performance with other conventional methods, considering various measures like accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and F-measure. Experimental analyses demonstrate that the DBN-EKELM technique achieves an impressive rate of approximately 98.2%, 97%, 98.1%, 97.4% as well as 97.8%, surpassing other standard methods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "title": "Machine learning approach for the detection of vitamin D level: a comparative study.",
    "abstract": "After the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of Vitamin D has become even more critical for people worldwide. The most accurate way to define vitamin D level is 25-hydroxy vitamin D(25-OH-D) blood test. However, this blood test is not always feasible. Most data sets used in health science research usually contain highly correlated features, which is referred to as multicollinearity problem. This problem can lead to misleading results and overfitting problems in the ML training process. Therefore, the proposed study aims to determine a clinically acceptable ML model for the detection of the vitamin D status of the North Cyprus adult participants accurately, without the need to determine 25-OH-D level, taking into account the multicollinearity problem. The study was conducted with 481 observations who applied voluntarily to Internal Medicine Department at NEU Hospital. The classification performance of four conventional supervised ML models, namely, Ordinal logistic regression(OLR), Elastic-net ordinal regression(ENOR), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Random Forest (RF) was compared. The comparative analysis is performed regarding the model's sensitivity to the participant's metabolic syndrome(MtS)'positive status, hyper-parameter tuning, sensitivities to the size of training data, and the classification performance of the models. Due to the presence of multicollinearity, the findings showed that the performance of the SVM(RBF) is obviously negatively affected when the test is examined. Moreover, it can be obviously detected that RF is more robust than other models when the variations in the size of training data are examined. This experiment's result showed that the selected RF and ENOR showed better performances than the other two models when the size of training samples was reduced. Since the multicollinearity is more severe in the small samples, it can be concluded that RF and ENOR are not affected by the presence of the multicollinearity problem. The comparative analysis revealed that the RF classifier performed better and was more robust than the other proposed models in terms of accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.96), sensitivity or recall (0.94), precision (0.95), F1-score (0.95), and Cohen's kappa (0.90). It is evident that the RF achieved better than the SVM(RBF), ENOR, and OLR. These comparison findings will be applied to develop a Vitamin D level intelligent detection system for being used in routine clinical, biochemical tests, and lifestyle characteristics of individuals to decrease the cost and time of vitamin D level detection.",

    "abstract": "A crucial part of biomedical research is drug discovery, which aims to find and create innovative medical treatments for a range of illnesses. However, there are intrinsic obstacles to the traditional approach of discovering novel medications, including high prices, lengthy turnaround times, and poor clinical trial success rates. In recent times, the use of designing algorithms for machine learning has become a groundbreaking way to improve and optimise many stages of medication development. An outline of the quickly developing area of machine learning algorithms for drug discovery is given in this review, emphasising how revolutionary treatment development might be. To effectively get a novel medication into the market, modern medicinal development often involves many interconnected stages. The use of computational tools has become more and more crucial in reducing the time and cost involved in the investigation and creation of new medications. Our latest efforts to combine molecular modelling as well as machine learning to create the computational resources for designing modulators utilising a sensible design influenced by the pocket process that targets protein-protein interactions via AlphaSpace are reviewed in this Perspective. A significant shift in pharmaceutical research has occurred with the introduction of AI in drug discovery, which combines cutting-edge computer techniques with conventional scientific investigation to address enduring problems.

    "title": "Explaining protein-protein interactions with knowledge graph-based semantic similarity.",
    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods for several biomedical applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction, has gained significant traction in recent decades. However, explainability is a key aspect of using machine learning as a tool for scientific discovery. Explainable artificial intelligence approaches help clarify algorithmic mechanisms and identify potential bias in the data. Given the complexity of the biomedical domain, explanations should be grounded in domain knowledge which can be achieved by using ontologies and knowledge graphs. These knowledge graphs express knowledge about a domain by capturing different perspectives of the representation of real-world entities. However, the most popular way to explore knowledge graphs with machine learning is through using embeddings, which are not explainable. As an alternative, knowledge graph-based semantic similarity offers the advantage of being explainable. Additionally, similarity can be computed to capture different semantic aspects within the knowledge graph and increasing the explainability of predictive approaches. We propose a novel method to generate explainable vector representations, KGsim2vec, that uses aspect-oriented semantic similarity features to represent pairs of entities in a knowledge graph. Our approach employs a set of machine learning models, including decision trees, genetic programming, random forest and eXtreme gradient boosting, to predict relations between entities. The experiments reveal that considering multiple semantic aspects when representing the similarity between two entities improves explainability and predictive performance. KGsim2vec performs better than black-box methods based on knowledge graph embeddings or graph neural networks. Moreover, KGsim2vec produces global models that can capture biological phenomena and elucidate data biases.",

    "title": "Healthcare Text Classification System and its Performance Evaluation: A Source of Better Intelligence by Characterizing Healthcare Text.",
    "abstract": "A machine learning (ML)-based text classification system has several classifiers. The performance evaluation (PE) of the ML system is typically driven by the training data size and the partition protocols used. Such systems lead to low accuracy because the text classification systems lack the ability to model the input text data in terms of noise characteristics. This research study proposes a concept of misrepresentation ratio (MRR) on input healthcare text data and models the PE criteria for validating the hypothesis. Further, such a novel system provides a platform to amalgamate several attributes of the ML system such as: data size, classifier type, partitioning protocol and percentage MRR. Our comprehensive data analysis consisted of five types of text data sets (TwitterA, WebKB4, Disease, Reuters (R8), and SMS); five kinds of classifiers (support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-L), MLP-based neural network, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient descent and decision tree); and five types of training protocols (K2, K4, K5, K10 and JK). Using the decreasing order of MRR, our ML system demonstrates the mean classification accuracies as: 70.13 ± 0.15%, 87.34 ± 0.06%, 93.73 ± 0.03%, 94.45 ± 0.03% and 97.83 ± 0.01%, respectively, using all the classifiers and protocols. The corresponding AUC is 0.98 for SMS data using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based neural network. All the classifiers, the best accuracy of 91.84 ± 0.04% is shown to be of MLP-based neural network and this is 6% better over previously published. Further we observed that as MRR decreases, the system robustness increases and validated by standard deviations. The overall text system accuracy using all data types, classifiers, protocols is 89%, thereby showing the entire ML system to be novel, robust and unique. The system is also tested for stability and reliability.",

Recent advancements in machine learning even further expedite the quest to improve accuracy in fault detection for economic purposes by minimizing scheduled maintenance. Challenging tasks, such as the gathering of high quality data to explicitly train an algorithm, still persist and are limited in terms of the availability of historical data. In addition, failure data from measurements are typically valid only for the particular machinery components and their settings. In this study, 3D multi-body simulations of a roller bearing with different faults have been conducted to create a variety of synthetic training data for a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) and, hence, to address these challenges. The vibration data from the simulation are superimposed with noise collected from the measurement of a healthy bearing and are subsequently converted into a 2D image via wavelet transformation before being fed into the CNN for training. Measurements of damaged bearings are used to validate the algorithm's performance.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is an advanced field of radiation oncology. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) methods can support daily setup and assess anatomical variations during therapy, which could prevent incorrect dose distribution and unexpected toxicities. A re-planning to correct these anatomical variations should be done daily/weekly, but to be applicable to a large number of patients, still require time consumption and resources. Using unsupervised machine learning on retrospective data, we have developed a predictive network, to identify patients that would benefit of a re-planning. 1200 MVCT of 40 head and neck (H&N) cases were re-contoured, automatically, using deformable hybrid registration and structures mapping. Deformable algorithm and MATLAB(®) homemade machine learning process, developed, allow prediction of criticalities for Tomotherapy treatments. Using retrospective analysis of H&N treatments, we have investigated and predicted tumor shrinkage and organ at risk (OAR) deformations. Support vector machine (SVM) and cluster analysis have identified cases or treatment sessions with potential criticalities, based on dose and volume discrepancies between fractions. During 1st weeks of treatment, 84% of patients shown an output comparable to average standard radiation treatment behavior. Starting from the 4th week, significant morpho-dosimetric changes affect 77% of patients, suggesting need for re-planning. The comparison of treatment delivered and ART simulation was carried out with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showing monotonous increase of ROC area. Warping methods, supported by daily image analysis and predictive tools, can improve personalization and monitoring of each treatment, thereby minimizing anatomic and dosimetric divergences from initial constraints.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to enhance multispecialty CT and MRI protocol assignment quality and efficiency through development, testing, and proposed workflow design of a natural language processing (NLP)-based machine learning classifier. NLP-based machine learning classification models were developed using order entry input data and radiologist-assigned protocols from more than 18,000 unique CT and MRI examinations obtained during routine clinical use. k-Nearest neighbor, random forest, and deep neural network classification models were evaluated at baseline and after applying class frequency and confidence thresholding techniques. To simulate performance in real-world deployment, the model was evaluated in two operating modes in combination: automation (automated assignment of the top result) and clinical decision support (CDS; top-three protocol suggestion for clinical review). Finally, model-radiologist discordance was subjectively reviewed to guide explainability and safe use. Baseline protocol assignment performance achieved weighted precision of 0.757 to 0.824. Simulating real-world deployment using combined thresholding techniques, the optimized deep neural network model assigned 69% of protocols in automation mode with 95% accuracy. In the remaining 31% of cases, the model achieved 92% accuracy in CDS mode. Analysis of discordance with subspecialty radiologist labels revealed both more and less appropriate model predictions. A multiclass NLP-based classification algorithm was designed to drive local operational improvement in CT and MR radiology protocol assignment at subspecialist quality. The results demonstrate a simulated workflow deployment enabling automated assignment of protocols in nearly 7 of 10 cases with very few errors combined with top-three CDS for remaining cases supporting a high-quality, efficient radiology workflow.",

    "abstract": "The satellite-based tropospheric column ratio of HCHO to NO (FNR) is widely used to diagnose ozone formation sensitivity; however, its representation of surface conditions remains controversial. In this study, an approach to construct the 3D spatial distribution of the FNR in the lower troposphere was proposed. Based on satellite and multiaxes-differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) data, the horizontal and vertical distributions of the FNR have been respectively obtained. To further enhance the generalizability of this approach, we also reproduced the vertical profiles of the FNR using a machine learning model (Bagged trees) and feature variables. Here, using the three-dimensional distribution of the FNR during the summer of 2019 as an example, a fourth-order polynomial relationship was found between the reconstruction factors ( ) and altitudes, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of 0.98. Utilizing this established relationship, a significant difference was found between the reconstructed surface FNR and the satellite column FNR, with the former decreasing by 56.9%. Moreover, the reconstructed 3D spatial distribution of the FNR for the summers from 2018 to 2022 revealed a trend over the five years in Shanghai of the ozone formation control regimes gradually shifting toward the transition and NO -limited regimes. Through this newly established approach, not only can the accuracy of identifying surface ozone sensitivity be enhanced from the spaced observation, but also it helps in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the ozone photochemical formation mechanisms in the vertical direction.",

However, these techniques rely on a large amount of label data to form accurate predictions of molecular properties. At each stage of the drug discovery pipeline, usually, only a few biological data of candidate molecules and derivatives are available, indicating that the application of deep neural networks for low-data drug discovery is still a formidable challenge. Here, we propose a meta learning architecture with graph attention network, Meta-GAT, to predict molecular properties in low-data drug discovery. The GAT captures the local effects of atomic groups at the atom level through the triple attentional mechanism and implicitly captures the interactions between different atomic groups at the molecular level. GAT is used to perceive molecular chemical environment and connectivity, thereby effectively reducing sample complexity. Meta-GAT further develops a meta learning strategy based on bilevel optimization, which transfers meta knowledge from other attribute prediction tasks to low-data target tasks. In summary, our work demonstrates how meta learning can reduce the amount of data required to make meaningful predictions of molecules in low-data scenarios. Meta learning is likely to become the new learning paradigm in low-data drug discovery. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lol88/Meta-GAT.",

    "title": "Generative machine learning for de novo drug discovery: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Recent research on artificial intelligence indicates that machine learning algorithms can auto-generate novel drug-like molecules. Generative models have revolutionized de novo drug discovery, rendering the explorative process more efficient. Several model frameworks and input formats have been proposed to enhance the performance of intelligent algorithms in generative molecular design. In this systematic literature review of experimental articles and reviews over the last five years, machine learning models, challenges associated with computational molecule design along with proposed solutions, and molecular encoding methods are discussed. A query-based search of the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, Wiley Online Library, arXiv, MDPI, bioRxiv, and IEEE Xplore databases yielded 87 studies. Twelve additional studies were identified via citation searching. Of the articles in which machine learning was implemented, six prominent algorithms were identified: long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), adversarial autoencoders (AAEs), evolutionary algorithms, and gated recurrent unit (GRU-RNNs). Furthermore, eight central challenges were designated: homogeneity of generated molecular libraries, deficient synthesizability, limited assay data, model interpretability, incapacity for multi-property optimization, incomparability, restricted molecule size, and uncertainty in model evaluation. Molecules were encoded either as strings, which were occasionally augmented using randomization, as 2D graphs, or as 3D graphs. Statistical analysis and visualization are performed to illustrate how approaches to machine learning in de novo drug design have evolved over the past five years. Finally, future opportunities and reservations are discussed.",

    "title": "Enhancing lead adsorption capacity prediction in biochar: a comparative study of machine learning models and parameter optimization.",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models for predicting lead adsorption in biochar, based on preparation features, are currently lacking in the environmental field. Existing conventional models suffer from accuracy limitations. This study addresses these challenges by developing back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) models using selected features: preparation temperature (T), specific surface area (BET), relative carbon content (C), molar ratios of hydrogen to carbon (H/C), oxygen to carbon (O/C), nitrogen to carbon (N/C), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The RF model outperforms BPNN, improving R by 10%. Additional features and particle swarm optimization enhance the RF model's accuracy, resulting in an 8.3% improvement in R , a decrease in RMSE by up to 56.1%, and a 55.7% reduction in MAE. The importance ranking of features places CEC > C > BET > O/C > H/C > N/C > T, highlighting the significance of CEC in lead adsorption. Strengthening the complexation effect may improve lead removal in biochar. This study contributes valuable insights for predicting and optimizing lead adsorption in biochar, addressing the accuracy gap in existing models. It lays the foundation for future investigations and the development of effective biochar-based solutions for sustainable lead removal in water remediation.",

    "abstract": "Plant stress diagnosis is essential for efficient crop management and productivity increase. Under stress, plants undergo physiological and compositional changes. Vegetation indices obtained from leaf reflectance spectra and bioimpedance spectroscopy provide information about the external and internal aspects of plant responses, respectively. In this study, bioimpedance and vegetation indices were noninvasively acquired from sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) leaves exposed to three types of stress (drought, salinity, and chilling). Integrating the vegetation index, a novel approach, contains information about the surface of plants and bioimpedance data, which indicates the internal changes of plants. The fusion of these two datasets was examined to classify the types and severity of stress. Among the eight supervised machine learning models (three linear and five non-linear), the support vector machine (SVM) exhibited the highest accuracy in classifying stress types. Bioimpedance spectroscopy alone exhibited an accuracy of 0.86 and improved to 0.90 when fused with vegetation indices. Additionally, for drought and salinity stresses, it was possible to classify the early stage of stress with accuracies of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. This study will allow us to classify the different types and severity of plant stress, prescribe appropriate treatment methods for efficient cost and time management of crop production, and potentially apply them to low-cost field measurement systems.",

The disturbances of metabolic pathways reflect the global profile of biological responses to ENPs but are difficult to predict due to the highly heterogeneous data from complicated biological systems and various ENP properties. Herein, integrating multiple machine learning models and metabolomics enabled accurate prediction of the disturbance of metabolic pathways induced by 33 ENPs. Screening nine typical properties of ENPs identified type and size as the top features determining the effects on metabolic pathways. Similarity network analysis and decision tree models overcame the highly heterogeneous data sources to visualize and judge the occurrence of metabolic pathways depending on the sorting priority features. The model accuracy was verified by animal experiments and reached 75%-100%, even for the prediction of ENPs outside of databases. The models also predicted metabolic pathway-related histopathology.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct data sharing, facilitating knowledge exchange while ensuring data privacy. Multimodal federated learning (MFL) is particularly advantageous for decentralized multimodal data, effectively managing heterogeneous information across modalities. However, the diversity in environments and data collection methods among participating devices introduces substantial challenges due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Our experiments reveal that, despite the theoretical benefits of multimodal data, MFL under non-IID conditions often exhibits poor performance, even trailing traditional unimodal FL approaches. Additionally, MFL frequently encounter missing modality issues, further complicating the training process. To address these challenges, we propose several improvements: the federated self-attention multimodal (FSM) feature fusion method and the multimodal federated learning adaptive continual update (FedMAC) algorithm. Moreover, we utilize a Stable Diffusion model to mitigate the impact of missing image modality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform other state-of-the-art FL algorithms, enhancing both accuracy and robustness in MFL.",

    "abstract": "PM concentration is an important indicator to measure the concentration of air pollutants, and it is of important social significance and application value to realize accurate prediction of PM concentration. To further improve the accuracy of PM concentration prediction, this paper proposes a hybrid machine learning model (WD-SA-LSTM-BP model) based on simulated annealing (SA) optimization and wavelet decomposition. Firstly, the wavelet decomposition algorithm was used to realize the multiscale decomposition and single-branch reconstruction of PM concentrations to weaken the prediction error caused by time series data. Secondly, the SA optimization method was used to optimize the super-parameters of each machine learning model under each reconstructed component, so as to solve the problem that it is difficult to determine the parameters of machine learning model. Thirdly, the optimized machine learning model was used to predict the PM concentration, and the error value was calculated from the actual measured value. Then, the optimized machine learning model was used to predict the error value. Finally, the predicted error value was added to the predicted PM concentration to obtain the final predicted PM concentration. The study is experimentally validated based on daily PM data collected from Nanjing air quality monitoring stations. The experimental results showed that the RMSE and MAE values of the constructed WD-SA-LSTM-BP model were 5.26 and 3.72, respectively, which were superior to those of the WD-LSTM and LSTM models, indicating that the hybrid machine learning model based on SA optimization and wavelet decomposition could better predict the PM concentration.",

    "title": "Automatic diagnosis and grading of Prostate Cancer with weakly supervised learning on whole slide images.",
    "abstract": "The workflow of prostate cancer diagnosis and grading is cumbersome and the results suffer from substantial inter-observer variability. Recent trials have shown potential in using machine learning to develop automated systems to address this challenge. Most automated deep learning systems for prostate cancer Gleason grading focused on supervised learning requiring demanding fine-grained pixel-level annotations. A weakly-supervised deep learning model with slide-level labels is presented in this study for the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer with whole slide image (WSI). WSIs are first cropped into small patches and then processed with a deep learning model to extract patch-level features. A graph convolution network (GCN) is used to aggregate the features for classifications. Throughout the training process, the noisy labels are progressively filtered out to reduce inter-observer variations in clinical reports. Finally, multi-center independent test cohorts with 6,174 slides are collected to evaluate the prostate cancer diagnosis and grading performance of our model. The cancer diagnosis (2-level classification) results on two external test sets (n= 4,675, n= 844) show an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.985 and 0.986. The Gleason grading (6-level classification) results reach 0.931 quadratic weighted kappa on the internal test set (n= 531). It generalizes well on the external test dataset (n= 844) with 0.801 quadratic weighted kappa with the reference standard set independently. The model enables pathological meaningful interpretability by visualizing the most attended lesions which are highly consistent with expert annotations. The proposed model incorporates a graph network in weakly supervised learning with only slide-level reports. A robust learning strategy is also employed to correct the label noise. It is highly accurate (>0.985 AUC for diagnosis) and also interpretable with intuitive heatmap visualization. It can be unified with a digital pathology pipeline to deliver prostate cancer metrics for a pathology report.",

    "title": "Machine learning based predictive model for the analysis of sequence activity relationships using protein spectra and protein descriptors.",
    "abstract": "Accurately establishing the connection between a protein sequence and its function remains a focal point within the field of protein engineering, especially in the context of predicting the effects of mutations. From this, there has been a continued drive to build accurate and reliable predictive models via machine learning that allow for the virtual screening of many protein mutant sequences, measuring the relationship between sequence and 'fitness' or 'activity', commonly known as a Sequence-Activity-Relationship (SAR). An important preliminary stage in the building of these predictive models is the encoding of the chosen sequences. Evaluated in this work is a plethora of encoding strategies using the Amino Acid Index database, where the indices are transformed into their spectral form via Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques, as well as numerous protein structural and physiochemical descriptors. The encoding strategies are explored on a dataset curated to measure the thermostability of various mutants from a recombination library, designed from parental cytochrome P450s. In this work it was concluded that the implementation of protein spectra in concatenation with protein descriptors, together with the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) algorithm, gave the most noteworthy increase in the quality of the predictive models (as described in Encoding Strategy C), highlighting their utility in identifying an SAR. The accompanying software produced for this paper is termed pySAR (Python Sequence-Activity-Relationship), which allows for a user to find the optimal arrangement of structural and or physiochemical properties to encode their specific mutant library dataset; the source code is available at: https://github.com/amckenna41/pySAR.",

    "title": "Machine-Learning Predictions of Critical Temperatures from Chemical Compositions of Superconductors.",
    "abstract": "In the quest for advanced superconducting materials, the accurate prediction of critical temperatures ( ) poses a formidable challenge, largely due to the complex interdependencies between superconducting properties and the chemical and structural characteristics of a given material. To address this challenges, we have developed a machine-learning framework that aims to elucidate these complicated and hitherto poorly understood structure-property and property-property relationships. This study introduces a novel machine-learning-based workflow, termed the Gradient Boosted Feature Selection (GBFS), which has been tailored to predict for superconductors by employing a distributed gradient-boosting framework. This approach integrates exploratory data analyses, statistical evaluations, and multicollinearity reduction techniques to select highly relevant features from a high-dimensional feature space, derived solely from the chemical composition of materials. Our methodology was rigorously tested on a data set comprising approximately 16,400 chemical compounds with around 12,000 unique chemical compositions. The GBFS workflow enabled the development of a classification model that distinguishes compositions likely to exhibit values greater than 10 K. This model achieved a weighted average F1-score of 0.912, an AUC-ROC of 0.986, and an average precision score of 0.919. Additionally, the GBFS workflow underpinned a regression model that predicted values with an of 0.945, an MAE of 3.54 K, and an RMSE of 6.57 K on a test set obtained via random splitting. Further exploration was conducted through out-of-sample predictions, particularly those exceeding the liquid nitrogen temperature, and out-of-distribution predictions for (Ca La )FeAs based on varying lanthanum content. The outcome of our study underscores the significance of systematic feature analysis and selection in enhancing predictive model performance, offering various advantages over models that rely primarily on algorithmic complexity. This research not only advances the field of superconductivity but also sets a precedent for the application of machine learning in materials science.",

Overall, the comparative analysis is carried out in 65 classification models, i.e., 13 in deep feature extraction, 13 in transfer learning, and 39 in the machine learning approaches.

    "abstract": "Pooling is a key mechanism in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which helps to achieve translation invariance. Numerous studies, both empirically and theoretically, show that pooling consistently boosts the performance of the CNNs. The conventional pooling methods are operated on activation values. In this work, we alternatively propose rank-based pooling. It is derived from the observations that ranking list is invariant under changes of activation values in a pooling region, and thus rank-based pooling operation may achieve more robust performance. In addition, the reasonable usage of rank can avoid the scale problems encountered by value-based methods. The novel pooling mechanism can be regarded as an instance of weighted pooling where a weighted sum of activations is used to generate the pooling output. This pooling mechanism can also be realized as rank-based average pooling (RAP), rank-based weighted pooling (RWP) and rank-based stochastic pooling (RSP) according to different weighting strategies. As another major contribution, we present a novel criterion to analyze the discriminant ability of various pooling methods, which is heavily under-researched in machine learning and computer vision community. Experimental results on several image benchmarks show that rank-based pooling outperforms the existing pooling methods in classification performance. We further demonstrate better performance on CIFAR datasets by integrating RSP into Network-in-Network.",

    "title": "Hybrid Harris hawks optimization with cuckoo search for drug design and discovery in chemoinformatics.",
    "abstract": "One of the major drawbacks of cheminformatics is a large amount of information present in the datasets. In the majority of cases, this information contains redundant instances that affect the analysis of similarity measurements with respect to drug design and discovery. Therefore, using classical methods such as the protein bank database and quantum mechanical calculations are insufficient owing to the dimensionality of search spaces. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called CHHO-CS, which combines Harris hawks optimizer (HHO) with two operators: cuckoo search (CS) and chaotic maps. The role of CS is to control the main position vectors of the HHO algorithm to maintain the balance between exploitation and exploration phases, while the chaotic maps are used to update the control energy parameters to avoid falling into local optimum and premature convergence. Feature selection (FS) is a tool that permits to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by removing redundant and non desired information, then FS is very helpful in cheminformatics. FS methods employ a classifier that permits to identify the best subset of features. The support vector machines (SVMs) are then used by the proposed CHHO-CS as an objective function for the classification process in FS. The CHHO-CS-SVM is tested in the selection of appropriate chemical descriptors and compound activities. Various datasets are used to validate the efficiency of the proposed CHHO-CS-SVM approach including ten from the UCI machine learning repository. Additionally, two chemical datasets (i.e., quantitative structure-activity relation biodegradation and monoamine oxidase) were utilized for selecting the most significant chemical descriptors and chemical compounds activities. The extensive experimental and statistical analyses exhibit that the suggested CHHO-CS method accomplished much-preferred trade-off solutions over the competitor algorithms including the HHO, CS, particle swarm optimization, moth-flame optimization, grey wolf optimizer, Salp swarm algorithm, and sine-cosine algorithm surfaced in the literature. The experimental results proved that the complexity associated with cheminformatics can be handled using chaotic maps and hybridizing the meta-heuristic methods.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the key components of cognitive architectures (declarative and procedural memory) and their key capabilities (learning, memory retrieval, probability judgment, and utility estimation) can be implemented as algebraic operations on vectors and tensors in a high-dimensional space using a distributional semantics model. High-dimensional vector spaces underlie the success of modern machine learning techniques based on deep learning. However, while neural networks have an impressive ability to process data to find patterns, they do not typically model high-level cognition, and it is often unclear how they work. Symbolic cognitive architectures can capture the complexities of high-level cognition and provide human-readable, explainable models, but scale poorly to naturalistic, non-symbolic, or big data. Vector-symbolic architectures, where symbols are represented as vectors, bridge the gap between the two approaches. We posit that cognitive architectures, if implemented in a vector-space model, represent a useful, explanatory model of the internal representations of otherwise opaque neural architectures. Our proposed model, Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM), is a vector-space model based on distributional semantics. HDM accounts for primacy and recency effects in free recall, the fan effect in recognition, probability judgments, and human performance on an iterated decision task. HDM provides a flexible, scalable alternative to symbolic cognitive architectures at a level of description that bridges symbolic, quantum, and neural models of cognition.",

Hence, we propose a mixed-supervised method incorporating semi-supervision and \"human-in-the-loop\" for cell classification. We design a sample selection mechanism that assigns highly confident unlabeled samples to automatic semi-supervised optimization and unreliable ones for online annotation correction. We use prior human annotations to pretrain the backbone and trustworthy pseudo labels and online human annotations to fine-tune the model for accurate cell classification. Experimental results show that the mixed-supervised model reaches overall accuracies as high as 86.56%, 99.33% and 74.12% on LUSC, BloodCell, and PanNuke datasets, respectively.",

Analyses of the literature from 2010 to 2018 yielded 1849 pertinent articles, of which we selected 141 for detailed review. We propose a functional taxonomy for diabetes management and artificial intelligence. Additionally, a detailed analysis of each subject category was performed using related key outcomes. This approach revealed that the experiments and studies reviewed yielded encouraging results. We obtained evidence of an acceleration of research activity aimed at developing artificial intelligence-powered tools for prediction and prevention of complications associated with diabetes. Our results indicate that artificial intelligence methods are being progressively established as suitable for use in clinical daily practice, as well as for the self-management of diabetes. Consequently, these methods provide powerful tools for improving patients' quality of life.",

    "title": "Discrimination between RA and LA Sinus Rhythms using machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease that potentially leads to fatal conditions. Machine Learning (ML) classification methods are widely used to distinguish between sinus rhythm and AF for post-ablation rhythms in ECG. However, intracardiac electrograms (iEGMs) recorded in the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) might have different sinus rhythms characteristics. In this work, we demonstrate a method to evaluate the iEGMs in the high-dimensional parameter space and effectively discriminate between the sinus rhythms recorded from LA and RA by extracting the features from the time series and using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-means clustering. We also demonstrate that the rhythms in LA post ablations exhibit a similar distribution in feature space to that of the sinus RA. The classification has achieved an accuracy of 90.15% for the non-supervised K-Means cluster. It marks the difference between LA and RA baseline and provides insights into signal identification using iEGMs.",

    "title": "Recent Advances in Large Margin Learning.",
    "abstract": "This paper serves as a survey of recent advances in large margin training and its theoretical foundations, mostly for (nonlinear) deep neural networks (DNNs) that are probably the most prominent machine learning models for large-scale data in the community over the past decade. We generalize the formulation of classification margins from classical research to latest DNNs, summarize theoretical connections between the margin, network generalization, and robustness, and introduce recent efforts in enlarging the margins for DNNs comprehensively. Since the viewpoint of different methods is discrepant, we categorize them into groups for ease of comparison and discussion in the paper. Hopefully, our discussions and overview inspire new research work in the community that aim to improve the performance of DNNs, and we also point to directions where the large margin principle can be verified to provide theoretical evidence why certain regularizations for DNNs function well in practice. We managed to shorten the paper such that the crucial spirit of large margin learning and related methods are better emphasized.",

    "abstract": "We report an experimental design issue in recent machine learning formulations of the enhancer-promoter interaction problem arising from the fact that many enhancer-promoter pairs share features. Cross-fold validation schemes which do not correctly separate these feature sharing enhancer-promoter pairs into one test set report high accuracy, which is actually arising from high training set accuracy and a failure to properly evaluate generalization performance. Cross-fold validation schemes which properly segregate pairs with shared features show markedly reduced ability to predict enhancer-promoter interactions from epigenomic state. Parameter scans with multiple models indicate that local epigenomic features of individual pairs of enhancers and promoters cannot distinguish those pairs that interact from those which do with high accuracy, suggesting that additional information is required to predict enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Performing simulated snoring (SS) is a commonly used method to evaluate the source of snoring in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SS sounds is considered as a potential biomarker for OSA. SS sounds can be easily recorded, which is a cost-effective method for prescreening purposes. This study aimed to validate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models using SS sounds for OSA diagnosis. All participants underwent full-night polysomnography (PSG) monitoring at the sleep center. SS sounds of the participants were recorded during the laryngoscopy procedure. The audio data were processed via Python, and relevant features were extracted. OSA diagnostic models were developed using three machine learning (ML) algorithms and one deep learning (DL) algorithm. The diagnostic performance was evaluated by multiple indicators. A total of 465 participants were included. For the support vector machine algorithm, the accuracy values at apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.914, 0.887, and 0.807, respectively. For the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.896, 0.872, and 0.756, respectively. For the random forest algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.905, 0.881, and 0.804, respectively. For the audio spectrogram transformer algorithm, the accuracy values at AHI levels of 5, 15, and 30 per hour were 0.926, 0.887, and 0.830, respectively. Our study demonstrates that DL models can effectively screen and identify OSA with commendable performance. In addition, the identification ability of the DL models was better than that of any of the ML models.",

    "title": "Comparison of Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning Models for Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition characterized by a decline in cognitive ability and progression of cognitive impairment. It is often considered a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to compare deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) methods in predicting MCI using plasma proteomic biomarkers. A total of 239 adults were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort along with a pool of 146 plasma proteomic biomarkers. We evaluated seven traditional ML models (support vector machines (SVMs), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) and six variations of a deep neural network (DNN) model-the DL model in the H2O package. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selected 35 proteomic biomarkers from the pool. Based on grid search, the DNN model with an activation function of \"Rectifier With Dropout\" with 2 layers and 32 of 35 selected proteomic biomarkers revealed the best model with the highest accuracy of 0.995 and an F1 Score of 0.996, while among seven traditional ML methods, XGBoost was the best with an accuracy of 0.986 and an F1 Score of 0.985. Several biomarkers were correlated with the - genotype, polygenic hazard score (PHS), and three clinical cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Aβ42, tTau, and pTau). Bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed several molecular functions and pathways associated with the selected biomarkers, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cholesterol metabolism, and regulation of lipid localization. The results showed that the DL model may represent a promising tool in the prediction of MCI. These plasma proteomic biomarkers may help with early diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, and early treatment interventions for individuals at risk for MCI.",

    "title": "Closing the Control Loop with Time-Variant Embedded Soft Sensors and Recurrent Neural Networks.",
    "abstract": "Embedded soft sensors can significantly impact the design and control of soft-bodied robots. Although there have been considerable advances in technology behind these novel sensing materials, their application in real-world tasks, especially in closed-loop control tasks, has been severely limited. This is mainly because of the challenge involved with modeling a nonlinear time-variant sensor embedded in a complex soft-bodied system. This article presents a learning-based approach for closed-loop force control with embedded soft sensors and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We present learning protocols for training a class of RNNs called long short-term memory (LSTM) that allows us to develop accurate and robust state estimation models of these complex dynamical systems within a short period of time. Using this model, we develop a simple feedback force controller for a soft anthropomorphic finger even with significant drift and hysteresis in our feedback signal. Simulation and experimental studies are conducted to analyze the capabilities and generalizability of the control architecture. Experimentally, we are able to develop a closed-loop controller with a control frequency of 25 Hz and an average accuracy of 0.17 N. Our results indicate that current soft sensing technologies can already be used in real-world applications with the aid of machine learning techniques and an appropriate training methodology.",

    "title": "Multi-Layered Filtration Framework for Efficient Detection of Network Attacks Using Machine Learning.",
    "abstract": "The advancements and reliance on digital data necessitates dependence on information technology. The growing amount of digital data and their availability over the Internet have given rise to the problem of information security. With the increase in connectivity among devices and networks, maintaining the information security of an asset has now become essential for an organization. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are widely used in networks for protection against different network attacks. Several machine-learning-based techniques have been used among researchers for the implementation of anomaly-based IDS (AIDS). In the past, the focus primarily remained on the improvement of the accuracy of the system. Efficiency with respect to time is an important aspect of an IDS, which most of the research has thus far somewhat overlooked. For this purpose, we propose a multi-layered filtration framework (MLFF) for feature reduction using a statistical approach. The proposed framework helps reduce the detection time without affecting the accuracy. We use the CIC-IDS2017 dataset for experiments. The proposed framework contains three filters and is connected in sequential order. The accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are calculated against the selected machine learning models. In addition, the training time and the detection time are also calculated because these parameters are considered important in measuring the performance of a detection system. Generally, decision tree models, random forest methods, and artificial neural networks show better results in the detection of network attacks with minimum detection time.",

Realization of this objective is contingent on the ability to demonstrate quality and safety of the cellular product for its intended use. Bottlenecks and backlogs to the clinical use of iPSCs have been fully outlined and a need has emerged for safer and standardized protocols to trigger cell reprogramming and functional differentiation. Amidst great challenges, in particular associated with lengthy culture time and laborious cell characterization, a demand for faster and more accurate methods for the validation of cell identity and function at different stages of the iPSC manufacturing process has risen. Artificial intelligence-based methods are proving helpful for these complex tasks and might revolutionize the way iPSCs are managed to create surrogate cells and organs. Here, we briefly review recent progress in artificial intelligence approaches for evaluation of iPSCs and their derivatives in experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose- The prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients may be useful in treatment decisions. Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions- Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.",

    "abstract": "The most common approaches to discovering genes associated with specific diseases are based on machine learning and use a variety of feature selection techniques to identify significant genes that can serve as biomarkers for a given disease. More recently, the integration in this process of prior knowledge-based approaches has shown significant promise in the discovery of new biomarkers with potential translational applications. In this study, we developed a novel approach, GediNET, that integrates prior biological knowledge to gene Groups that are shown to be associated with a specific disease such as a cancer. The novelty of GediNET is that it then also allows the discovery of significant associations between that specific disease and other diseases. The initial step in this process involves the identification of gene Groups. The Groups are then subjected to a Scoring component to identify the top performing classification Groups. The top-ranked gene Groups are then used to train a Machine Learning Model. The process of Grouping, Scoring and Modelling (G-S-M) is used by GediNET to identify other diseases that are similarly associated with this signature. GediNET identifies these relationships through Disease-Disease Association (DDA) based machine learning. DDA explores novel associations between diseases and identifies relationships which could be used to further improve approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

    "abstract": "On the one hand, complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches emphasize that people, as complex adaptive systems, are ambiguous, indeterminable, and inherently unpredictable. On the other, Machine Learning (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable. When ML systems \"pick up\" patterns and clusters, this often amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.",

We explore the critical effects that changes in certain parameters can have on the reservoir computers' ability to express multifunctionality.

But when Jumper and Hassabis added a brew of innovative neural network-based machine learning approaches to the mix, the results were explosive. Realizing the half-century-old dream of predicting protein structure has already accelerated the pace and creativity of many areas of Chemistry, Biology, and Medicine.",

    "title": "AI analysis for ejection fraction estimation from 12-lead ECG.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) remains a leading global cause of cardiovascular deaths, with its prevalence expected to rise in the upcoming decade. Measuring the heart ejection fraction (EF) is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring HF. Although echocardiography is the gold standard for EF measurement, it is often inaccessible in remote areas due to its cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is more readily available and affordable, and emerging research suggests a possible link between ECG signals and EF. In this work, we explore the potential of 12-lead ECG signals to estimate EF using various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. While recent studies have considered the use of ML or DL for estimating EF, these algorithms are often trained and tested on urban-based populations. However, demographics like those in rural Appalachia, where disease prevalence is extremely high, have been overlooked, potentially due to the unavailability of large volumes of data. Moreover, there have been concerning reports regarding the fairness of AI predictions across different populations, making it crucial to understand the performance of AI models across diverse demographics before their widespread application. To address this, our study focuses on analyzing AI models for EF estimation in the rural Appalachian population. We utilized a 12-lead ECG dataset of 55,500 patients from WVU Medicine hospitals in West Virginia and employed a wide array of AI algorithms, ranging from Random Forest to modern deep learning-based methods like Transformers, to estimate EF. We also considered different thresholds for analyzing these AI algorithms and examined the impact of single and multi-lead ECG signals, and conducted model interpretability analysis. Overall, our comprehensive analysis demonstrated that deep learning-based algorithms achieved the highest performance, with an AUROC of around 0.86 for EF estimation from 12-lead ECG signals. Additionally, we found that while individual ECG leads were insufficient for accurate EF estimation, specific lead combinations significantly improved classification performance.",

    "abstract": "The development of embryonic cells involves several continuous stages, and some genes are related to embryogenesis. To date, few studies have systematically investigated changes in gene expression profiles during mammalian embryogenesis. In this study, a computational analysis using machine learning algorithms was performed on the gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic cells at seven stages. First, the profiles were analyzed through a powerful Monte Carlo feature selection method for the generation of a feature list. Second, increment feature selection was applied on the list by incorporating two classification algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER). Through SVM, we extracted several latent gene biomarkers, indicating the stages of embryonic cells, and constructed an optimal SVM classifier that produced a nearly perfect classification of embryonic cells. Furthermore, some interesting rules were accessed by the RIPPER algorithm, suggesting different expression patterns for different stages.",

    "title": "A Topology-Enhanced Multi-Viewed Contrastive Approach for Molecular Graph Representation Learning and Classification.",
    "abstract": "In recent times, graph representation learning has been becoming a hot research topic which has attracted a lot of attention from researchers. Graph embeddings have diverse applications across fields such as information and social network analysis, bioinformatics and cheminformatics, natural language processing (NLP), and recommendation systems. Among the advanced deep learning (DL) based architectures used in graph representation learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant and highly effective framework. The recent GNN-based methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on complex supervised and unsupervised tasks at both the node and graph levels. In recent years, to enhance multi-view and structured graph representations, contrastive learning-based techniques have been developed, introducing models known as graph contrastive learning (GCL) models. These GCL approaches leverage unsupervised contrastive methods to capture multi-view graph representations by comparing node and graph embeddings, yielding significant improvements in both graph-level representations and task-specific applications, such as molecular embedding and classification. However, as most GCL techniques are primarily designed to focus on the explicit graph structure through GNN-based encoders, they often overlook critical topological insights that could be provided through topological data analysis (TDA). Given the promising research indicating that topological features can greatly benefit various graph learning tasks, we propose a novel topology-enhanced, multi-view graph contrastive learning model called TMGCL. Our TMGCL model is designed to capture and utilize both comprehensive multi-scale topological and global structural information from graphs. This enhanced representation capability positions TMGCL to directly support a range of applications, such as molecular classification, with improved accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments within two real-world datasets proved the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed TMGCL in comparing with state-of-the-art GNN/GCL-based baselines.",

    "abstract": "New enzyme functions exist within the increasing number of unannotated protein sequences. Novel enzyme discovery is necessary to expand the pathways that can be accessed by metabolic engineering for the biosynthesis of functional compounds. Accordingly, various machine learning models have been developed to predict enzymatic reactions. However, the ability to predict unknown reactions that are not included in the training data has not been clarified. In order to cover uncertain and unknown reactions, a wider range of reaction types must be demonstrated by the models. Here, we establish 16 expanded enzymatic reaction prediction models developed using various machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network. Improvements in prediction performances over that of our previous study indicate that the updated methods are more effective for the prediction of enzymatic reactions. Overall, the deep neural network model trained with combined substrate-enzyme-product information exhibits the highest prediction accuracy with Macro F scores up to 0.966 and with robust prediction of unknown enzymatic reactions that are not included in the training data. This model can predict more extensive enzymatic reactions in comparison to previously reported models. This study will facilitate the discovery of new enzymes for the production of useful substances.",

    "title": "Using machine learning to identify environmental factors that collectively determine microbial community structure of activated sludge.",
    "abstract": "Activated sludge (AS) microbial communities are influenced by various environmental variables. However, a comprehensive analysis of how these variables jointly and nonlinearly shape the AS microbial community remains challenging. In this study, we employed advanced machine learning techniques to elucidate the collective effects of environmental variables on the structure and function of AS microbial communities. Applying Dirichlet multinomial mixtures analysis to 311 global AS samples, we identified four distinct microbial community types (AS-types), each characterized by unique microbial compositions and metabolic profiles. We used 14 classical linear and nonlinear machine learning methods to select a baseline model. The extremely randomized trees demonstrated optimal performance in learning the relationship between environmental factors and AS types (with an accuracy of 71.43%). Feature selection identified critical environmental factors and their importance rankings, including latitude (Lat), longitude (Long), precipitation during sampling (Precip), solids retention time (SRT), effluent total nitrogen (Effluent TN), average temperature during sampling month (Avg Temp), mixed liquor temperature (Mixed Temp), influent biochemical oxygen demand (Influent BOD), and annual precipitation (Annual Precip). Significantly, Lat, Long, Precip, Avg Temp, and Annual Precip, influenced metabolic variations among AS types. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of environmental variables in shaping microbial community structures and enhancing metabolic pathways within activated sludge. Our study encourages the application of machine learning techniques to design artificial activated sludge microbial communities for specific environmental purposes.",

    "title": "IPC prediction of patent documents using neural network with attention for hierarchical structure.",
    "abstract": "International patent classifications (IPCs) are assigned to patent documents; however, since the procedure for assigning classifications is manually done by the patent examiner, it takes a lot of time and effort to select some IPCs from about 70,000 IPCs. Hence, some research has been conducted on patent classification with machine learning. However, patent documents are very voluminous, and learning with all the claims (the part describing the content of the patent) as input would run out of the necessary memory, even if the batch size is set to a very small size. Therefore, most of the existing methods learn by excluding some information, such as using only the first claim as input. In this study, we propose a model that considers the contents of all claims by extracting important information for input. In addition, we focus on the hierarchical structure of the IPC, and propose a new decoder architecture to consider it. Finally, we conducted an experiment using actual patent data to verify the accuracy of the prediction. The results showed a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods, and the actual applicability of the method was also discussed.",

    "title": "Confusion State Induction and EEG-based Detection in Learning.",
    "abstract": "Confusion, as an affective state, has been proved beneficial for learning, although this emotion is always mentioned as negative affect. Confusion causes the learner to solve the problem and overcome difficulties in order to restore the cognitive equilibrium. Once the confusion is successfully resolved, a deeper learning is generated. Therefore, quantifying and visualizing the confusion that occurs in learning as well as intervening has gained great interest by researchers. Among these researches, triggering confusion precisely and detecting it is the critical step and underlies other studies. In this paper, we explored the induction of confusion states and the feasibility of detecting confusion using EEG as a first step towards an EEG-based Brain Computer Interface for monitoring the confusion and intervening in the learning. 16 participants EEG data were recorded and used. Our experiment design to induce confusion was based on tests of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Each confusing and not-confusing test item was presented during 15 seconds and the raw EEG data was collected via Emotiv headset. To detect the confusion emotion in learning, we propose an end-to-end EEG analysis method. End-to-end classification of Deep Learning in Machine Learning has revolutionized computer vision, which has gained interest to adopt this method to EEG analysis. The result of this preliminary study was promising, which showed a 71.36% accuracy in classifying users' confused and unconfused states when they are inferring the rules in the tests.",

    "title": "Packet Flow Capacity Autonomous Operation Based on Reinforcement Learning.",
    "abstract": "As the dynamicity of the traffic increases, the need for self-network operation becomes more evident. One of the solutions that might bring cost savings to network operators is the dynamic capacity management of large packet flows, especially in the context of packet over optical networks. Machine Learning, particularly Reinforcement Learning, seems to be an enabler for autonomicity as a result of its inherent capacity to learn from experience. However, precisely because of that, RL methods might not be able to provide the required performance (e.g., delay, packet loss, and capacity overprovisioning) when managing the capacity of packet flows, until they learn the optimal policy. In view of that, we propose a management lifecycle with three phases: (i) a self-tuned threshold-based approach operating just after the packet flow is set up and until enough data on the traffic characteristics are available; (ii) an RL operation based on models pre-trained with a generic traffic profile; and (iii) an RL operation with models trained for real traffic. Exhaustive simulation results confirm the poor performance of RL algorithms until the optimal policy is learnt and when traffic characteristics change over time, which prevents deploying such methods in operators' networks. In contrast, the proposed lifecycle outperforms benchmarking approaches, achieving noticeable performance from the beginning of operation while showing robustness against traffic changes.",

A hybrid model that combined predictions by both approaches by simple averaging performed better than either method, with respect to both ranking and absolute p values. Two publicly available FEP benchmarks, covering 16 diverse biological targets, were used to test the generality of the synergy. By identifying training data specifically focused on relevant ligands, accurate QuanSA models were derived using ligand activity data known at the time of the original series publications. Results across the 16 benchmark targets demonstrated significant improvements both for ranking and for absolute p values using hybrid predictions that combined the FEP and QuanSA predicted affinity values. The results argue for a combined approach for affinity prediction that makes use of physics-driven methods as well as those driven by machine learning, each applied carefully on appropriate compounds, with hybrid prediction strategies being employed where possible.",

    "abstract": "Liquid biopsy (LB) technologies continue to improve in sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexing and can measure an ever growing library of disease biomarkers. However, clinical interpretation of the increasingly large sets of data these technologies generate remains a challenge. Machine learning is a popular approach to discover and detect signatures of disease. However, limited machine learning expertise in the LB field has kept the discipline from fully leveraging these tools and risks improper analyses and irreproducible results. In this paper, we develop a web-based automated machine learning tool tailored specifically for LB, where machine learning models can be built without the user's input. We also incorporate a differential privacy algorithm, designed to limit the effects of overfitting that can arise from users iteratively developing a panel with feedback from our platform. We validate our approach by performing a meta-analysis on 11 published LB datasets, and found that we had similar or better performance compared to those reported in the literature. Moreover, we show that our platform's performance improved when incorporating information from prior LB datasets, suggesting that this approach can continue to improve with increased access to LB data. Finally, we show that by using our platform the results achieved in the literature can be matched using 40% of the number of subjects in the training set, potentially reducing study cost and time.

    "abstract": "Drug discovery for diseases such as Parkinson's disease are impeded by the lack of screenable cellular phenotypes. We present an unbiased phenotypic profiling platform that combines automated cell culture, high-content imaging, Cell Painting, and deep learning. We applied this platform to primary fibroblasts from 91 Parkinson's disease patients and matched healthy controls, creating the largest publicly available Cell Painting image dataset to date at 48 terabytes. We use fixed weights from a convolutional deep neural network trained on ImageNet to generate deep embeddings from each image and train machine learning models to detect morphological disease phenotypes. Our platform's robustness and sensitivity allow the detection of individual-specific variation with high fidelity across batches and plate layouts. Lastly, our models confidently separate LRRK2 and sporadic Parkinson's disease lines from healthy controls (receiver operating characteristic area under curve 0.79 (0.08 standard deviation)), supporting the capacity of this platform for complex disease modeling and drug screening applications.",

Bifurcation analysis of these nonlinear systems on the parameter space is usually used to study the solution structure, such as the number of solutions and the stability. In this paper, we develop a new machine learning approach to compute the bifurcations via so-called equation-driven neural networks (EDNNs). The EDNNs consist of a two-step optimization: the first step is to approximate the solution function of the parameter by training empirical solution data; the second step is to compute bifurcations using the approximated neural network obtained in the first step. Both theoretical convergence analysis and numerical implementation on several examples have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.",

The unique autofluorescence properties of bacterial cells are exploited for rapid and cost-effective identification that is suitable for point-of-care applications. Fluorescence spectroscopy is combined with machine learning to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Good training data for machine learning can be obtained to achieve the same diagnostic accuracy for bacterial species as when each wavelength is measured in detail over a broad spectral width. Experiments were performed testing 14 bacterial strains. The excitation-emission matrix was analyzed, and Bayesian optimization was used to identify the most effective combinations of wavelengths. The results showed that fluorescence spectra using three specific excitation light regions or excitation spectra using two broad fluorescence detection regions could be used as supervised data to realize diagnostic accuracy comparable to that obtained with more complex instruments.",

    "abstract": "Breast imaging has several modalities, each unique in terms of its imaging position, evaluation index, and imaging method. Breast diagnosis is made by combining a large number of past imaging features with the clinical course and histological findings. Artificial intelligence (AI), which extracts the features from image data and evaluates them based on comprehensive analysis, has been making rapid progress in this regard. Many previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness and development potential of AI, such as machine learning and deep learning, in breast imaging. However, despite studies showing the good performance of AI models, their overall utilization remains low, since a large amount of diverse imaging data is required, and prospective verification is necessary to prove its high reproducibility and robustness. Sharing information and collaborating with multiple institutions to collect and verify images of different conditions and backgrounds are vital. If image diagnosis using AI can indeed ensure a more detailed diagnosis, such as breast cancer subtypes or prognosis, it can help develop personalized medicine, which is urgently required. The positive results of AI research, using such image information, can make each modality more valuable than ever. The current review summarized the results of previous studies using AI in each evaluation field and discussed the related future prospects.",

    "title": "An Integrated Smart Pond Water Quality Monitoring and Fish Farming Recommendation Aquabot System.",
    "abstract": "The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and machine learning (ML) has the potential to significantly enhance the productivity and profitability of traditional fish farming. Farmers using traditional fish farming methods incur enormous economic costs owing to labor-intensive schedule monitoring and care, illnesses, and sudden fish deaths. Another ongoing issue is automated fish species recommendation based on water quality. On the one hand, the effective monitoring of abrupt changes in water quality may minimize the daily operating costs and boost fish productivity, while an accurate automatic fish recommender may aid the farmer in selecting profitable fish species for farming. In this paper, we present AquaBot, an IoT-based system that can automatically collect, monitor, and evaluate the water quality and recommend appropriate fish to farm depending on the values of various water quality indicators. A mobile robot has been designed to collect parameter values such as the pH, temperature, and turbidity from all around the pond. To facilitate monitoring, we have developed web and mobile interfaces. For the analysis and recommendation of suitable fish based on water quality, we have trained and tested several ML algorithms, such as the proposed custom ensemble model, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), bagging, boosting, and stacking, on a real-time pond water dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed with feature scaling and dataset balancing. We have evaluated the algorithms based on several performance metrics. In our experiment, our proposed ensemble model has delivered the best result, with 94% accuracy, 94% precision, 94% recall, a 94% F1-score, 93% MCC, and the best AUC score for multi-class classification. Finally, we have deployed the best-performing model in a web interface to provide cultivators with recommendations for suitable fish farming. Our proposed system is projected to not only boost production and save money but also reduce the time and intensity of the producer's manual labor.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of object classifiers can significantly drop when the training data (source domain) and the application scenario (target domain) have inherent differences. Therefore, adapting the classifiers to the scenario in which they must operate is of paramount importance. We present novel domain adaptation (DA) methods for object detection. As proof of concept, we focus on adapting the state-of-the-art deformable part-based model (DPM) for pedestrian detection. We introduce an adaptive structural SVM (A-SSVM) that adapts a pre-learned classifier between different domains. By taking into account the inherent structure in feature space (e.g., the parts in a DPM), we propose a structure-aware A-SSVM (SA-SSVM). Neither A-SSVM nor SA-SSVM needs to revisit the source-domain training data to perform the adaptation. Rather, a low number of target-domain training examples (e.g., pedestrians) are used. To address the scenario where there are no target-domain annotated samples, we propose a self-adaptive DPM based on a self-paced learning (SPL) strategy and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Two types of adaptation tasks are assessed: from both synthetic pedestrians and general persons (PASCAL VOC) to pedestrians imaged from an on-board camera. Results show that our proposals avoid accuracy drops as high as 15 points when comparing adapted and non-adapted detectors.",

For the methane yield and maximum methane production rate, the gradient boosting decision tree produced R values of 0.84 and 0.69, respectively. According to feature analysis, digestion time and particle size had a substantial impact on the methane yield and production rate, respectively. When particle sizes were in the range of 0.3-0.5 mm and the specific surface area was approximately 290 m /g, corresponding to a range of O content (>31%) and biochar addition (>20 g/L), the maximum promotion of methane yield and maximum methane production rate were attained. Therefore, this study presents new insights into the effects of biochar on anaerobic digestion through tree-based machine learning.",

Although increasing studies of traditional machine learning (TML) and deep learning (DL) were conducted in the field of diagnosing LSS and gained prominent results, the performance of these models has not been analyzed systematically. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to pool the results and evaluate the heterogeneity of the current studies in using TML or DL models to diagnose LSS, thereby providing more comprehensive information for further clinical application. This review was performed under the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using articles extracted from PubMed, Embase databases, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies that evaluated DL or TML algorithms assessment value on diagnosing LSS were included, while those with duplicated or unavailable data were excluded. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 was used to estimate the risk of bias in each study. The MIDAS module and the METAPROP module of Stata (StataCorp) were used for data synthesis and statistical analyses. A total of 12 studies with 15,044 patients reported the assessment value of TML or DL models for diagnosing LSS. The risk of bias assessment yielded 4 studies with high risk of bias, 3 with unclear risk of bias, and 5 with completely low risk of bias. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86; I =99.06%) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.90; I =98.7%), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 36 (95% CI 26-49), the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 6.6 (95% CI 5.1-8.4), and the negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.18 (95% CI 0.16-0.21). The summary receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve of TML or DL models for diagnosing LSS of 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94), indicating a high diagnostic value. This systematic review and meta-analysis emphasize that despite the generally satisfactory diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence systems in the experimental stage for the diagnosis of LSS, none of them is reliable and practical enough to apply in real clinical practice. Further efforts, including optimization of model balance, widely accepted objective reference standards, multimodal strategy, large dataset for training and testing, external validation, and sufficient and scientific report, should be made to bridge the distance between current TML or DL models and real-life clinical applications in future studies.

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging. A component of diagnosis tool development is the design of effective classification models with Mass spectrometry (MS) data. Some Machine Learning approaches have been investigated but these models require time-consuming preprocessing steps to remove artifacts, making them unsuitable for rapid analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to perform well under such circumstances since they can learn representations from raw data. However, their effectiveness decreases when the number of available training samples is small, which is a common situation in medicine. In this work, we investigate transfer learning on 1D-CNNs, then we develop a cumulative learning method when transfer learning is not powerful enough. We propose to train the same model through several classification tasks over various small datasets to accumulate knowledge in the resulting representation. By using rat brain as the initial training dataset, a cumulative learning approach can have a classification accuracy exceeding 98% for 1D clinical MS-data. We show the use of cumulative learning using datasets generated in different biological contexts, on different organisms, and acquired by different instruments. Here we show a promising strategy for improving MS data classification accuracy when only small numbers of samples are available.",

It aims to integrate deep and classic machine learning features into a single model, exploring the proper structure and training procedure. From the initial 88 253 signals, only 84 210 were included. Low quality and unscored recordings were excluded. Three different database subsets of 40 365 recording each were created by dividing in three normal sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia recordings. Each subset was used to train a different model with shared architecture integrated as an ensemble to provide the final classification through major voting. Models contained a deep branch composed of a modified ResNet with dilation convolutional layers and squeeze and excitation Block that took as input windowed ECG signals. This was concatenated with a wide branch that integrated 20 cardiac rhythm features into a fully connected 3-layered network. Three different training steps were studied: just the deep branch (D), wide integration and training (D+W), and a final fine tuning of the deep branch posterior to wide training (D+W+D). Results obtained in a local test set formed by a stratified 12.5% split of the given full dataset were presented for 2-lead and 12-lead models. The best training method was the 3-step D + W + D procedure obtaining a challenge metric of 0.709 and 0.677 for 12 and 2-lead models respectively. Integration of handcrafted features and deep learning model not only may increase the generalization capacity of the network but also provide a path to add explicit information into the classification decision process. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work studying the training procedure to properly integrate both types of information for ECG signals classification.",

    "abstract": "Residential buildings consume a major portion of energy resources and hence are seriously involved in environmental pollution. In Iran, fossil fuel consumption is growing, such that it increased by more than 400% from 1990 to 2018. One of the fundamental solutions for reducing fossil fuel consumption and creating a healthy environment inside and outside buildings is implementing and developing green buildings. This study seeks to examine the barriers to and opportunities for developing green buildings and proposes a localized green standard appropriate for the conditions of Iran. To this end, the required parameters were identified using the opinions of experts and the Delphi method. The opinions of 81 building experts, including the employers, consultants, and contractors, were obtained using a three-part questionnaire. Based on the results from the machine learning method, the score of the localized green building in five dimensions, namely, site, water, energy, materials, and quality of the indoor environment was calculated to be 77.2, while the energy dimension was determined to be the most important green standard dimension with a significance coefficient of 0.548. In the ranking analysis of all parameters using the Friedman test, the parameters of energy consumption management, renewable energy usage, and thermal zoning received the highest scores among other factors. Furthermore, a lack of awareness on green buildings (77%) and a high potential for renewable energy production (81%) were respectively identified as the biggest barrier to and opportunity for the implementation of green buildings in Iran.",

Even after decades of work in the field, there is still very limited understanding of how to quantify, predict, and control the extent of agglomeration, owing to the complex interaction between the solvent and the solid particles and stochasticity imparted by mixing. Furthermore, a large size of industrial scale particulate process systems makes it computationally intractable. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel theory and computational methodology to predict the agglomeration extent by coupling the experimental measurements of agglomeration risk zone or \"sticky zone\" with discrete element method. The proposed model shows good agreement with experiments. Further, a machine learning model was built to predict agglomeration extent as a function of input variables, such as material properties and processing conditions, in order to build a digital twin of the unit operation. While the focus of the present study is the agglomeration of particles during industrial drying processes, the proposed methodology can be readily applied to numerous other particulate processes where agglomeration is either desired or undesired.",

    "abstract": "Relation extraction aims to discover relational facts about entity mentions from plain texts. In this work, we focus on clinical relation extraction; namely, given a medical record with mentions of drugs and their attributes, we identify relations between these entities. We propose a machine learning model with a novel set of knowledge-based and BioSentVec embedding features. We systematically investigate the impact of these features with standard distance- and word-based features, conducting experiments on two benchmark datasets of clinical texts from MADE 2018 and n2c2 2018 shared tasks. For comparison with the feature-based model, we utilize state-of-the-art models and three BERT-based models, including BioBERT and Clinical BERT. Our results demonstrate that distance and word features provide significant benefits to the classifier. Knowledge-based features improve classification results only for particular types of relations. The sentence embedding feature provides the largest improvement in results, among other explored features on the MADE corpus. The classifier obtains state-of-the-art performance in clinical relation extraction with F-measure of 92.6%, improving F-measure by 3.5% on the MADE corpus.",

    "abstract": "Several studies applying Machine Learning to deception detection have been published in the last decade. A rich and complex set of settings, approaches, theories, and results is now available. Therefore, one may find it difficult to identify trends, successful paths, gaps, and opportunities for contribution. The present literature review aims to provide the state of research regarding deception detection with Machine Learning. We followed the PRISMA protocol and retrieved 648 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. 540 of them were screened (108 were duplicates). A final corpus of 81 documents has been summarized as mind maps. Metadata was extracted and has been encoded as Python dictionaries to support a statistical analysis scripted in Python programming language, and available as a collection of Jupyter Lab Notebooks in a GitHub repository. All are available as Jupyter Lab Notebooks. Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbor are the five most explored techniques. The studies report a detection performance ranging from 51% to 100%, with 19 works reaching accuracy rate above 0.9. Monomodal, Bimodal, and Multimodal approaches were exploited and achieved various accuracy levels for detection. Bimodal and Multimodal approaches have become a trend over Monomodal ones, although there are high-performance examples of the latter. Studies that exploit language and linguistic features, 75% are dedicated to English. The findings include observations of the following: language and culture, emotional features, psychological traits, cognitive load, facial cues, complexity, performance, and Machine Learning topics. We also present a dataset benchmark. Main conclusions are that labeled datasets from real-life data are scarce. Also, there is still room for new approaches for deception detection with Machine Learning, especially if focused on languages and cultures other than English-based. Further research would greatly contribute by providing new labeled and multimodal datasets for deception detection, both for English and other languages.",

    "title": "Comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of brain metastases across several primary cancers using machine learning and deep learning models.",
    "abstract": "Brain metastases (BM) are associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality rates, making them a significant clinical challenge. Studying BMs can aid in improving early detection and monitoring. Systematic comparisons of anatomical distributions of BM from different primary cancers, however, remain largely unavailable. To test the hypothesis that anatomical BM distributions differ based on primary cancer type, we analyze the spatial coordinates of BMs for five different primary cancer types along principal component (PC) axes. The dataset includes 3949 intracranial metastases, labeled by primary cancer types and with six features. We employ PC coordinates to highlight the distinctions between various cancer types. We utilized different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (RF, SVM, TabNet DL) models to establish the relationship between primary cancer diagnosis, spatial coordinates of BMs, age, and target volume. Our findings revealed that PC1 aligns most with the Y axis, followed by the Z axis, and has minimal correlation with the X axis. Based on PC1 versus PC2 plots, we identified notable differences in anatomical spreading patterns between Breast and Lung cancer, as well as Breast and Renal cancer. In contrast, Renal and Lung cancer, as well as Lung and Melanoma, showed similar patterns. Our ML and DL results demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing BM distribution for different primary cancers, with the SVM algorithm achieving 97% accuracy using a polynomial kernel and TabNet achieving 96%. The RF algorithm ranked PC1 as the most important discriminating feature. In summary, our results support accurate multiclass ML classification regarding brain metastases distribution.",

    "title": "Towards A universal settling model for microplastics with diverse shapes: Machine learning breaking morphological barriers.",
    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the settling velocity of microplastics in aquatic environments is a prerequisite for reliably modeling their transport processes. An increasing number of settling models have been proposed for microplastics with fragmented, filmed, and fibrous morphologies, respectively. However, none of the existing models demonstrates universal applicability across all three morphologies. Scientists now have to rely on the predominate microplastic morphology extracted from filed samples to determine the appropriate settling model used for transport modeling. Given the spatiotemporal variability in morphologies and the coexistence of diverse morphologies of microplastics in natural aquatic environments, the extracted morphological information poses significant challenges in reliably determining the appropriate model. Evidently, to reliably model the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments, a universal settling model for microplastics with diverse shapes is warranted. To develop such a universal model, a unique shape factor, which can explicitly distinguish between the distinct morphologies of microplastics, was first proposed in this study by using a specifically-modified machine learning method. Using this newly-proposed shape factor, a universal model for predicting the settling velocity of microplastics with distinct morphologies was developed by using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm and then systematically evaluated against independent data sets. The newly-developed model enables reasonable predictions of the settling velocity of microplastic fragments, films, and fibers. In contrast to purely data-driven models, the newly-developed model is characterized by its transparent formulaic structure and physical interpretability, which is conducive to further expansion and improvement. This study can serve as a paradigm for future studies, inspiring the adoption of machine learning techniques in the development of physically-based models to investigate the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence was born to allow computers to learn and control their environment, trying to imitate the human brain structure by simulating its biological evolution. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to analyze large amounts of data (big data) in real-time, providing forecasts that can support the clinician's decisions. This scenario can include diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, and pain medicine. Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It is based on algorithms trained for decisions making that automatically learn and recognize patterns from data. This article aims to offer an overview of the potential application of AI in anesthesiology and analyzes the operating principles of machine learning Every Machine Learning pathway starts from task definition and ends in model application. High-performance characteristics and strict quality controls are needed during its progress. During this process, different measures can be identified (pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model processing and evaluation).

Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials.

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly enabled the study of genomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics. Automated annotation and classification of the vast amounts of generated sequence data has become paramount for facilitating biological sciences. Genomes of viruses can be radically different from all life, both in terms of molecular structure and primary sequence. Alignment-based and profile-based searches are commonly employed for characterization of assembled viral contigs from high-throughput sequencing data. Recent attempts have highlighted the use of machine learning models for the task, but these models rely entirely on DNA genomes and owing to the intrinsic genomic complexity of viruses, RNA viruses have gone completely overlooked. Here, we present a novel short k-mer based sequence scoring method that generates robust sequence information for training machine learning classifiers. We trained 18 classifiers for the task of distinguishing viral RNA from human transcripts. We challenged our models with very stringent testing protocols across different species and evaluated performance against BLASTn, BLASTx and HMMER3 searches. For clean sequence data retrieved from curated databases, our models display near perfect accuracy, outperforming all similar attempts previously reported. On de novo assemblies of raw RNA-Seq data from cells subjected to Ebola virus, the area under the ROC curve varied from 0.6 to 0.86 depending on the software used for assembly. Our classifier was able to properly classify the majority of the false hits generated by BLAST and HMMER3 searches on the same data. The outstanding performance metrics of our model lays the groundwork for robust machine learning methods for the automated annotation of sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel activity has long been associated with several diseases including epilepsy, chronic pain, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, immune system, neuromuscular and respiratory disorders. The strong participation of these channels in the development of diseases makes them excellent promising therapeutic targets. Voltage-gated Na channel blocking peptides come from a wide source of organisms such as venoms. However, the in vitro and in vivo identification and validation of these peptides are time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we developed a bioinformatics tool called PEP-PRED for the highly specific prediction of voltage-gated Na channel blocking peptides. PEP-PRED is based on the random forest algorithm, which presented excellent performance measures during the cross-validation (sensitivity = 0.81, accuracy = 0.83, precision = 0.85, F-score = 0.83, specificity = 0.86, and Matthew's correlation coefficient = 0.67) and testing (sensitivity = 0.88, accuracy = 0.92, precision = 0.96, F-score = 0.91, specificity = 0.96, and Matthew's correlation coefficient = 0.84) phases.

Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the body weight ratio measured by the developed SPMS to identify the method that most accurately classified the actual sitting posture of the seated person. After classifying the sitting postures using several classifiers, average and maximum classification rates of 97.20% and 97.94%, respectively, were obtained from nine subjects with a support vector machine using the radial basis function kernel; the results obtained by this classifier showed a statistically significant difference from the results of multiple classifications using other classifiers.

    "abstract": "Automatic facial coding (AFC) is a promising new research tool to efficiently analyze emotional facial expressions. AFC is based on machine learning procedures to infer emotion categorization from facial movements (i.e., Action Units). State-of-the-art AFC accurately classifies intense and prototypical facial expressions, whereas it is less accurate for non-prototypical and less intense facial expressions. A potential reason might be that AFC is typically trained with standardized and prototypical facial expression inventories. Because AFC would be useful to analyze less prototypical research material as well, we set out to determine the role of prototypicality in the training material. We trained established machine learning algorithms either with standardized expressions from widely used research inventories or with unstandardized emotional facial expressions obtained in a typical laboratory setting and tested them on identical or cross-over material. All machine learning models' accuracies were comparable when trained and tested with held-out dataset from the same dataset (acc. = [83.4% to 92.5%]). Strikingly, we found a substantial drop in accuracies for models trained with the highly prototypical standardized dataset when tested in the unstandardized dataset (acc. = [52.8%; 69.8%]). However, when they were trained with unstandardized expressions and tested with standardized datasets, accuracies held up (acc. = [82.7%; 92.5%]). These findings demonstrate a strong impact of the training material's prototypicality on AFC's ability to classify emotional faces. Because AFC would be useful for analyzing emotional facial expressions in research or even naturalistic scenarios, future developments should include more naturalistic facial expressions for training. This approach will improve the generalizability of AFC to encode more naturalistic facial expressions and increase robustness for future applications of this promising technology.",

    "title": "TrimNet: learning molecular representation from triplet messages for biomedicine.",
    "abstract": "Computational methods accelerate drug discovery and play an important role in biomedicine, such as molecular property prediction and compound-protein interaction (CPI) identification. A key challenge is to learn useful molecular representation. In the early years, molecular properties are mainly calculated by quantum mechanics or predicted by traditional machine learning methods, which requires expert knowledge and is often labor-intensive. Nowadays, graph neural networks have received significant attention because of the powerful ability to learn representation from graph data. Nevertheless, current graph-based methods have some limitations that need to be addressed, such as large-scale parameters and insufficient bond information extraction. In this study, we proposed a graph-based approach and employed a novel triplet message mechanism to learn molecular representation efficiently, named triplet message networks (TrimNet). We show that TrimNet can accurately complete multiple molecular representation learning tasks with significant parameter reduction, including the quantum properties, bioactivity, physiology and CPI prediction. In the experiments, TrimNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin on various datasets. Besides the few parameters and high prediction accuracy, TrimNet could focus on the atoms essential to the target properties, providing a clear interpretation of the prediction tasks. These advantages have established TrimNet as a powerful and useful computational tool in solving the challenging problem of molecular representation learning. The quantum and drug datasets are available on the website of MoleculeNet: http://moleculenet.ai.

    "title": "Revolutionizing drug formulation development: The increasing impact of machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques has rapidly expanded across many fields of research including formulation science. At the same time, the use of lipid nanoparticles to enable the successful delivery of mRNA vaccines in the recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the impact of formulation science. Yet, the design of advanced pharmaceutical formulations is non-trivial and primarily relies on costly and time-consuming wet-lab experimentation. In 2021, our group published a review article focused on the use of ML as a means to accelerate drug formulation development. Since then, the field has witnessed significant growth and progress, reflected by an increasing number of studies published in this area. This updated review summarizes the current state of ML directed drug formulation development, introduces advanced ML techniques that have been implemented in formulation design and shares the progress on making self-driving laboratories a reality. Furthermore, this review highlights several future applications of ML yet to be fully exploited to advance drug formulation research and development.",

    "title": "Cancer gene identification through integrating causal prompting large language model with omics data-driven causal inference.",
    "abstract": "Identifying genes causally linked to cancer from a multi-omics perspective is essential for understanding the mechanisms of cancer and improving therapeutic strategies. Traditional statistical and machine-learning methods that rely on generalized correlation approaches to identify cancer genes often produce redundant, biased predictions with limited interpretability, largely due to overlooking confounding factors, selection biases, and the nonlinear activation function in neural networks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for identifying cancer genes across multiple omics domains, named ICGI (Integrative Causal Gene Identification), which leverages a large language model (LLM) prompted with causality contextual cues and prompts, in conjunction with data-driven causal feature selection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of LLMs in uncovering cancer genes and comprehending disease mechanisms, particularly at the genomic level. However, our findings also highlight that current LLMs may not capture comprehensive information across all omics levels. By applying the proposed causal feature selection module to transcriptomic datasets from six cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas and comparing its performance with state-of-the-art methods, it demonstrates superior capability in identifying cancer genes that distinguish between cancerous and normal samples. Additionally, we have developed an online service platform that allows users to input a gene of interest and a specific cancer type. The platform provides automated results indicating whether the gene plays a significant role in cancer, along with clear and accessible explanations. Moreover, the platform summarizes the inference outcomes obtained from data-driven causal learning methods.",

    "title": "Using a stepwise approach to simultaneously develop and validate machine learning based prediction models.",
    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of a disease is essential in healthcare. Prediction models, based on classical regression techniques, are widely used in clinical practice. Machine Learning (ML) techniques might be preferred in case of a large amount of data per patient and relatively limited numbers of subjects. However, this increases the risk of overfitting, and external validation is imperative. However, in the field of ML, new and more efficient techniques are developed rapidly, and if recruiting patients for a validation study is time consuming, the ML technique used to develop the first model might have been surpassed by more efficient ML techniques, rendering this original model no longer relevant. We demonstrate a stepwise design for simultaneous development and validation of prediction models based on ML techniques. The design enables - in one study - evaluation of the stability and robustness of a prediction model over increasing sample size as well as assessment of the stability of sensitivity/specificity at a chosen cut-off. This will shorten the time to introduction of a new test in health care. We finally describe how to use regular clinical parameters in conjunction with ML based predictions, to further enhance differentiation between subjects with and without a disease.",

    "title": "CIPHER-SC: Disease-Gene Association Inference Using Graph Convolution on a Context-Aware Network With Single-Cell Data.",
    "abstract": "Inference of disease-gene associations helps unravel the pathogenesis of diseases and contributes to the treatment. Although many machine learning-based methods have been developed to predict causative genes, accurate association inference remains challenging. One major reason is the inaccurate feature selection and accumulation of error brought by commonly used multi-stage training architecture. In addition, the existing methods do not incorporate cell-type-specific information, thus fail to study gene functions at a higher resolution. Therefore, we introduce single-cell transcriptome data and construct a context-aware network to unbiasedly integrate all data sources. Then we develop a graph convolution-based approach named CIPHER-SC to realize a complete end-to-end learning architecture. Our approach outperforms four state-of-the-art approaches in five-fold cross-validations on three distinct test sets with the best AUC of 0.9501, demonstrating its stable ability either to predict the novel genes or to predict with genetic basis. The ablation study shows that our complete end-to-end design and unbiased data integration boost the performance from 0.8727 to 0.9443 in AUC. The addition of single-cell data further improves the prediction accuracy and makes our results be enriched for cell-type-specific genes. These results confirm the ability of CIPHER-SC to discover reliable disease genes. Our implementation is available at http://github.com/YidingZhang117/CIPHER-SC.",

    "title": "A comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms and their application in geriatric medicine: present and future.",
    "abstract": "The increasing access to health data worldwide is driving a resurgence in machine learning research, including data-hungry deep learning algorithms. More computationally efficient algorithms now offer unique opportunities to enhance diagnosis, risk stratification, and individualised approaches to patient management. Such opportunities are particularly relevant for the management of older patients, a group that is characterised by complex multimorbidity patterns and significant interindividual variability in homeostatic capacity, organ function, and response to treatment. Clinical tools that utilise machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal choice of treatment are slowly gaining the necessary approval from governing bodies and being implemented into healthcare, with significant implications for virtually all medical disciplines during the next phase of digital medicine. Beyond obtaining regulatory approval, a crucial element in implementing these tools is the trust and support of the people that use them. In this context, an increased understanding by clinicians of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provides an appreciation of the possible benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and improves the chances for successful adoption. This review provides a broad taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, followed by a more detailed description of each algorithm class, their purpose and capabilities, and examples of their applications, particularly in geriatric medicine. Additional focus is given on the clinical implications and challenges involved in relying on devices with reduced interpretability and the progress made in counteracting the latter via the development of explainable machine learning.",

Furthermore, the processing and analysis of quickly expanding massive data necessitate the use of cutting-edge methodologies. As a result, Artificial Intelligence-driven methods that have been shown to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug discovery have grown in favor. The goal of this thorough analysis is to provide an overview of the drug discovery and development timeline, various approaches to drug design, and the use of Artificial Intelligence in many aspects of drug discovery. Traditional drug development approaches and their disadvantages have been explored in this paper, followed by an introduction to AI-based technology. Also, advanced methods used in Machine Learning and Deep Learning are examined in detail. A few examples of big data research that has transformed the field of medication discovery have also been presented. Also covered are the many databases, toolkits, and software available for constructing Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning models, as well as some standard model evaluation parameters. Finally, recent advances and uses of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in drug discovery are thoroughly examined, along with their limitations and future potential. Artificial Intelligence-based technologies enhance decision-making by utilizing the abundantly available high-quality data, thereby reducing the time and cost involved in the process.

    "abstract": "Organic photovoltaic devices are promising candidates for efficient energy harvesting from sunlight. Designing new dye molecules suitable for such devices is a challenging task restricted by the rapid increase of computational cost with system size. Solar cell material properties are closely related to the electronic structure of the dye, and an effective molecular orbital energy screening method for a family of dyes is therefore desired. In this work, a machine learning approach is used to sort through the chemical space of peripheral double-substituted boron-Subphthalocyanine dyes. A database of 12,102 PM6 optimized structures was built and for each of the structures time-dependent density functional theory (LC-[Formula: see text]HPBE/6-31+G(d)) calculations were performed. We investigated the changes of the molecular orbital energies of the molecular orbitals related to reduction and oxidation of the compounds. With the Electrotopological-state index moleculear representation all the tested algorithms, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Regression, Neural Network, and Simple Linear Regression, captured the calculated frontier orbital energies with a prediction root-mean-square-error in the order of 0.05 eV. Finally, frontier orbital energies were predicted for more than 40,000 new structures by the trained Support Vector Machine algorithm. Compared to the parent boron-Subphthalocyanine structure, 237 and 132 functionalized dyes were predicted to have upshifted molecular orbital energies using the Electrotopological-state index and OneHot encoding feature vector, respectively. Out of 27 investigated donor and acceptor ligands, the acetamide and hydroxyl ligands gave rise to the desired increase in frontier molecular orbital energy.",

Here, we study classification of atomic force microscope-based DFS measurements using machine-learning algorithms in order to automate selection of successful force curves. Notably, we collect a data set that has a testable positive signal using photoswitch-modified DNA before and after illumination with UV (365 nm) light. We generate a feature set consisting of six properties of force-distance curves to train supervised models and use principal component analysis (PCA) for an unsupervised model. For supervised classification, we train random forest models for binary and multiclass classification of force-distance curves. Random forest models predict successful pulls with an accuracy of 94% and classify them into five classes with an accuracy of 90%. The unsupervised method using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) reaches an accuracy of approximately 80% for binary classification.",

    "title": "Multiple remotely sensed datasets and machine learning models to predict chlorophyll-a concentration in the Nakdong River, South Korea.",
    "abstract": "The Nakdong River is a crucial water resource in South Korea, supplying water for various purposes such as potable water, irrigation, and recreation. However, the river is vulnerable to algal blooms due to the inflow of pollutants from multiple points and non-point sources. Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, a proxy for algal biomass is essential for assessing the trophic status of the river and managing its ecological health. This study aimed to improve the accuracy and reliability of Chl-a estimation in the Nakdong River using machine learning models (MLMs) and simultaneous use of multiple remotely sensed datasets. This study compared the performances of four MLMs: multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and eXetreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) using three different input datasets: (1) two remotely sensed datasets (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8), (2) standalone Sentinel-2, and (3) standalone Landsat-8. The results showed that the MLP model with multiple remotely sensed datasets outperformed other MLMs with 0.43 - 0.86 greater in R and 0.36 - 5.88 lower in RMSE. The MLP model demonstrated the highest performance across the range of Chl-a concentrations and predicted peaks above 20 mg/m relatively well compared to other models. This was likely due to the capacity of MLP to handle imbalanced datasets. The predictive map of the spatial distribution of Chl-a generated by MLP well captured the areas with high and low Chl-a concentrations. This study pointed out the impacts of imbalanced Chl-a concentration observations (dominated by low Chl-a concentrations) on the performance of MLMs. The data imbalance likely led to MLMs poorly trained for high Chl-a values, producing low prediction accuracy. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the value of multiple remotely sensed datasets in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of Chl-a estimation, mainly when using the MLP model. These findings would provide valuable insights into utilizing MLMs effectively for Chl-a monitoring.",

    "title": "Childhood Leukemia Classification via Information Bottleneck Enhanced Hierarchical Multi-Instance Learning.",
    "abstract": "Leukemia classification relies on a detailed cytomorphological examination of Bone Marrow (BM) smear. However, applying existing deep-learning methods to it is facing two significant limitations. Firstly, these methods require large-scale datasets with expert annotations at the cell level for good results and typically suffer from poor generalization. Secondly, they simply treat the BM cytomorphological examination as a multi-class cell classification task, thus failing to exploit the correlation among leukemia subtypes over different hierarchies. Therefore, BM cytomorphological estimation as a time-consuming and repetitive process still needs to be done manually by experienced cytologists. Recently, Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has achieved much progress in data-efficient medical image processing, which only requires patient-level labels (which can be extracted from the clinical reports). In this paper, we propose a hierarchical MIL framework and equip it with Information Bottleneck (IB) to tackle the above limitations. First, to handle the patient-level label, our hierarchical MIL framework uses attention-based learning to identify cells with high diagnostic values for leukemia classification in different hierarchies. Then, following the information bottleneck principle, we propose a hierarchical IB to constrain and refine the representations of different hierarchies for better accuracy and generalization. By applying our framework to a large-scale childhood acute leukemia dataset with corresponding BM smear images and clinical reports, we show that it can identify diagnostic-related cells without the need for cell-level annotations and outperforms other comparison methods. Furthermore, the evaluation conducted on an independent test cohort demonstrates the high generalizability of our framework.",

Analyzing these data, discovering metastable states, and uncovering their nature are becoming increasingly challenging. In this paper, we first use the variational approach to conformation dynamics to discover the slowest dynamical modes of the simulations. This allows the different metastable states of the system to be located and organized hierarchically. The physical descriptors that characterize metastable states are discovered by means of a machine learning method. We show in the cases of two proteins, chignolin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, how such analysis can be effortlessly performed in a matter of seconds.

This approach is based on the fact that if a wild-type protein is more stable than a mutant protein, then the same mutant is less stable than the wild-type protein. We analyzed the underlying issues and suggest that the main causes of the overfitting problem include that the numbers of training cases were too small, and the features used in the models were not sufficiently informative for the task. We make recommendations on how to avoid overfitting in this important research area and improve the reliability and robustness of ML-based algorithms in general.",

This so-called embedded atom neural network (EANN) approach is inspired by the well-known empirical embedded atom method (EAM) model used in the condensed phase. It simply replaces the scalar embedded atom density in EAM with a Gaussian-type orbital based density vector and represents the complex relationship between the embedded density vector and atomic energy by neural networks. We demonstrate that the EANN approach is equally accurate as several established ML models in representing both big molecular and extended periodic systems, yet with much fewer parameters and configurations. It is highly efficient as it implicitly contains the three-body information without an explicit sum of the conventional costly angular descriptors. With high accuracy and efficiency, EANN potentials can vastly accelerate molecular dynamics and spectroscopic simulations in complex systems at ab initio level.",

This study evaluates the potential of an automated machine learning approach to develop surrogate models based on conventional process simulation models. The analysis focuses on several high-value biofuels and bioproducts for which pathways of production from biomass feedstocks have been well-established.

And significant advances have been made in many toxicity endpoints, such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and hepatotoxicity.

    "title": "Efficient Violence Detection in Surveillance.",
    "abstract": "Intelligent video surveillance systems are rapidly being introduced to public places. The adoption of computer vision and machine learning techniques enables various applications for collected video features; one of the major is safety monitoring. The efficacy of violent event detection is measured by the efficiency and accuracy of violent event detection. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for violence detection from video surveillance cameras. Our proposed model is a spatial feature extracting a U-Net-like network that uses MobileNet V2 as an encoder followed by LSTM for temporal feature extraction and classification. The proposed model is computationally light and still achieves good results-experiments showed that an average accuracy is 0.82 ± 2% and average precision is 0.81 ± 3% using a complex real-world security camera footage dataset based on RWF-2000.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the machine learning research community has benefited tremendously from the availability of openly accessible benchmark datasets. Clinical data are usually not openly available due to their confidential nature. This has hampered the development of reproducible and generalisable machine learning applications in health care. Here we introduce the Health Gym - a growing collection of highly realistic synthetic medical datasets that can be freely accessed to prototype, evaluate, and compare machine learning algorithms, with a specific focus on reinforcement learning. The three synthetic datasets described in this paper present patient cohorts with acute hypotension and sepsis in the intensive care unit, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy. The datasets were created using a novel generative adversarial network (GAN). The distributions of variables, and correlations between variables and trends in variables over time in the synthetic datasets mirror those in the real datasets. Furthermore, the risk of sensitive information disclosure associated with the public distribution of the synthetic datasets is estimated to be very low.",

    "title": "Deep Federated Adaptation: An Adaptative Residential Load Forecasting Approach with Federated Learning.",
    "abstract": "Residential-level short-term load forecasting (STLF) is significant for power system operation. Data-driven forecasting models, especially machine-learning-based models, are sensitive to the amount of data. However, privacy and security concerns raised by supervision departments and users limit the data for sharing. Meanwhile, the limited data from the newly built houses are not sufficient to support building a powerful model. Another problem is that the data from different houses are in a non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID), which makes the general model fail in predicting accurate load for the specific house. Even though we can build a model corresponding to each house, it costs a large computation time. We first propose a federated transfer learning approach applied in STLF, deep federated adaptation (DFA), to deal with the aforementioned problems. This approach adopts the federated learning architecture to train a global model without undermining privacy, and then the model leverage multiple kernel variant of maximum mean discrepancies (MK-MMD) to fine-tune the global model, which makes the model adapted to the specific house's prediction task. Experimental results on the real residential datasets show that DFA has the best forecasting performance compared with other baseline models and the federated architecture of DFA has a remarkable superiority in computation time. The framework of DFA is extended with alternative transfer learning methods and all of them achieve good performances on STLF.",

CA has found applications in fields ranging from epidemiology to social sciences. However, current methods for CA do not scale to large, high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we provide a novel interpretation of CA in terms of an information-theoretic quantity called the principal inertia components. We show that estimating the principal inertia components, which consists in solving a functional optimization problem over the space of finite variance functions of two random variable, is equivalent to performing CA. We then leverage this insight to design algorithms to perform CA at scale. Specifically, we demonstrate how the principal inertia components can be reliably approximated from data using deep neural networks. Finally, we show how the maximally correlated embeddings of pairs of random variables in CA further play a central role in several learning problems including multi-view and multi-modal learning methods and visualization of classification boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of nested functions (i.e., functions of functions) is one of the central reasons for the success and popularity of machine learning. Today, artificial neural networks are the predominant class of algorithms in this area, known as representational learning. Here, we introduce Representational Gradient Boosting (RGB), a nonparametric algorithm that estimates functions with multi-layer architectures obtained using backpropagation in the space of functions. RGB does not need to assume a functional form in the nodes or output (e.g., linear models or rectified linear units), but rather estimates these transformations. RGB can be seen as an optimized stacking procedure where a meta algorithm learns how to combine different classes of functions (e.g., Neural Networks (NN) and Gradient Boosting (GB)), while building and optimizing them jointly in an attempt to compensate each other's weaknesses. This highlights a stark difference with current approaches to meta-learning that combine models only after they have been built independently. We showed that providing optimized stacking is one of the main advantages of RGB over current approaches. Additionally, due to the nested nature of RGB we also showed how it improves over GB in problems that have several high-order interactions. Finally, we investigate both theoretically and in practice the problem of recovering nested functions and the value of prior knowledge.",

This concept of clinical entropy removal has significant potential for further use to bring forth healthcare innovation, such as quantifying the impact of clinical guidelines and value of care and applications to Emergency Medicine scenarios where diagnostic accuracy in a limited time window is paramount. This analysis was done for 623 diagnostic tools and provided unique insights into their utility.

    "title": "Automatic recognition of specific local cortical folding patterns.",
    "abstract": "The study of local cortical folding patterns showed links with psychiatric illnesses as well as cognitive functions. Despite the tools now available to visualize cortical folds in 3D, manually classifying local sulcal patterns is a time-consuming and tedious task. In fact, 3D visualization of folds helps experts to identify different sulcal patterns but fold variability is so high that the distinction between these patterns sometimes requires the definition of complex criteria, making manual classification difficult and not reliable. However, the assessment of the impact of these patterns on the functional organization of the cortex could benefit from the study of large databases, especially when studying rare patterns. In this paper, several algorithms for the automatic classification of fold patterns are proposed to allow morphological studies to be extended and confirmed on such large databases. Three methods are proposed, the first based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the second on the Scoring by Non-local Image Patch Estimator (SNIPE) approach and the third based on a 3D Convolution Neural Network (CNN). These methods are generic enough to be applicable to a wide range of folding patterns. They are tested on two types of patterns for which there is currently no method to automatically identify them: the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) patterns and the Power Button Sign (PBS). The two ACC patterns are almost equally present whereas PBS is a particularly rare pattern in the general population. The three models proposed achieve balanced accuracies of approximately 80% for ACC patterns classification and 60% for PBS classification. The CNN-based model is more interesting for the classification of ACC patterns thanks to its rapid execution. However, SVM and SNIPE-based models are more effective in managing unbalanced problems such as PBS recognition.",

We use a machine-learning approach to detect and predict anxiety scores in organizational crisis announcements on social media and the public's responses to these posts. We also control for emotional and language tones in organizational crisis responses using a separate machine learning algorithm. Perceived organizational anxiety positively influences public anxiety, confirming the occurrence of emotional contagion from the organization to the public. Crisis response strategies moderated this relationship, so that responsibility acknowledgment lowered public anxiety the most. We argue that by accounting for emotions expressed in organizational crisis responses, organizations may be able to better predict and manage public emotions.",

    "abstract": "To assess the feasibility of code-free deep learning (CFDL) platforms in the prediction of binary outcomes from fundus images in ophthalmology, evaluating two distinct online-based platforms (Google Vertex and Amazon Rekognition), and two distinct datasets. Two publicly available datasets, Messidor-2 and BRSET, were utilized for model development. The Messidor-2 consists of fundus photographs from diabetic patients and the BRSET is a multi-label dataset. The CFDL platforms were used to create deep learning models, with no preprocessing of the images, by a single ophthalmologist without coding expertise. The performance metrics employed to evaluate the models were F1 score, area under curve (AUC), precision and recall. The performance metrics for referable diabetic retinopathy and macular edema were above 0.9 for both tasks and CDFL. The Google Vertex models demonstrated superior performance compared to the Amazon models, with the BRSET dataset achieving the highest accuracy (AUC of 0.994). Multi-classification tasks using only BRSET achieved similar overall performance between platforms, achieving AUC of 0.994 for laterality, 0.942 for age grouping, 0.779 for genetic sex identification, 0.857 for optic, and 0.837 for normality with Google Vertex. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using automated machine learning platforms for predicting binary outcomes from fundus images in ophthalmology. It highlights the high accuracy achieved by the models in some tasks and the potential of CFDL as an entry-friendly platform for ophthalmologists to familiarize themselves with machine learning concepts.",

    "abstract": "Innovative computer techniques are starting to be employed not only in academic research, but also in commercial production, finding use in many areas of dentistry. This is conducive to the digitalization of dentistry and its increasing treatment and diagnostic demands. In many areas of dentistry, such as orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery, but also periodontics or prosthetics, only a correct diagnosis ensures the correct treatment plan, which is the only way to restore the patient's health. The diagnosis and treatment plan is based on the specialist's knowledge, but is subject to a large, multi-factorial risk of error. Therefore, the introduction of multiparametric pattern recognition methods (statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)) is a great hope for both the physicians and the patients. However, the general use of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in a dental clinic is not yet realistic and requires work in many aspects - methodical, technological and business. The article presents a review of the latest attempts to apply AI, such as CDSS or genetic algorithms (GAs) in research and clinical dentistry, taking under consideration all of the main dental specialties. Work on the introduction of public CDSS has been continued for years. The article presents the latest achievements in this field, analyzing their real-life application and credibility.",

    "abstract": "Identifying bacterial strains is essential in microbiology for various practical applications, such as disease diagnosis and quality monitoring of food and water. Classical machine learning algorithms have been utilized to identify bacteria based on their Raman spectra. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer higher classification accuracy, but they require extensive training sets and retraining of previous untrained class targets can be costly and time-consuming. Siamese networks have emerged as a promising solution. They are composed of two CNNs with the same structure and a final network that acts as a distance metric, converting the classification problem into a similarity problem. Classical machine learning approaches, shallow and deep CNNs, and two Siamese network variants were tailored and tested on Raman spectral datasets of bacteria. The methods were evaluated based on mean sensitivity, training time, prediction time, and the number of parameters. In this comparison, Siamese-model2 achieved the highest mean sensitivity of 83.61 ± 4.73 and demonstrated remarkable performance in handling unbalanced and limited data scenarios, achieving a prediction accuracy of 73%. Therefore, the choice of model depends on the specific trade-off between accuracy, (prediction/training) time, and resources for the particular application. Classical machine learning models and shallow CNN models may be more suitable if time and computational resources are a concern. Siamese networks are a good choice for small datasets and CNN for extensive data.",

About 1 in 8 US women (about 13%) will develop invasive BC throughout their lifetime. Early detection of this life-threatening disease not only increases the survival rate but also reduces the treatment cost. Fortunately, advancements in radiographic imaging like \"Mammograms\", \"Computed Tomography (CT)\", \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"3D Mammography\", and \"Histopathological Imaging (HI)\" have made it feasible to diagnose this life-taking disease at an early stage. However, the analysis of radiographic images and Histopathological images is done by experienced radiologists and pathologists, respectively. The process is not only costly but also error-prone. Over the last ten years, Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed the world in every way possible. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of ML has shown outstanding results in a variety of fields, particularly in the biomedical industry, because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. DL techniques automatically extract the features by analyzing the high dimensional and correlated data efficiently. The potential and ability of DL models have also been utilized and evaluated in the identification and prognosis of BC, utilizing radiographic and Histopathological images, and have performed admirably. However, AI has shown good claims in retrospective studies only. External validations are needed for translating these cutting-edge AI tools as a clinical decision maker. The main aim of this research work is to present the critical analysis of the research and findings already done to detect and classify BC using various imaging modalities including \"Mammography\", \"Histopathology\", \"Ultrasound\", \"PET/CT\", \"MRI\", and \"Thermography\". At first, a detailed review of the past research papers using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for BC classification and detection is carried out. We also review the publicly available datasets for the above-mentioned imaging modalities to make future research more accessible. Finally, a critical discussion section has been included to elaborate open research difficulties and prospects for future study in this emerging area, demonstrating the limitations of Deep Learning approaches.",

High-fidelity acquisition and analysis of plant electrophysiological signals contribute to early stress identification, thereby enhancing agricultural production efficiency. While traditional plant electrophysiology monitoring methods like gel electrodes can capture electrical signals on plant surfaces, which face limitations due to the plant cuticle barrier, impacting signal accuracy. Moreover, the vast and intricate nature of plant electrical signal data, coupled with the absence of specialized large-scale models, impedes signal interpretation and plant physiological correlation. In light of these challenges, we engineered an implantable microneedle array using micromachining technology for monitoring and decoding plant electrical signals in a minimally invasive manner. This innovative sensor can securely adhere to plant tissue over extended periods, enabling the precise recording of electrical signals triggered by transient (mechanical injury) and long-term stresses (drought and salt stress). Based on the collected plant electrophysiological data, we utilized a machine learning model to analyze these signals for the early detection of plant stress with an accuracy of 99.29%.

    "abstract": "Phage virion protein (PVP) perforate the host cell membrane and eventually culminates in cell rupture thereby releasing replicated phages. The accurate identification of PVP is thus a crucial step towards improving our understanding of the biological function and mechanisms of PVPs. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a computational method that is capable of fast and accurate identification of PVPs. To address this, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor employing probabilistic information (referred herein as the Meta-iPVP) for the accurate identification of PVPs. Particularly, efficient feature representation approach was used to generate discriminative probabilistic features from four machine learning (ML) algorithms making use of seven feature encodings. To the best of our knowledge, the Meta-iPVP is the first meta-based approach that has been developed for PVP prediction. Independent test results indicated that the Meta-iPVP could discern important characteristics between PVPs and non-PVPs as well as achieving the best accuracy and MCC of 0.817 and 0.642, respectively, which corresponds to 6-10% and 14-21% improvements over existing PVP predictors. As such, this demonstrates that the proposed Meta-iPVP is a more efficient, robust and promising for the identification of PVPs. The predictive model is deployed as a publicly accessible Meta-iPVP webserver freely available online at http://camt.pythonanywhere.com/Meta-iPVP .",

    "title": "Accelerating Molecular Docking using Machine Learning Methods.",
    "abstract": "Virtual screening (VS) is one of the well-established approaches in drug discovery which speeds up the search for a bioactive molecule and, reduces costs and efforts associated with experiments. VS helps to narrow down the search space of chemical space and allows selecting fewer and more probable candidate compounds for experimental testing. Docking calculations are one of the commonly used and highly appreciated structure-based drug discovery methods. Databases for chemical structures of small molecules have been growing rapidly. However, at the moment virtual screening of large libraries via docking is not very common. In this work, we aim to accelerate docking studies by predicting docking scores without explicitly performing docking calculations. We experimented with an attention based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for an efficient prediction of docking scores as well as other machine learning models such as XGBoost. By using docking scores of a small number of ligands we trained our models and predicted docking scores of a few million molecules. Specifically, we tested our approaches on 11 datasets that were produced from in-house drug discovery studies. On average, by training models using only 7000 molecules we predicted docking scores of approximately 3.8 million molecules with R (coefficient of determination) of 0.77 and Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.85. We designed the system with ease of use in mind. All the user needs to provide is a csv file containing SMILES and their respective docking scores, the system then outputs a model that the user can use for the prediction of docking score for a new molecule.",

The analyses were carried out for separation of drug from a solution by adsorption process where the concentration of drug was obtained in the solution and the adsorbent via computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the results of concentration distribution were used or machine learning modeling. The model considered mass transfer and fluid flow equations to determine concentration distribution of solute in the system. The hyperparameter optimization was carried out using the Fruit-Fly Optimization Algorithm (FFOA), a nature-inspired optimization technique. Our results demonstrate the performance of each model in terms of key regression metrics.

    "title": "Adaptive self-supervised learning for sequential recommendation.",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation typically utilizes deep neural networks to mine rich information in interaction sequences. However, existing methods often face the issue of insufficient interaction data. To alleviate the sparsity issue, self-supervised learning is introduced into sequential recommendation. Despite its effectiveness, we argue that current self-supervised learning-based (i.e., SSL-based) sequential recommendation models have the following limitations: (1) using only a single self-supervised learning method, either contrastive self-supervised learning or generative self-supervised learning. (2) employing a simple data augmentation strategy in either the graph structure domain or the node feature domain. We believe that they have not fully utilized the capabilities of both self-supervised methods and have not sufficiently explored the advantages of combining graph augmentation schemes. As a result, they often fail to learn better item representations. In light of this, we propose a novel multi-task sequential recommendation framework named Adaptive Self-supervised Learning for sequential Recommendation (ASLRec). Specifically, our framework combines contrastive and generative self-supervised learning methods adaptively, simultaneously applying different perturbations at both the graph topology and node feature levels. This approach constructs diverse augmented graph views and employs multiple loss functions (including contrastive loss, generative loss, mask loss, and prediction loss) for joint training. By encompassing the capabilities of various methods, our model learns item representations across different augmented graph views to achieve better performance and effectively mitigate interaction noise and sparsity. In addition, we add a small proportion of random uniform noise to item representations, making the item representations more uniform and mitigating the inherent popularity bias in interaction records. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets to evaluate our model. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 14 other competitive methods: the hit rate (HR) improved by over 14.39%, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) increased by over 18.67%.",

Logistic regression, Random forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and other machine learning models were constructed to predict the mortality probability. Five measurements including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC) were acquired for model evaluation. An external validation was implemented to avoid conclusion bias. Results LightGBM outperformed other methods, achieving the highest AUC (0.900), accuracy (0.808), and precision (0.559). All machine learning models performed better than SAPS II score (AUC=0.748).

In Yemen, acute comorbidities further complicate the differentiation between COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. We explored the use of AI-powered predictive models and classifiers to enhance healthcare preparedness by forecasting respiratory disease trends using COVID-19 data. We developed mathematical models based on autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), ARMA, and machine and deep learning algorithms to predict daily confirmed deaths. Statistical models were trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%, with predicted results compared to actual values. The ARMA model demonstrated promising performance. Additionally, eight machine learning (ML) classifiers and deep learning (DL) models were utilized to identify COVID-19 severity indicators. Among the ML classifiers, the Decision Tree (DT) achieved the highest accuracy at 74.70%, followed closely by Random Forest (RF) at 74.66%. DL models showed comparable accuracy scores, around 70%. In terms of AUC-ROC, the kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed others, achieving 71% accuracy, with precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the curve values of 0.7, 0.75, 0.59, and 0.72, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven health analysis to optimize resource allocation and enhance forecasting for respiratory diseases.",

    "abstract": "A multi-method, multi-informant approach is crucial for evaluating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in preschool children due to the diagnostic complexities and challenges at this developmental stage. However, most artificial intelligence (AI) studies on the automated detection of ADHD have relied on using a single datatype. This study aims to develop a reliable multimodal AI-detection system to facilitate the diagnosis of ADHD in young children. 78 young children were recruited, including 43 diagnosed with ADHD (mean age: 68.07 ± 6.19 months) and 35 with typical development (mean age: 67.40 ± 5.44 months). Machine learning and deep learning methods were adopted to develop three individual predictive models using electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded with a wearable wireless device, scores from the computerized attention assessment via Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test Second Edition (K-CPT-2), and ratings from ADHD-related symptom scales. Finally, these models were combined to form a single ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 0.974. While individual modality provided the optimal classification with an accuracy rate of 0.909, 0.922, and 0.950 using the ADHD-related symptom rating scale, the K-CPT-2 score, and the EEG measure, respectively. Moreover, the findings suggest that teacher ratings, K-CPT-2 reaction time, and occipital high-frequency EEG band power values are significant features in identifying young children with ADHD. This study addresses three common issues in ADHD-related AI research: the utility of wearable technologies, integrating databases from diverse ADHD diagnostic instruments, and appropriately interpreting the models. This established multimodal system is potentially reliable and practical for distinguishing ADHD from TD, thus further facilitating the clinical diagnosis of ADHD in preschool young children.",

The models' inability to differentiate between noise and subtle, yet significant variation in data leads to their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations that cause wrong predictions with high confidence. The study is aimed at identifying whether the algorithms inspired by biological evolution may achieve better results in cases where brittle robustness properties are highly sensitive to the slight noise. To answer this question, we introduce the new robust gradient descent inspired by the stability and adaptability of biological systems to unknown and changing environments. The proposed optimization technique involves an open-ended adaptation process with regard to two hyperparameters inherited from the generalized Verhulst population growth equation. The hyperparameters increase robustness to adversarial noise by penalizing the degree to which hardly visible changes in gradients impact prediction. The empirical evidence on synthetic and experimental datasets confirmed the viability of the bio-inspired gradient descent and suggested promising directions for future research.

Taking the county-level administrative districts in China as the sample, this study uses machine learning models to fit the relationship between socioeconomic development (SED) and net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, it identifies key influencing factors and their effects based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The results show that the districts with low terrestrial NPP show the characteristics of agglomeration distribution. The eight key factors, in order, are as follows: agricultural development level, latitude, population size, longitude, animal husbandry development level, economic scale, time trend and industrialization level. In this study, via SHAP interaction plots, we found that the effects of population, economic growth, and industrialization on terrestrial NPP are regionally heterogeneous; via cluster analysis, we found the stage characteristics of the mode of SED affecting terrestrial NPP. Therefore, the conservation of terrestrial NPP needs to be combined with the stage changes of SED, as well as inter-regional differences, to develop a regionally coordinated and time-coherent ecological carbon sink conservation plan.",

Yet, the effectiveness of machine learning tools for retrosynthesis planning and forward reaction prediction relies on accessible, well-curated data presented in a structured format. Although some public and licensed reaction databases exist, they often lack essential information about reaction conditions. To address this issue and promote the principles of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data reporting and sharing, we introduce the Simple User-Friendly Reaction Format (SURF). SURF standardizes the documentation of reaction data through a structured tabular format, requiring only a basic understanding of spreadsheets. This format enables chemists to record the synthesis of molecules in a format that is understandable by both humans and machines, which facilitates seamless sharing and integration directly into machine learning pipelines. SURF files are designed to be interoperable, easily imported into relational databases, and convertible into other formats. This complements existing initiatives like the Open Reaction Database (ORD) and Unified Data Model (UDM). At Roche, SURF plays a crucial role in democratizing FAIR reaction data sharing and expediting the chemical synthesis process.",

In this paper, we used sensor data from 42 Afridev-brand handpumps observed for 14 months in western Kenya to demonstrate how sensors and supervised ensemble machine learning could be used to increase total fleet uptime from a best-practices baseline of about 70% to >99%. We accomplish this increase in uptime by forecasting pump failures and identifying existing failures very quickly. Comparing the costs of operating the pump per functional year over a lifetime of 10 years, we estimate that implementing this algorithm would save 7% on the levelized cost of water relative to a sensor-less scheduled maintenance program. Combined with a rigorous system for dispatching maintenance personnel, implementing this algorithm in a real-world program could significantly improve health outcomes and customers' willingness to pay for water services.",

Input signal values were sampled from noisy signals, and the target signal values were selected from corresponding denoised signals. A standard linear prediction model (Linear), two state-of-the-art models in general univariate signal prediction (Dlinear, Xgboost), and three deep learning models (Lstm, Trans-Enc, Trans-TSF) were chosen. The prediction performance was evaluated for three different prediction horizons (480, 680, and 920 ms). Moreover, the robustness of the different models when applied to atypical, that is, out-of-distribution (OOD) signals, was analyzed. The Lstm model achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error for all prediction horizons. The prediction errors only slightly increased for longer horizons. However, a substantial spread of the error values across the test signals was observed. Compared to typical, that is, in-distribution test signals, the prediction accuracy of all models decreased when applied to OOD signals. The more complex deep learning models Lstm and Trans-Enc showed the least performance loss, while the performance of simpler models like Linear dropped the most. Except for Trans-Enc, inference times for the different models allowed for real-time application. The application of the Lstm model achieved the lowest prediction errors. Simpler prediction filters suffer from limited signal history access, resulting in a drop in performance for OOD signals.",

    "title": "CISepsis: a causal inference framework for early sepsis detection.",
    "abstract": "The early prediction of sepsis based on machine learning or deep learning has achieved good results.Most of the methods use structured data stored in electronic medical records, but the pathological characteristics of sepsis involve complex interactions between multiple physiological systems and signaling pathways, resulting in mixed structured data. Some researchers will introduce unstructured data when also introduce confounders. These confounders mask the direct causality of sepsis, leading the model to learn misleading correlations. Finally, it affects the generalization ability, robustness, and interpretability of the model. To address this challenge, we propose an early sepsis prediction approach based on causal inference which can remove confounding effects and capture causal relationships. First, we analyze the relationship between each type of observation, confounder, and label to create a causal structure diagram. To eliminate the effects of different confounders separately, the methods of back-door adjustment and instrumental variable are used. Specifically, we learn the confounder and an instrumental variable based on mutual information from various observed data and eliminate the influence of the confounder by optimizing mutual information. We use back-door adjustment to eliminate the influence of confounders in clinical notes and static indicators on the true causal effect. Our method, named CISepsis, was validated on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Compared to existing state-of-the-art early sepsis prediction models such as XGBoost, LSTM, and MGP-AttTCN, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in AUC. Specifically, our model achieved AUC values of 0.921, 0.920, 0.919, 0.923, 0.924, 0.926, and 0.926 at the 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 time points, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method was confirmed through ablation experiments. Our method, based on causal inference, effectively removes the influence of confounding factors, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of the model. Compared to traditional methods, this adjustment allows for a more accurate capture of the true causal effects of sepsis, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Future research will explore the impact of specific indicators or treatment interventions on sepsis using counterfactual adjustments in causal inference, as well as investigate the potential clinical application of our method.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models were applied to pharmacovigilance (PV) data in a two-component proof-of-concept study. PV data were partitioned into Training, Validation, and Holdout datasets for model training and selection. During the first component ML models were challenged to identify factors in individual case safety reports (ICSRs) involving spinosad and neurological and ocular clinical signs. The target feature for the models were these clinical signs that were disproportionately reported for spinosad. The endpoints were normalized coefficient values representing the relationship between the target feature and ICSR free text fields. The deployed model accurately identified the risk factors \"demodectic,\" \"demodicosis,\" and \"ivomec.\" In the second component, the ML models were trained to identify high quality and complete ICSRs free of confounders. The deployed model was presented with an external Test dataset of six ICSRs, one that was complete, of high quality, and devoid of confounders, and five that were not. The endpoints were model-generated probabilities for the ICSRs. The deployed ML model accurately identified the ICSR of interest with a greater than 10-fold higher probability score. Although narrow in scope, the study supports further investigation and potential application of ML models to animal health PV data.",

Unfortunately, the detection of slow port scans in company networks is challenging due to the massive amount of network data. This paper proposes an innovative approach for preprocessing flow-based data which is specifically tailored to the detection of slow port scans. The preprocessing chain generates new objects based on flow-based data aggregated over time windows while taking domain knowledge as well as additional knowledge about the network structure into account. The computed objects are used as input for the further analysis. Based on these objects, we propose two different approaches for detection of slow port scans. One approach is unsupervised and uses sequential hypothesis testing whereas the other approach is supervised and uses classification algorithms. We compare both approaches with existing port scan detection algorithms on the flow-based CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that the proposed approaches achieve better detection rates and exhibit less false alarms than similar algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is well underway, including in the medical field, and has dramatically transformed our lives. An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.",

Social networks, where nodes represent hosts and edges represent direct or indirect contacts between them, are important in quantifying these aspects of infectious disease dynamics. However, how network structure and epidemic parameters interact in empirical networks to promote or protect animal populations from infectious disease remains a challenge. Here we draw on advances in spectral graph theory and machine learning to build predictive models of pathogen spread on a large collection of empirical networks from across the animal kingdom. We show that the spectral features of an animal network are powerful predictors of pathogen spread for a variety of hosts and pathogens and can be a valuable proxy for the vulnerability of animal networks to pathogen spread. We validate our findings using interpretable machine learning techniques and provide a flexible web application for animal health practitioners to assess the vulnerability of a particular network to pathogen spread.",

    "abstract": "The Comprehensive In-vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative aims to refine the assessment of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) risk, utilizing computational models to predict cardiac drug toxicity. Despite advancements in machine learning applications for this purpose, the specific contribution of in-silico biomarkers to toxicity risk levels has yet to be thoroughly elucidated. This study addresses this gap by implementing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to illuminate the impact of individual biomarkers in drug toxicity prediction. We employed the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate a detailed dataset for 28 drugs, from which twelve in-silico biomarkers of 12 drugs were computed to train various machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. Our study's innovation is leveraging XAI, mainly through the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, to dissect and quantify the contributions of biomarkers across these models. Furthermore, the model performance was evaluated using the test set from 16 drugs. We found that the ANN model coupled with the eleven most influential in-silico biomarkers namely showed the highest classification performance among all classifiers with Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.92 for predicting high-risk, 0.83 for intermediate-risk, and 0.98 for low-risk drugs. We also found that the optimal in silico biomarkers selected based on SHAP analysis may be different for various classification models. However, we also found that the biomarker selection only sometimes improved the performance; therefore, evaluating various classifiers is still essential to obtain the desired classification performance. Our proposed method could provide a systematic way to assess the best classifier with the optimal in-silico biomarkers for predicting the TdP risk of drugs, thereby advancing the field of cardiac safety evaluations.",

To address this challenge, we propose a Molecule Graph Contrastive Learning approach based on the Transformer framework (T-MGCL). Our approach involves expanding numerous unsupervised molecular graphs and using a contrast estimator to ensure consistency among various graph expansions of the same molecule. Transformer framework is employed to consider the distance between atoms and molecular graph attributes, thereby accounting for structural information that may be overlooked by traditional graph neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the T-MGCL model outperforms other models in several molecular property prediction tasks. Additionally, we observe that the attention weight learned by T-MGCL can be easily explained from a chemical perspective.",

    "abstract": "DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) are large, pooled collections of compounds in which every library member is attached to a stretch of DNA encoding its complete synthetic history. DEL-based hit discovery involves affinity selection of the library against a protein of interest, whereby compounds retained by the target are subsequently identified by next-generation sequencing of the corresponding DNA tags. When analyzing the resulting data, one typically assumes that sequencing output (i.e., read counts) is proportional to the binding affinity of a given compound, thus enabling hit prioritization and elucidation of any underlying structure-activity relationships (SAR). This assumption, though, tends to be severely confounded by a number of factors, including variable reaction yields, presence of incomplete products masquerading as their intended counterparts, and sequencing noise. In practice, these confounders are often ignored, potentially contributing to low hit validation rates, and universally leading to loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we have developed a method for comprehensively denoising DEL selection outputs. Our method, dubbed \"deldenoiser\", is based on sparse learning and leverages inputs that are commonly available within a DEL generation and screening workflow. Using simulated and publicly available DEL affinity selection data, we show that \"deldenoiser\" is not only able to recover and rank true binders much more robustly than read count-based approaches but also that it yields scores, which accurately capture the underlying SAR. The proposed method can, thus, be of significant utility in hit prioritization following DEL screens.",

    "abstract": "In brain-computer interface (BCI), building accurate electroencephalogram (EEG) classifiers for specific mental tasks is critical for BCI performance. The classifiers are developed by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, requiring a large dataset for training to build reliable and accurate models. However, collecting large enough EEG datasets is difficult due to intra-/inter-subject variabilities and experimental costs. This leads to the data scarcity problem, which causes overfitting issues to training samples, resulting in reducing generalization performance. To solve the EEG data scarcity problem and improve the performance of the EEG classifiers, we propose a novel EEG data augmentation (DA) framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). An experimental study is implemented with two public EEG datasets, including motor imagery (MI) tasks (BCI competition IV IIa and III IVa), to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EEG DA method for the EEG classifiers. To evaluate the proposed cGAN-based DA method, we tested eight EEG classifiers for the experiment, including traditional MLs and state-of-the-art DLs with three existing EEG DA methods. Experimental results showed that most DA methods with proper DA proportion in the training dataset had higher classification performances than without DA. Moreover, applying the proposed DA method showed superior classification performance improvement than the other DA methods. This shows that the proposed method is a promising EEG DA method for enhancing the performances of the EEG classifiers in MI-based BCIs.",

While the current clinical standard prognostic marker for PCa is the Gleason score, it is subject to inter-reviewer variability. This study compares two machine learning methods for discriminating between cancerous regions on digitized histology from 47 PCa patients. Whole-slide images were annotated by a GU fellowship-trained pathologist for each Gleason pattern. High-resolution tiles were extracted from annotated and unlabeled tissue. Patients were separated into a training set of 31 patients (Cohort A, n = 9345 tiles) and a testing cohort of 16 patients (Cohort B, n = 4375 tiles). Tiles from Cohort A were used to train a ResNet model, and glands from these tiles were segmented to calculate pathomic features to train a bagged ensemble model to discriminate tumors as (1) cancer and noncancer, (2) high- and low-grade cancer from noncancer, and (3) all Gleason patterns. The outputs of these models were compared to ground-truth pathologist annotations. The ensemble and ResNet models had overall accuracies of 89% and 88%, respectively, at predicting cancer from noncancer. The ResNet model was additionally able to differentiate Gleason patterns on data from Cohort B while the ensemble model was not. Our results suggest that quantitative pathomic features calculated from PCa histology can distinguish regions of cancer; however, texture features captured by deep learning frameworks better differentiate unique Gleason patterns.",

    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) models are essential for extracting structured information from unstructured medical texts by identifying entities such as diseases, treatments, and conditions, enhancing clinical decision-making and research. Innovations in machine learning, particularly those involving Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)-based deep learning and large language models, have significantly advanced NER capabilities. However, their performance varies across medical datasets due to the complexity and diversity of medical terminology. Previous studies have often focused on overall performance, neglecting specific challenges in medical contexts and the impact of macrofactors like lexical composition on prediction accuracy. These gaps hinder the development of optimized NER models for medical applications. This study aims to meticulously evaluate the performance of various NER models in the context of medical text analysis, focusing on how complex medical terminology affects entity recognition accuracy. Additionally, we explored the influence of macrofactors on model performance, seeking to provide insights for refining NER models and enhancing their reliability for medical applications. This study comprehensively evaluated 7 NER models-hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, BERT for Biomedical Text Mining, Big Transformer Models for Efficient Long-Sequence Attention, Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention, Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach, and Gemma-across 3 medical datasets: Revised Joint Workshop on Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine and its Applications (JNLPBA), BioCreative V CDR, and Anatomical Entity Mention (AnatEM). The evaluation focused on prediction accuracy, resource use (eg, central processing unit and graphics processing unit use), and the impact of fine-tuning hyperparameters. The macrofactors affecting model performance were also screened using the multilevel factor elimination algorithm. The fine-tuned BERT for Biomedical Text Mining, with balanced resource use, generally achieved the highest prediction accuracy across the Revised JNLPBA and AnatEM datasets, with microaverage (AVG_MICRO) scores of 0.932 and 0.8494, respectively, highlighting its superior proficiency in identifying medical entities. Gemma, fine-tuned using the low-rank adaptation technique, achieved the highest accuracy on the BioCreative V CDR dataset with an AVG_MICRO score of 0.9962 but exhibited variability across the other datasets (AVG_MICRO scores of 0.9088 on the Revised JNLPBA and 0.8029 on AnatEM), indicating a need for further optimization. In addition, our analysis revealed that 2 macrofactors, entity phrase length and the number of entity words in each entity phrase, significantly influenced model performance. This study highlights the essential role of NER models in medical informatics, emphasizing the imperative for model optimization via precise data targeting and fine-tuning. The insights from this study will notably improve clinical decision-making and facilitate the creation of more sophisticated and effective medical NER models.",

    "title": "Optimising Personalised Medical Insights by Introducing a Scalable Health Informatics Application for Sensor Data Extraction, Preprocessing, and Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Wearable sensors, among other informatics solutions, are readily accessible to enable noninvasive remote monitoring in healthcare. While providing a wealth of data, the wide variety of such sensing systems and the differing implementations of the same or similar sensors by different developers complicate comparisons of collected data. An online application as a platform technology that provides uniform methods for analysing balance data is presented as a case study. The development of balance problems is common in neurodegenerative conditions, leading to falls and a reduced quality of life. While balance can be assessed using, for example, perturbation tests, sensors offer a more quantitative and scalable way. Researchers can adjust the platform to integrate the sensors of their choice or upload data and then preprocess, featurise, analyse, and visualise them. This eases performing comparative analyses across the sensors and datasets through a reduction of heterogeneity and facilitates easy integration of machine learning and other advanced data analytics, thereby targeting personalising medical insights.",

    "abstract": "Currently, pain assessment using electroencephalogram signals and machine learning methods in clinical studies is of great importance, especially for those who cannot express their pain. Since newborns are among the high-risk group and always experience pain at the beginning of birth, in this research, the severity of newborns has been investigated and evaluated. Other studies related to the annoyance of newborns have used the EEG signal of newborns alone; therefore, in this study, the intensity of newborn pain was measured using the electroencephalogram signal of 107 infants who were stimulated by the heel lance in three levels: no pain, low pain and moderate pain were recorded as a single trial and evaluated. The support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Ensemble bagging classifiers were trained using the K-fold cross-validation method and features of the brain's time-frequency domain. The results were obtained with accuracies of 72.8 ± 2, 84.4 ± 1.3 and 82.9 ± 1.6%, respectively. Also, in examining the problem of distinguishing pain and no pain, the electroencephalogram signal of 74 infants was evaluated, and similar to the three-class mode, with the 10-fold validation method, we reached the highest accuracy of 100% in Bagging classifier and 98.6 ± 0.1 accuracy in KNN and SVM classifiers.",

    "title": "Identifying Ethical Considerations for Machine Learning Healthcare Applications.",
    "abstract": "Along with potential benefits to healthcare delivery, machine learning healthcare applications (ML-HCAs) raise a number of ethical concerns. Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.",

Due to the computational cost of quantum chemistry methods and the immense number of theoretically possible stable compounds, comprehensive in silico screening remains prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we combine atom-in-molecule-based fragments, dubbed 'amons' (A), with active learning in transferable quantum machine learning (ML) models. The efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability of the resulting AML models is demonstrated for important molecular quantum properties such as energies, forces, atomic charges, NMR shifts and polarizabilities and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, Watson-Crick DNA base pairs and even ubiquitin. Conceptually, the AML approach extends Mendeleev's table to account effectively for chemical environments, which allows the systematic reconstruction of many chemistries from local building blocks.

A large number of AML models has been developed, but their implementations are scattered among different packages, each with its own conventions for input and output. Thus, here we give an overview of our MLatom 2 software package, which provides an integrative platform for a wide variety of AML simulations by implementing from scratch and interfacing existing software for a range of state-of-the-art models. These include kernel method-based model types such as KREG (native implementation), sGDML, and GAP-SOAP as well as neural-network-based model types such as ANI, DeepPot-SE, and PhysNet. The theoretical foundations behind these methods are overviewed too. The modular structure of MLatom allows for easy extension to more AML model types. MLatom 2 also has many other capabilities useful for AML simulations, such as the support of custom descriptors, farthest-point and structure-based sampling, hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation, and automatic learning curve generation. It can also be used for such multi-step tasks as Δ-learning, self-correction approaches, and absorption spectrum simulation within the machine-learning nuclear-ensemble approach. Several of these MLatom 2 capabilities are showcased in application examples.",

    "abstract": "Surgical resection is one of the most relevant practices in neurosurgery. Finding the correct surgical extent of the tumor is a key question and so far several techniques have been employed to assist the neurosurgeon in preserving the maximum amount of healthy tissue. Some of these methods are invasive for patients, not always allowing high precision in the detection of the tumor area. The aim of this study is to overcome these limitations, developing machine learning based models, relying on features obtained from a contactless and non-invasive technique, the thermal infrared (IR) imaging. The thermal IR videos of thirteen patients with heterogeneous tumors were recorded in the intraoperative context. Time (TD)- and frequency (FD)-domain features were extracted and fed different machine learning models. Models relying on FD features have proven to be the best solutions for the optimal detection of the tumor area (Average Accuracy = 90.45%; Average Sensitivity = 84.64%; Average Specificity = 93,74%). The obtained results highlight the possibility to accurately detect the tumor lesion boundary with a completely non-invasive, contactless, and portable technology, revealing thermal IR imaging as a very promising tool for the neurosurgeon.",

However, even with high-throughput screens, experimental methods are insufficient to explore novel drug combinations.

In recent decades, more and more machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to improve the predictive performance. The object of this study is to introduce and discuss the recent applications of ML methods and the widely used databases in drug combination prediction. In this study, we first describe the concept and controversy of synergism between drug combinations. Then, we investigate various publicly available data resources and tools for prediction tasks. Next, ML methods including classic ML and deep learning methods applied in drug combination prediction are introduced.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models for predicting IR spectra of molecular ions (infrared ion spectroscopy, IRIS) have yet to be reported owing to the relatively sparse experimental data sets available. To overcome this limitation, we employ the Graphormer-IR model for neutral molecules as a knowledgeable starting point and then employ transfer learning to refine the model to predict the spectra of gaseous ions. A library of 10,336 computed spectra and a small data set of 312 experimental IRIS spectra is used for model fine-tuning. Nonspecific global graph encodings that describe the molecular charge state ( ., (de)protonation, sodiation), combined with an additional transfer learning step that considers computed spectra for ions, improved model performance. The resulting Graphormer-IRIS model yields spectra that are 21% more accurate than those produced by commonly employed DFT quantum chemical models, while capturing subtle phenomena such as spectral red-shifts due to sodiation. Dimensionality reduction of model embeddings demonstrates derived \"chemical intuition\" of functional groups, trends in molecular electron density, and the location of charge sites. Our approach will enable fast IRIS predictions for determining the structures of unknown small molecule analytes ( ., metabolites, lipids) present in biological samples.",

    "title": "Highly accurate and explainable detection of specimen mix-up using a machine learning model.",
    "abstract": "Background Delta check is widely used for detecting specimen mix-ups. Owing to the inadequate specificity and sparseness of the absolute incidence of mix-ups, the positive predictive value (PPV) of delta check is considerably low as it is labor consuming to identify true mix-up errors among a large number of false alerts. To overcome this problem, we developed a new accurate detection model through machine learning. Methods Inspired by delta check, we decided to conduct comparisons with the past examinations and broaden the time range. Fifteen common items were selected from complete blood cell counts and biochemical tests. We considered examinations in which ≥11 among the 15 items were measured simultaneously in our hospital; we created individual partial time-series data of the consecutive examinations with a sliding window size of 4. The last examinations of the partial time-series data were shuffled to generate artificial mix-up cases. After splitting the dataset into development and validation sets, we allowed a gradient-boosting-decision-tree (GBDT) model to learn using the development set to detect whether the last examination results of the partial time-series data were artificial mixed-up results. The model's performance was evaluated on the validation set. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of our model was 0.9983 (bootstrap confidence interval [bsCI]: 0.9983-0.9985). Conclusions The GBDT model was more effective in detecting specimen mix-up. The improved accuracy will enable more facilities to perform more efficient and centralized mix-up detection, leading to improved patient safety.",

    "title": "Machine Learning Models Predict Calculation Outcomes with the Transferability Necessary for Computational Catalysis.",
    "abstract": "Virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) and machine learning (ML) have greatly accelerated the design of single-site transition-metal catalysts. VHTS of catalysts, however, is often accompanied with a high calculation failure rate and wasted computational resources due to the difficulty of simultaneously converging all mechanistically relevant reactive intermediates to expected geometries and electronic states. We demonstrate a dynamic classifier approach, i.e., a convolutional neural network that monitors geometry optimizations on the fly, and exploit its good performance and transferability in identifying geometry optimization failures for catalyst design. We show that the dynamic classifier performs well on all reactive intermediates in the representative catalytic cycle of the radical rebound mechanism for the conversion of methane to methanol despite being trained on only one reactive intermediate. The dynamic classifier also generalizes to chemically distinct intermediates and metal centers absent from the training data without loss of accuracy or model confidence. We rationalize this superior model transferability as arising from the use of electronic structure and geometric information generated on-the-fly from density functional theory calculations and the convolutional layer in the dynamic classifier. When used in combination with uncertainty quantification, the dynamic classifier saves more than half of the computational resources that would have been wasted on unsuccessful calculations for all reactive intermediates being considered.",

The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.",

According to current research, machine learning techniques are widely applied in the process of the discovery of new drugs and novel drug targets, the decision surrounding proper therapy and drug dose, and the prediction of drug efficacy and adverse drug reactions. In this article, we discussed the history, workflow, and advantages and disadvantages of machine learning techniques in the processes mentioned above. Although the advantages of machine learning techniques are fairly obvious, the application of machine learning techniques is currently limited. With further research, the application of machine techniques in drug development could be much more widespread and could potentially be one of the major methods used in drug development.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of homologous relationships of biological sequences (DNA or amino acid) amongst organisms is an important and often difficult task that is essential to various evolutionary studies, ranging from building phylogenies to predicting functional gene annotations. There are many existing heuristic tools, most commonly based on bidirectional BLAST searches that are used to identify homologous genes and combine them into two fundamentally distinct classes: orthologs and paralogs. Due to only using heuristic filtering based on significance score cutoffs and having no cluster post-processing tools available, these methods can often produce multiple clusters constituting unrelated (non-homologous) sequences. Therefore sequencing data extracted from incomplete genome/transcriptome assemblies originated from low coverage sequencing or produced by de novo processes without a reference genome are susceptible to high false positive rates of homology detection. In this paper we develop biologically informative features that can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments of putative homologous genes (orthologs and paralogs) and further utilized in context of guided experimentation to verify false positive outcomes. We demonstrate that our machine learning method trained on both known homology clusters obtained from OrthoDB and randomly generated sequence alignments (non-homologs), successfully determines apparent false positives inferred by heuristic algorithms especially among proteomes recovered from low-coverage RNA-seq data. Almost ~42 % and ~25 % of predicted putative homologies by InParanoid and HaMStR respectively were classified as false positives on experimental data set. Our process increases the quality of output from other clustering algorithms by providing a novel post-processing method that is both fast and efficient at removing low quality clusters of putative homologous genes recovered by heuristic-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is exposed to the curse of dimensionality risk, and it is even more exacerbated with high-dimensional data such as microarrays. Moreover, the low-instance/high-feature (LIHF) property of microarray data needs considerable processing time to do some calculations and comparisons among features to choose the best subset of them, which has led to many efforts to subdue the LIHF property of such genomic medicine data. Due to the promising results of the ensemble models in machine learning problems, this paper presents a novel framework, named feature-level aggregation-based ensemble based on overlapped feature subspace partitioning (FLAE-OFSP) for microarray data classification. The proposed ensemble has three main steps: after generating several subsets by the proposed partitioning approach, a feature selection algorithm (i.e., a feature ranker) is applied on each subset, and finally, their results are combined into a single ranked list using six defined aggregation functions. Evaluation of the presented framework based on seven microarray datasets and using four measures, including stability, classification accuracy, runtime, and Modscore shows substantial runtime improvement and also quality results in other evaluated measures compared to individual methods.",

    "title": "MultiToxPred 1.0: a novel comprehensive tool for predicting 27 classes of protein toxins using an ensemble machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Protein toxins are defense mechanisms and adaptations found in various organisms and microorganisms, and their use in scientific research as therapeutic candidates is gaining relevance due to their effectiveness and specificity against cellular targets. However, discovering these toxins is time-consuming and expensive. In silico tools, particularly those based on machine learning and deep learning, have emerged as valuable resources to address this challenge. Existing tools primarily focus on binary classification, determining whether a protein is a toxin or not, and occasionally identifying specific types of toxins. For the first time, we propose a novel approach capable of classifying protein toxins into 27 distinct categories based on their mode of action within cells. To accomplish this, we assessed multiple machine learning techniques and found that an ensemble model incorporating the Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms exhibited the best performance. During the tenfold cross-validation on the training dataset, our model exhibited notable metrics: 0.840 accuracy, 0.827 F1 score, 0.836 precision, 0.840 sensitivity, and 0.989 AUC. In the testing stage, using an independent dataset, the model achieved 0.846 accuracy, 0.838 F1 score, 0.847 precision, 0.849 sensitivity, and 0.991 AUC. These results present a powerful next-generation tool called MultiToxPred 1.0, accessible through a web application. We believe that MultiToxPred 1.0 has the potential to become an indispensable resource for researchers, facilitating the efficient identification of protein toxins. By leveraging this tool, scientists can accelerate their search for these toxins and advance their understanding of their therapeutic potential.",

    "title": "Integrating generative AI and machine learning classifiers for solving heterogenous MCGDM: a case of employee churn prediction.",
    "abstract": "Employee churn is a critical issue for companies and organizations, as it directly impacts productivity, efficiency, and overall operational success. High turnover rates increase recruitment and training costs, and disrupt workflows, making it a top concern for institutions aiming to maintain stability, growth and continuity. This study presents a methodology to address the employee churn prediction problem in heterogeneous environments by framing it as a Multiple Criteria Group Decision Making (MCGDM) problem. The proposed methodology integrates generative AI, Traditional MCGDM techniques, and machine learning classifiers to handle this problem type. The proposed methodology is structured into four main stages: data collection, generative AI for creating expert profiles, MCGDM for employee ranking, and machine learning for predictive modeling. ChatGPT-4 is used as the generative AI model to simulate expert profiles from diverse fields related to churn prediction. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to calculate criteria weights, while the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is concerned with alternatives' ranking and employee's classification into churn likelihood categories. These rankings data are then used for different nine machine learning classifiers, reducing the computational complexity for future predictions. The results reveal that Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest outperform other used models in predicting employee churn in terms of accuracy. The proposed methodology offers a scalable, data-driven solution for addressing MCGDM problems, particularly employee churn prediction, by integrating advanced AI techniques with traditional decision-making frameworks.",

    "title": "Improving the performance of supervised deep learning for regulatory genomics using phylogenetic augmentation.",
    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning is used to model the complex relationship between genomic sequence and regulatory function. Understanding how these models make predictions can provide biological insight into regulatory functions. Given the complexity of the sequence to regulatory function mapping (the cis-regulatory code), it has been suggested that the genome contains insufficient sequence variation to train models with suitable complexity. Data augmentation is a widely used approach to increase the data variation available for model training, however current data augmentation methods for genomic sequence data are limited. Inspired by the success of comparative genomics, we show that augmenting genomic sequences with evolutionarily related sequences from other species, which we term phylogenetic augmentation, improves the performance of deep learning models trained on regulatory genomic sequences to predict high-throughput functional assay measurements. Additionally, we show that phylogenetic augmentation can rescue model performance when the training set is down-sampled and permits deep learning on a real-world small dataset, demonstrating that this approach improves data efficiency. Overall, this data augmentation method represents a solution for improving model performance that is applicable to many supervised deep-learning problems in genomics. The open-source GitHub repository agduncan94/phylogenetic_augmentation_paper includes the code for rerunning the analyses here and recreating the figures.",

    "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is one of the most important component in prognostic health management (PHM) system in modern industry. It defined as the length from the current time to the end of the useful life. With the rapid development of the smart manufacturing, the data-driven RUL approaches have been widely investigated in both academic and engineering fields. Deep learning, which is a new paradigm in machine learning, has been applied in the RUL related fields, and has achieved remarkable results. However, classical deep learning algorithms also encounter the vanishing/exploding gradient problem found in artificial neural network with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In this research, a new residual convolutional neural network (ResCNN) is proposed. ResCNN applies the residual block which skips several blocks of convolutional layers by using shortcut connections, and can help to overcome vanishing/exploding gradient problem. What's more, the ResCNN is enhanced by using the k-fold ensemble method. The proposed ensemble ResCNN is conducted on the C-MAPSS data provided by NASA. The results show that the proposed ensemble ResCNN has achieved significant improvement in both the mean and the standard deviation of the prediction RUL values. The proposed ensemble ResCNN has also compared with other famous machine learning and deep learning methods, including Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Deep Belief Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Model, Convolutional Neural Network and many other methods in literatures. The comparison results show that ensemble ResCNN achieved the start-of-the-art results, and outperform almost all of them.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of computer science, there is an increasing demand for the use of causal inference methods and machine learning in the research of endocrine disorders and their long-term health outcomes. However, studies on the effective and appropriate applications of these approaches in real-world data and clinical settings are still limited. This review will illustrate the use of causal inference and machine learning in epidemiological research within the field of endocrinology and metabolism. It will examine each concept of causal inference and machine learning through application examples of endocrine disorders. Subsequently, the paper will discuss the integration of machine learning within the causal inference framework, including (i) the estimation of treatment effects or the causal relationship between exposure and outcomes, and (ii) the evaluation of heterogeneity in such treatment effects (or exposure-outcome causal relationship) based on individuals' characteristics. Accurately assessing causal relationships and their heterogeneity across different individuals is crucial not only for determining effective interventions, but also for the appropriate allocation of medical resources and reducing healthcare disparities. By illustrating some application examples in endocrinology, this review aims to enhance readers' understanding and application of causal inference and machine learning in future epidemiological studies focusing on endocrine disorders.",

One of the most obvious consequences is the insufficient reproducibility found in current prediction models. In an attempt to characterize methods to improve reproducibility and to allow for better clinical performance, we utilize a previously proposed taxonomy that separates reproducibility into 3 components: technical, statistical, and conceptual reproducibility. By following this framework, we discuss common errors that lead to poor reproducibility, highlight the importance of generalizability when evaluating a ML model's performance, and provide suggestions to optimize generalizability to ensure adequate performance. These efforts are a necessity before such models are applied to patient care.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of cloud computing (CC) has increased significantly in recent years due to its cost-effectiveness and simplified resource allocation. Owing to the exponential rise of cloud computing in the past decade, many corporations and businesses have moved to the cloud to ensure accessibility, scalability, and transparency. The proposed research involves comparing the accuracy and fault prediction of five machine learning algorithms: AdaBoostM1, Bagging, Decision Tree (J48), Deep Learning (Dl4jMLP), and Naive Bayes Tree (NB Tree). The results from secondary data analysis indicate that the Central Processing Unit CPU-Mem Multi classifier has the highest accuracy percentage and the least amount of fault prediction. This holds for the Decision Tree (J48) classifier with an accuracy rate of 89.71% for 80/20, 90.28% for 70/30, and 92.82% for 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the Hard Disk Drive HDD-Mono classifier has an accuracy rate of 90.35% for 80/20, 92.35% for 70/30, and 90.49% for 10-fold cross-validation. The AdaBoostM1 classifier was found to have the highest accuracy percentage and the least amount of fault prediction for the HDD Multi classifier with an accuracy rate of 93.63% for 80/20, 90.09% for 70/30, and 88.92% for 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the CPU-Mem Mono classifier has an accuracy rate of 77.87% for 80/20, 77.01% for 70/30, and 77.06% for 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the primary data results, the Naive Bayes Tree (NB Tree) classifier is found to have the highest accuracy rate with less fault prediction of 97.05% for 80/20, 96.09% for 70/30, and 96.78% for 10 folds cross-validation. However, the algorithm complexity is not good, taking 1.01 seconds. On the other hand, the Decision Tree (J48) has the second-highest accuracy rate of 96.78%, 95.95%, and 96.78% for 80/20, 70/30, and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. J48 also has less fault prediction but with a good algorithm complexity of 0.11 seconds. The difference in accuracy and less fault prediction between NB Tree and J48 is only 0.9%, but the difference in time complexity is 9 seconds. Based on the results, we have decided to make modifications to the Decision Tree (J48) algorithm. This method has been proposed as it offers the highest accuracy and less fault prediction errors, with 97.05% accuracy for the 80/20 split, 96.42% for the 70/30 split, and 97.07% for the 10-fold cross-validation.",

    "abstract": "Atom mapping of a chemical reaction is a mapping between the atoms in the reactant molecules and the atoms in the product molecules. It encodes the underlying reaction mechanism and, as such, constitutes essential information in computational studies in drug design. Various techniques have been investigated for the automatic computation of the atom mapping of a chemical reaction, approaching the problem as a graph matching problem. The graph abstraction of the chemical problem, though, eliminates crucial chemical information. There have been efforts for enhancing the graph representation by introducing the bond stabilities as edge weights, as they are estimated based on experimental evidence. Here, we present a fully automated optimization-based approach, named AMLGAM (Automated Machine Learning Guided Atom Mapping), that uses machine learning techniques for the estimation of the bond stabilities based on the chemical environment of each bond. The optimization method finds the reaction mechanism which favors the breakage/formation of the less stable bonds. We evaluated our method on a manually curated data set of 382 chemical reactions and ran our method on a much larger and diverse data set of 7400 chemical reactions. We show that the proposed method improves the accuracy over existing techniques based on results published by earlier studies on a common data set and is capable of handling unbalanced reactions.",

Here, we proposed a machine learning-based approach for HF recommendation with enhanced interpretability and applicability. A dataset consisting of clinical symptoms, Sasang constitution (SC) types, and prescribed HFs was derived from a multicenter study. Case studies published over 10 years were collected and curated by experts. Various classifiers, oversampling methods, and data imputation techniques were comprehensively considered. The local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) technique was applied to identify the clinical symptoms that led to the recommendation of specific HFs. We found that the cascaded deep forest (CDF) model with data imputation and oversampling yielded the best performance on the training set and holdout test set. Our model also achieved top-1 and top-3 accuracies of 0.35 and 0.89, respectively, on case study datasets in which clinical symptoms were only partially recorded. We performed an expert evaluation on the reliability of interpretation results using case studies and achieved a score close to normal. Taken together, our model will contribute to the modernization of KM and the identification of an HF selection process through the development of a practically useful HF recommendation model.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in technology, such as the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have facilitated the progression of the biopharmaceutical industry toward the implementation of Industry 4.0. As per the guidelines set by the USFDA, process validation for biopharmaceutical production consists of three stages: process design, process qualification, and continuous process verification (CPV). This paper proposes a strategy for achieving CPV for a cation exchange chromatography unit operation, emphasizing the urgent need for such strategies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Statistical process control (SPC) charts were generated based on real-time measurement of the various critical process parameters (CPPs) measured via in-built sensors (pH, conductivity, UV, and delta column pressure) as well as of critical quality attributes (CQAs) like charge variant composition (Raman spectroscopy) and concentration (Near infrared spectroscopy). A Python-based program was created to read these SPC charts and respond to any deviation. The developed models for NIR coupled DNN PAT tool and Raman coupled DNN PAT tool exhibited satisfactory R values (> 0.90), highlighting the statistical significance of the proposed model. Further, the control strategy designed based on Raman spectroscopy for charge variant composition in CEX eluate has been demonstrated by intentional perturbations in the CEX load. The resulting CEX eluate output showed a consistent charge variant composition as that of control runs (acidic ∼20 ± 2 %, main ∼62 ± 2 % and basic ∼18 ± 2 %). It has been demonstrated how an appropriate selection of analyzers, soft sensors, and advanced data analytics can be used to execute CPV and enable the biopharmaceutical industry to implement Industry 4.0.",

    "abstract": "A priori knowledge of physicochemical properties such as melting and boiling could expedite materials discovery. However, theoretical modeling from first principles poses a challenge for efficient virtual screening of potential candidates. As an alternative, the tools of data science are becoming increasingly important for exploring chemical datasets and predicting material properties. Herein, we extend a molecular representation, or set of descriptors, first developed for quantitative structure-property relationship modeling by Yalkowsky and coworkers known as the Unified Physicochemical Property Estimation Relationships (UPPER). This molecular representation has group-constitutive and geometrical descriptors that map to enthalpy and entropy; two thermodynamic quantities that drive thermal phase transitions. We extend the UPPER representation to include additional information about sp -bonded fragments. Additionally, instead of using the UPPER descriptors in a series of thermodynamically-inspired calculations, as per Yalkowsky, we use the descriptors to construct a vector representation for use with machine learning techniques. The concise and easy-to-compute representation, combined with a gradient-boosting decision tree model, provides an appealing framework for predicting experimental transition temperatures in a diverse chemical space. An application to energetic materials shows that the method is predictive, despite a relatively modest energetics reference dataset. We also report competitive results on diverse public datasets of melting points (i.e., OCHEM, Enamine, Bradley, and Bergström) comprised of over 47k structures.

In response, there is a growing trend toward the use of machine learning (ML) approaches that encompass multivariate tools for effective SERS data analysis. This comprehensive review delves into the detailed steps needed to be considered when applying ML techniques for SERS analysis. Additionally, we explored a range of environmental applications where different ML tools were integrated with SERS for the detection of pathogens and (in)organic pollutants in environmental samples.

    "abstract": "The investigation of sediment transport in tropical rivers is essential for planning effective integrated river basin management to predict the changes in rivers. The characteristics of rivers and sediment in the tropical region are different compared to those of the rivers in Europe and the USA, where the median sediment size tends to be much more refined. The origins of the rivers are mainly tropical forests. Due to the complexity of determining sediment transport, many sediment transport equations were recommended in the literature. However, the accuracy of the prediction results remains low, particularly for the tropical rivers. The majority of the existing equations were developed using multiple non-linear regression (MNLR). Machine learning has recently been the method of choice to increase model prediction accuracy in complex hydrological problems. Compared to the conventional MNLR method, machine learning algorithms have advanced and can produce a useful prediction model. In this research, three machine learning models, namely evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) and M5 tree model (M5P), were implemented to model sediment transport for rivers in Malaysia. The formulated variables for the prediction model were originated from the revised equations reported in the relevant literature for Malaysian rivers. Among the three machine learning models, in terms of different statistical measurement criteria, EPR gives the best prediction model, followed by MGGP and M5P. Machine learning is excellent at improving the prediction distribution of high data values but lacks accuracy compared to observations of lower data values. These results indicate that further study needs to be done to improve the machine learning model's accuracy to predict sediment transport.",

Our study utilizes a Poisson distribution model to efficiently detect DDoS attacks with a computational complexity of O( ).

We validate this approach with four virtual machines on the CDX 3.0 platform, each simulating different aspects of DDoS attacks for offensive, monitoring, and defense evaluation purposes. The study further analyzes seven diverse DDoS attack methods. When compared with existing methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance, highlighting its potential effectiveness in real-world DDoS attack detection.",

    "abstract": "Use of artificial intelligence in healthcare, such as machine learning-based predictive algorithms, holds promise for advancing outcomes, but few systems are used in routine clinical practice. Trust has been cited as an important challenge to meaningful use of artificial intelligence in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence systems often involve automating cognitively challenging tasks. Therefore, previous literature on trust in automation may hold important lessons for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. In this perspective, we argue that informatics should take lessons from literature on trust in automation such that the goal should be to foster appropriate trust in artificial intelligence based on the purpose of the tool, its process for making recommendations, and its performance in the given context. We adapt a conceptual model to support this argument and present recommendations for future work.",

Applying AI/ML methods to lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has shown slower progress, especially regarding predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology properties. The present review surveys reasons why this is so, reports progress that has occurred in recent years, and summarizes some of the issues that remain.

    "title": "Psychological improvement in Employee Productivity by Maintaining Attendance System using Machine Learning Behavior.",
    "abstract": "For a very long time, researchers, educationists, practitioners, and psychologists have tried to conduct extensive research on employee productivity at the workplace. It was firmly believed that positive traits of the employees positively affect the performance of employees at the workplace and, at the same time, increase the productivity of the organization. A few organizations have changed their organizational policies to improve employee performance by identifying individuals' positive traits. Positive psychology (PS), unlike traditional psychology, focuses on the positive traits of the individuals rather than on their negative aspects. Hence, this paper intends to analyze the important role of PS in improving employee productivity as well as analyze the psychological improvement in Employee Productivity by Maintaining Attendance Systems, Implementing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR activities), Entrepreneurial Intentions (EI), and Machine Learning Behavior (MLB). This study paper investigates the role of attendance systems, CSR, EI, and MLB in enhancing the employees' productivity in a positive manner, which will eventually increase organizational productivity. This study proposes a research framework and hypothesis that explains the relationship between employee productivity and organizational attendance system, CSR, EI, and MLB. For this study, a questionnaire was prepared and distributed among the employees working in the selected organizations. These data verify the validity of the proposed hypothesis and research framework. Statistical approaches were employed to analyze the results of the proposed hypothesis. Results of the study found that by maintaining an attendance system, implementing CSR, EI, and MLB, employee performance can be improved positively, thereby increasing organizational productivity.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has been attracting increasing attention for use in healthcare applications, including neonatal medicine. One application for this tool is in understanding and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. In this study, we have carried out a systematic review to identify findings and challenges to date. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Four databases were searched in February 2022, with articles then screened in a non-blinded manner by two authors. The literature search returned 278 studies, with 11 meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Convolutional neural networks were the most common machine learning approach, with most studies seeking to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes from images and connectomes describing brain structure and function. Studies to date also sought to identify features predictive of outcomes; however, results varied greatly. Initial studies in this field have achieved promising results; however, many machine learning techniques remain to be explored, and the consensus is yet to be reached on which clinical and brain features are most predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. This systematic review looks at the question of whether machine learning can be used to predict and understand neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. Our review finds that promising initial works have been conducted in this field, but many challenges and opportunities remain. Quality assessment of relevant articles is conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This work identifies challenges that remain and suggests several key directions for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review to explore this topic.",

The combined time-series learning method and consumer behaviours, estimated from water-use data (hour/day), were used as the supplementary inputs of the hybrid KELM models. Comparison of model performances for different input combinations revealed the best performance using up to 2-day lag values of COD with the other wastewater properties. The results also showed the best performance of the KELM-salp swarm algorithm (SSA) model among all the hybrid models with a minimum root mean square error of 0.058 and mean absolute error of 0.044.",

While machine learning methods show promise in this domain, achieving accuracy and generalization across diverse data sets remains a challenge. This study introduces Geometric Graph Learning for Protein-Protein Interactions (GGL-PPI), a novel approach integrating geometric graph representation and machine learning to forecast mutation-induced binding free energy changes. GGL-PPI leverages atom-level graph coloring and multiscale weighted colored geometric subgraphs to capture structural features of biomolecules, demonstrating superior performance on three standard data sets, namely, AB-Bind, SKEMPI 1.0, and SKEMPI 2.0 data sets. The model's efficacy extends to predicting protein thermodynamic stability in a blind test set, providing unbiased predictions for both direct and reverse mutations and showcasing notable generalization. GGL-PPI's precision in predicting changes in binding free energy and stability due to mutations enhances our comprehension of protein complexes, offering valuable insights for drug design endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Emotions play a critical role in our daily lives, so the understanding and recognition of emotional responses is crucial for human research. Affective computing research has mostly used non-immersive two-dimensional (2D) images or videos to elicit emotional states. However, immersive virtual reality, which allows researchers to simulate environments in controlled laboratory conditions with high levels of sense of presence and interactivity, is becoming more popular in emotion research. Moreover, its synergy with implicit measurements and machine-learning techniques has the potential to impact transversely in many research areas, opening new opportunities for the scientific community. This paper presents a systematic review of the emotion recognition research undertaken with physiological and behavioural measures using head-mounted displays as elicitation devices. The results highlight the evolution of the field, give a clear perspective using aggregated analysis, reveal the current open issues and provide guidelines for future research.",

As such, they can suffer from ambient light changes when used outdoors, especially for use cases where eye trackers are embedded in Augmented Reality glasses. It has been recently suggested that ultrasound could provide a low power, fast, light-insensitive alternative to camera-based sensors for eye tracking. Here, we report on our work on modeling ultrasound sensor integration into a glasses form factor AR device to evaluate the feasibility of estimating eye-gaze in various configurations. Next, we designed a benchtop experimental setup to collect empirical data on time of flight and amplitude signals for reflected ultrasound waves for a range of gaze angles of a model eye. We used this data as input for a low-complexity gradient-boosted tree machine learning regression model and demonstrate that we can effectively estimate gaze (gaze RMSE error of 0.965 ± 0.178 degrees with an adjusted R2 score of 90.2 ± 4.6).",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that ranks among the leading causes of disability worldwide. However, many cases of schizophrenia remain untreated due to failure to diagnose, self-denial, and social stigma. With the advent of social media, individuals suffering from schizophrenia share their mental health problems and seek support and treatment options. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for detecting schizophrenia from social media posts. This study aims to determine whether machine learning could be effectively used to detect signs of schizophrenia in social media users by analyzing their social media texts. To this end, we collected posts from the social media platform Reddit focusing on schizophrenia, along with non-mental health related posts (fitness, jokes, meditation, parenting, relationships, and teaching) for the control group. We extracted linguistic features and content topics from the posts. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts belonging to schizophrenia and interpreted important features to identify linguistic markers of schizophrenia. We applied unsupervised clustering to the features to uncover a coherent semantic representation of words in schizophrenia. We identified significant differences in linguistic features and topics including increased use of third person plural pronouns and negative emotion words and symptom-related topics. We distinguished schizophrenic from control posts with an accuracy of 96%. Finally, we found that coherent semantic groups of words were the key to detecting schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches could help us understand the linguistic characteristics of schizophrenia and identify schizophrenia or otherwise at-risk individuals using social media texts.",

The SORG ML 90-day and 1-year machine learning algorithms for survival in spinal metastatic disease were previously developed in a single institutional sample but remain to be externally validated. The purpose of this study was to externally validate these algorithms in an independent population from another institution. Retrospective study at a large, tertiary care center. Patients 18 years or older who underwent surgery between 2003 and 2016. Ninety-day and 1-year mortality. Baseline characteristics of the validation cohort were compared to the developmental cohort for the SORG ML algorithms. Discrimination (c-statistic and receiver operating curve), calibration (calibration slope, intercept, calibration plot, and observed proportions by predicted risk groups), overall performance (Brier score), and decision curve analysis were used to assess the performance of the SORG ML algorithms in the validation cohort. Overall, 176 patients underwent surgery for spinal metastatic disease, of which 44 (22.7%) experienced 90-day mortality and 99 (56.2%) experienced 1-year mortality. The validation cohort differed significantly from the developmental cohort on primary tumor histology, metastatic tumor burden, previous systemic therapy, overall comorbidity burden, and preoperative laboratory characteristics. Despite these differences, the SORG ML algorithms generalized well to the validation cohort on discrimination (c-statistic 0.75-0.81 for 90-day mortality and 0.77-0.78 for 1-year mortality), calibration, Brier score, and decision curve analysis. Initial results from external validation of the SORG ML 90-day and 1-year algorithms for survival prediction in spinal metastatic disease suggest potential utility of these digital decision aids in clinical practice.

While these specialties have quickly embraced AI and ML, orthopedic surgery has been slower to do so. Fortunately, there has been a recent surge in new research emphasizing the need for a systematic review. The primary objective of this systematic review will be to provide an update on the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the applications of AI and ML in providing a clinical diagnosis and predicting post-operative outcomes and complications in orthopedic surgery. A systematic search will be conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for articles written in English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese language articles published up to September 2020. References will be screened and assessed for eligibility by at least two independent reviewers as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies must apply to orthopedic interventions and acute and chronic orthopedic musculoskeletal injuries to be considered eligible. Studies will be excluded if they are animal studies and do not relate to orthopedic interventions or if no clinical data were produced. Gold standard processes and practices to obtain a clinical diagnosis and predict post-operative outcomes shall be compared with and without the use of ML algorithms. Any case reports and other primary studies assessing the prediction rate of post-operative outcomes or the ability to identify a diagnosis in orthopedic surgery will be included. Systematic reviews or literature reviews will be examined to identify further studies for inclusion, and the results of meta-analyses will not be included in the analysis. Our findings will evaluate the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. We expect to find a large quantity of uncontrolled studies and a smaller subset of articles describing actual applications and outcomes for clinical care. Cohort studies and large randomized control trial will likely be needed. The protocol will be registered on PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews prior to commencement.",

    "title": "Machine learning-based estimation of evapotranspiration under adaptation conditions: a case study in Heilongjiang Province, China.",
    "abstract": "The prediction of evapotranspiration (ET0) is crucial for agricultural ecosystems, irrigation management, and environmental climate regulation. Traditional methods for predicting ET0 require a variety of meteorological parameters. However, obtaining data for these multiple parameters can be challenging, leading to inaccuracies or inability to predict ET0 using traditional methods. This affects decision-making in critical applications such as agricultural irrigation scheduling and water management, consequently impacting the development of agricultural ecosystems. This issue is particularly pronounced in economically underdeveloped regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning-based evapotranspiration estimation method adapted to evapotranspiration conditions. Compared to traditional methods, our approach relies less on the variety of meteorological parameters and yields higher prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a 'region of evapotranspiration adaptability' division method, which takes into account geographical differences in ET0 prediction. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of anomalies or missing data from individual meteorological stations, making our method more suitable for practical agricultural irrigation and ecosystem water resource management. We validated our approach using meteorological data from 25 stations in Heilongjiang, China. Our results indicate that non-adjacent geographical areas, despite different climatic conditions, can have similar impacts on ET0 prediction. In summary, our method facilitates accurate ET0 prediction, offering new insights for the development of agricultural irrigation and ecosystems, and further contributes to agricultural food supply.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods and agent-based models enable the optimization of the operation of high-capacity facilities. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically extracting and cleaning pedestrian traffic detector data for subsequent calibration of the ingress pedestrian model. The data was obtained from the waiting room traffic of a vaccination center. Walking speed distribution, the number of stops, the distribution of waiting times, and the locations of waiting points were extracted. Of the 9 machine learning algorithms, the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy in classifying valid data and noise. The proposed microscopic calibration allows for more accurate capacity assessment testing, procedural changes testing, and geometric modifications testing in parts of the facility adjacent to the calibrated parts. The results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a violent-flows dataset. The proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of input model predictions and optimize the operation of high-capacity facilities.",

    "title": "Detection of biomarkers using terahertz metasurface sensors and machine learning.",
    "abstract": "To achieve classification and concentration detection of cancer biomarkers, we propose a method that combines terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, metasurface sensors, and machine learning. A metasurface sensor suitable for biomarker detection was designed and fabricated with five resonance frequencies in the range of 0.3-0.9 THz. We collected biomarkers of five types and nine concentrations at 100 sets of time-domain spectra per concentration. The spectrum is processed by noise reduction and fast Fourier transform to obtain the frequency-domain spectrum. Five machine learning algorithms are used to analyze time- and frequency-domain spectra and ascertain which algorithm is more suitable for the classification of the biomarker THz spectrum. Experimental results show that random forest can better distinguish five biomarkers with an accuracy of 0.984 for the time-domain spectrum. For the frequency-domain spectrum, the support vector machine performs better, with an accuracy of 0.989. For biomarkers at different concentrations, we used linear regression to fit the relationship between biomarker concentration and frequency shift. Experimental results show that machine learning can distinguish different biomarker species and their concentrations by the THz spectrum. This work provides an idea and data processing method for the application of THz technology in biomedical detection.",

    "title": "HRV Features as Viable Physiological Markers for Stress Detection Using Wearable Devices.",
    "abstract": "Stress has been identified as one of the major causes of automobile crashes which then lead to high rates of fatalities and injuries each year. Stress can be measured via physiological measurements and in this study the focus will be based on the features that can be extracted by common wearable devices. Hence, the study will be mainly focusing on heart rate variability (HRV). This study is aimed at investigating the role of HRV-derived features as stress markers. This is achieved by developing a good predictive model that can accurately classify stress levels from ECG-derived HRV features, obtained from automobile drivers, by testing different machine learning methodologies such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB). Moreover, the models obtained with highest predictive power will be used as reference for the development of a machine learning model that would be used to classify stress from HRV features derived from heart rate measurements obtained from wearable devices. We demonstrate that HRV features constitute good markers for stress detection as the best machine learning model developed achieved a Recall of 80%. Furthermore, this study indicates that HRV metrics such as the Average of normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (AVNN), Standard deviation of the average NN intervals (SDNN) and the Root mean square differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD) were important features for stress detection. The proposed method can be also used on all applications in which is important to monitor the stress levels in a non-invasive manner, e.g., in physical rehabilitation, anxiety relief or mental wellbeing.",

We compare the GNN performance in the obvious runtime measurements, prediction accuracy, and analysis of outliers in the test set. Moreover, through TMAP clustering and statistical analysis, we are able to highlight clear hotspots of high prediction errors as well as optimal spectra prediction for molecules with certain functional groups.

Whilst the Gradient Boosting Classifier had the best performance in predicting dropout (sensitivity = 0.986), the Random Forest Classifier was the best at predicting non-dropout (specificity = 0.790); the overall performance of the Gradient Boosting Classifier was superior to the Random Forest Classifier (accuracy 0.955 against 0.920). The most relevant variables predicting dropout were \"non-attendance days\", \"total length of stay\", and \"total amount billed\". The use of decision trees provides information that can be readily acted upon to identify member profiles of those at risk of dropout, giving also guidelines for measures and policies to reduce it.",

    "title": "Obfuscation of Malicious Behaviors for Thwarting Masquerade Detection Systems Based on Locality Features.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, dynamic user verification has become one of the basic pillars for insider threat detection. From these threats, the research presented in this paper focuses on masquerader attacks, a category of insiders characterized by being intentionally conducted by persons outside the organization that somehow were able to impersonate legitimate users. Consequently, it is assumed that masqueraders are unaware of the protected environment within the targeted organization, so it is expected that they move in a more erratic manner than legitimate users along the compromised systems. This feature makes them susceptible to being discovered by dynamic user verification methods based on user profiling and anomaly-based intrusion detection. However, these approaches are susceptible to evasion through the imitation of the normal legitimate usage of the protected system (mimicry), which is being widely exploited by intruders. In order to contribute to their understanding, as well as anticipating their evolution, the conducted research focuses on the study of mimicry from the standpoint of an uncharted terrain: the masquerade detection based on analyzing locality traits. With this purpose, the problem is widely stated, and a pair of novel obfuscation methods are introduced: locality-based mimicry by action pruning and locality-based mimicry by noise generation. Their modus operandi, effectiveness, and impact are evaluated by a collection of well-known classifiers typically implemented for masquerade detection. The simplicity and effectiveness demonstrated suggest that they entail attack vectors that should be taken into consideration for the proper hardening of real organizations.",

However, the methods of determining the axial load capacity of the pile in the field are often costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid machine-learning to predict the axial load capacity of the pile. In particular, two powerful optimization algorithms named Herd Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were used to evolve the Random Forest (RF) model architecture. For the research, the data set including 472 results of pile load tests in Ha Nam province-Vietnam was used to build and test the machine-learning models. The data set was divided into training and testing parts with ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. Various performance indicators, namely absolute mean error (MAE), mean square root error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used to evaluate the performance of RF models. The results showed that, between the two optimization algorithms, GA gave superior performance compared to PSO in finding the best RF model architecture. In addition, the RF-GA model is also compared with the default RF model, the results show that the RF-GA model gives the best performance, with the balance on training and testing set, meaning avoiding the phenomenon of overfitting. The results of the study suggest a potential direction in the development of machine learning models in engineering in general and geotechnical engineering in particular.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of epileptic seizures from offline EEG signals is very important in clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Compared with manual labeling of EEG signals by doctors, machine learning approaches can be faster and more consistent. However, the classification accuracy is usually not satisfactory for two main reasons: the distributions of the data used for training and testing may be different, and the amount of training data may not be enough. In addition, most machine learning approaches generate black-box models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we integrate transductive transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and TSK fuzzy system to tackle these three problems. More specifically, we use transfer learning to reduce the discrepancy in data distribution between the training and testing data, employ semi-supervised learning to use the unlabeled testing data to remedy the shortage of training data, and adopt TSK fuzzy system to increase model interpretability. Two learning algorithms are proposed to train the system. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance than many state-of-the-art seizure classification algorithms.",

    "title": "Rethinking Copy-Paste for Consistency Learning in Medical Image Segmentation.",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning based on consistency learning offers significant promise for enhancing medical image segmentation. Current approaches use copy-paste as an effective data perturbation technique to facilitate weak-to-strong consistency learning. However, these techniques often lead to a decrease in the accuracy of synthetic labels corresponding to the synthetic data and introduce excessive perturbations to the distribution of the training data. Such over-perturbation causes the data distribution to stray from its true distribution, thereby impairing the model's generalization capabilities as it learns the decision boundaries. We propose a weak-to-strong consistency learning framework that integrally addresses these issues with two primary designs: 1) it emphasizes the use of highly reliable data to enhance the quality of labels in synthetic datasets through cross-copy-pasting between labeled and unlabeled datasets; 2) it employs uncertainty estimation and foreground region constraints to meticulously filter the regions for copy-pasting, thus the copy-paste technique implemented introduces a beneficial perturbation to the training data distribution. Our framework expands the copy-paste method by addressing its inherent limitations, and amplifying the potential of data perturbations for consistency learning. We extensively validated our model using six publicly available medical image segmentation datasets across different diagnostic tasks, including the segmentation of cardiac structures, prostate structures, brain structures, skin lesions, and gastrointestinal polyps. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. For instance, on the PROMISE12 dataset for the prostate structure segmentation task, using only 10% labeled data, our method achieves a 15.31% higher Dice score compared to the baseline models.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of recognizing human interactions with close physical contact from videos. Due to ambiguities in feature-to-person assignments and frequent occlusions in close interactions, it is difficult to accurately extract the interacting people. This degrades the recognition performance. We, therefore, propose a hierarchical model, which recognizes close interactions and infers supporting regions for each interacting individual simultaneously. Our model associates a set of hidden variables with spatiotemporal patches and discriminatively infers their states, which indicate the person that the patches belong to. This patch-aware representation explicitly models and accounts for discriminative supporting regions for individuals, and thus overcomes the problem of ambiguities in feature assignments. Moreover, we incorporate the prior for the patches to deal with frequent occlusions during interactions. Using the discriminative supporting regions, our model builds cleaner features for individual action recognition and interaction recognition. Extensive experiments are performed on the BIT-Interaction data set and the UT-Interaction data set set #1 and set #2, and validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

However, individual demographic and psychological variables, while replicating previous statistical findings, offer only negligible gains in accuracy. Successful predictions require previous ratings by the same rater, unless highly specific interactions between rater and joke content can be assessed.

The performance of a predictive machine learning model can be enhanced through the optimal selection of learning data, algorithm, algorithm parameters, and ensemble methods. In this article, we focus on how to enhance the prediction model using the learning data. However, get an option to add more and accurate data is not easy and available in many cases. This motivated us to propose the turbo prediction model, in which nearest neighbour structures are used to increase prediction accuracy. Five datasets, well known in the literature, were used in this article and experimental results show that turbo prediction can improve the quality prediction of the conventional prediction models, particularly for heterogeneous datasets, without any additional effort on the part of the user carrying out the prediction process, and at a minimal computational cost.",

Here, we propose a new method named energy auxiliary terms learning (EATL), in which the scoring components are extracted and used as the input for the development of three levels of ML SFs including EATL SFs, docking-EATL SFs and comprehensive SFs with ascending VS performance. The EATL approach not only outperforms classical SFs for the absolute performance (ROC) and initial enrichment (BEDROC) but also yields comparable performance compared with other advanced ML-based methods on the diverse subset of Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). The test on the relatively unbiased actives as decoys (AD) dataset also proved the effectiveness of EATL. Furthermore, the idea of learning from SF components to yield improved screening power can also be extended to other docking programs and SFs available.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of computing and technology has invaded all the dimensions of science. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one core branch of Computer Science, which has percolated to all the arenas of science and technology, from core engineering to medicines. Thus, AI has found its way for application in the field of medicinal chemistry and heath care. The conventional methods of drug design have been replaced by computer-aided designs of drugs in recent times. AI is being used extensively to improve the design techniques and required time of the drugs. Additionally, the target proteins can be conveniently identified using AI, which enhances the success rate of the designed drug. The AI technology is used in each step of the drug designing procedure, which decreases the health hazards related to preclinical trials and also reduces the cost substantially. The AI is an effective tool for data mining based on the huge pharmacological data and machine learning process. Hence, AI has been used in de novo drug design, activity scoring, virtual screening and in silico evaluation in the properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of a drug molecule. Various pharmaceutical companies have teamed up with AI companies for faster progress in the field of drug development, along with the healthcare system. The review covers various aspects of AI (Machine learning, Deep learning, Artificial neural networks) in drug design. It also provides a brief overview of the recent progress by the pharmaceutical companies in drug discovery by associating with different AI companies.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidant proteins can terminate a chain of reactions caused by free radicals and protect cells from damage. To identify antioxidant proteins rapidly, a computational model was proposed based on the optimized recoding scheme, sequence information and machine learning methods. First, over 600 recoding schemes were collected to build a scheme set. Then, the original sequence was recoded as a reduced expression whose g-gap dipeptides (g = 0, 1, 2) were used as the features of proteins. Furthermore, a random forest method was used to evaluate the classification ability of the obtained dipeptide features. After going through all schemes, the best predictive performance scheme was chosen as the optimized reduction scheme. Finally, for the RF method, a grid search strategy was used to select a better parameter combination to identify antioxidant proteins. In the experiment, the present method correctly recognized 90.13-99.87% of the antioxidant samples. Other experimental results also proved that the present method was efficient to identify antioxidant proteins. Finally, we also developed a web server that was freely accessible to researchers.",

    "abstract": "This proof of concept (PoC) assesses the ability of machine learning (ML) classifiers to predict the presence of a stenosis in a three vessel arterial system consisting of the abdominal aorta bifurcating into the two common iliacs. A virtual patient database (VPD) is created using one-dimensional pulse wave propagation model of haemodynamics. Four different machine learning (ML) methods are used to train and test a series of classifiers-both binary and multiclass-to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy virtual patients (VPs) using different combinations of pressure and flow-rate measurements. It is found that the ML classifiers achieve specificities larger than 80% and sensitivities ranging from 50 to 75%. The most balanced classifier also achieves an area under the receiver operative characteristic curve of 0.75, outperforming approximately 20 methods used in clinical practice, and thus placing the method as moderately accurate. Other important observations from this study are that (i) few measurements can provide similar classification accuracies compared to the case when more/all the measurements are used; (ii) some measurements are more informative than others for classification; and (iii) a modification of standard methods can result in detection of not only the presence of stenosis, but also the stenosed vessel.

    "abstract": "Backgroud: The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is of great significance in drug development. It is time-consuming and expensive in traditional experimental methods. Machine learning can reduce the cost of prediction and is limited by the characteristics of imbalanced datasets and problems of essential feature selection. The prediction method based on the Ensemble model of Multiple Feature Pairs (Ensemble-MFP) is introduced. Firstly, three negative sets are generated according to the Euclidean distance of three feature pairs. Then, the negative samples of the validation set/test set are randomly selected from the union set of the three negative sets in the validation set/test set. At the same time, the ensemble model with weight is optimized and applied to the test set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under ROC, AUC) in three out of four sub-datasets in gold standard datasets was more than 94.0% in the prediction of new drugs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also shown with the comparison of state-of-the-art methods and demonstration of predicted drug-target pairs. The Ensemble-MFP can weigh the existing feature pairs and has a good prediction effect for general prediction on new drugs.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained categorization is one of the most challenging problems in machine vision. Recently, the presented methods have been based on convolutional neural networks, increasing the accuracy of classification very significantly. Inspired by these methods, we offer a new framework for fine-grained categorization. Our tree method, named \"TMTCPT\", is based on the taxonomic categorization, phylogenetic tree, and convolutional neural network classifiers. The word \"taxonomic\" has been derived from \"taxonomical categorization\" that categorizes objects and visual features and performs a prominent role in this category. It presents a hierarchical categorization that leads to multiple classification levels; the first level includes the general visual features having the lowest similarity level, whereas the other levels include visual features strikingly similar, as they follow top-bottom hierarchy. The phylogenetic tree presents the phylogenetic information of organisms. The convolutional neural network classifiers can classify the categories precisely. In this study, the researchers created a tree to increase classification accuracy and evaluated the effectiveness of the method by examining it on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset. The study results demonstrated that the proposed method was efficient and robust. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method was 88.34%, being higher than those of all the previous methods.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform at reducing fax processing time and producing accurate machine learning inferences across the tasks of patient identification, document classification, spam classification, and duplicate document detection. We deployed coordn8 in 11 outpatient clinics and conducted a time savings analysis by observing users and measuring fax processing event logs. We used statistical methods to evaluate the machine learning components across different datasets to show generalizability. We conducted a time series analysis to show variations in model performance as new clinics were onboarded and to demonstrate our approach to mitigating model drift. Our observation analysis showed a mean reduction in individual fax processing time by 147.5 s, while our event log analysis of over 7000 faxes reinforced this finding. Document classification produced an accuracy of 81.6%, patient identification produced an accuracy of 83.7%, spam classification produced an accuracy of 98.4%, and duplicate document detection produced a precision of 81.0%. Retraining document classification increased accuracy by 10.2%. coordn8 significantly decreased fax-processing time and produced accurate machine learning inferences. Our human-in-the-loop framework facilitated the collection of high-quality data necessary for model training. Expanding to new clinics correlated with performance decline, which was mitigated through model retraining.

    "title": "Distilling Ordinal Relation and Dark Knowledge for Facial Age Estimation.",
    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a knowledge distillation approach with two teachers for facial age estimation. Due to the nonstationary patterns of the facial-aging process, the relative order of age labels provides more reliable information than exact age values for facial age estimation. Thus, the first teacher is a novel ranking method capturing the ordinal relation among age labels. Especially, it formulates the ordinal relation learning as a task of recovering the original ordered sequences from shuffled ones. The second teacher adopts the same model as the student that treats facial age estimation as a multiclass classification task. The proposed method leverages the intermediate representations learned by the first teacher and the softened outputs of the second teacher as supervisory signals to improve the training procedure and final performance of the compact student for facial age estimation. Hence, the proposed knowledge distillation approach is capable of distilling the ordinal knowledge from the ranking model and the dark knowledge from the multiclass classification model into a compact student, which facilitates the implementation of facial age estimation on platforms with limited memory and computation resources, such as mobile and embedded devices. Extensive experiments involving several famous data sets for age estimation have demonstrated the superior performance of our proposed method over several existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of immune and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is informative of levels of inflammation, angiogenesis, and desmoplasia. Radiomics, an approach of extracting quantitative features from radiological imaging to characterize diseases, have been shown to predict molecular classification, cancer recurrence risk, and many other disease outcomes. However, the ability of radiomics methods to predict the abundance of various cell types in the TME remains unclear. In this study, we employed a radio-genomics approach and machine learning models to predict the infiltration of 10 cell types in breast cancer lesions utilizing radiomic features extracted from breast Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We performed a retrospective study utilizing 73 patients from two independent institutions with imaging and gene expression data provided by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. A set of 199 radiomic features including shape-based, morphological, texture, and kinetic characteristics were extracted from the lesion volumes. To capture one-to-one relationships between radiomic features and cell type abundance, we performed linear regression on each radiomic feature/cell type abundance combination. Each regression model was tested for statistical significance. In addition, multivariate models were built for the cell type infiltration status (i.e. \"high\" vs \"low\") prediction. A feature selection process via Recursive Feature Elimination was applied to the radiomic features on the training set. The classification models took the form of a binary logistic extreme gradient boosting framework. Two evaluation methods including leave-one-out cross validation and external independent test, were used for radiomic model learning and testing. The models' performance was measured via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Univariate relationships were identified between a set of radiomic features and the abundance of fibroblasts. Multivariate models yielded leave-one-out cross validation AUCs ranging from 0.5 to 0.83, and independent test AUCs ranging from 0.5 to 0.68 for the multiple cell type invasion predictions. On two independent breast cancer cohorts, breast MRI-derived radiomics are associated with the tumor's microenvironment in terms of the abundance of several cell types. Further evaluation with larger cohorts is needed.",

    "abstract": "Many healthcare systems employ population-based risk scores to prospectively identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, but it is unclear whether single point-in-time scores adequately represent future risk. We sought to identify and characterize latent subgroups of high-risk patients based on risk score trajectories. Observational study of 7289 patients discharged from Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals during a 1-week period in November 2012 and categorized in the top 5th percentile of risk for hospitalization. Using VA administrative data, we calculated weekly risk scores using the validated Care Assessment Needs model, reflecting the predicted probability of hospitalization. We applied the non-parametric k-means algorithm to identify latent subgroups of patients based on the trajectory of patients' hospitalization probability over a 2-year period. We then compared baseline sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, health service use, and social instability markers between identified latent subgroups. The best-fitting model identified two subgroups: moderately high and persistently high risk. The moderately high subgroup included 65% of patients and was characterized by moderate subgroup-level hospitalization probability decreasing from 0.22 to 0.10 between weeks 1 and 66, then remaining constant through the study end. The persistently high subgroup, comprising the remaining 35% of patients, had a subgroup-level probability increasing from 0.38 to 0.41 between weeks 1 and 52, and declining to 0.30 at study end. Persistently high-risk patients were older, had higher prevalence of social instability and comorbidities, and used more health services. On average, one third of patients initially identified as high risk stayed at very high risk over a 2-year follow-up period, while risk for the other two thirds decreased to a moderately high level. This suggests that multiple approaches may be needed to address high-risk patient needs longitudinally or intermittently.",

A generalized model incorporating multiple frequency bands should be more efficient in associating potential EEG biomarkers with first-episode psychosis (FEP), leading to an accurate diagnosis. We explore multiple machine-learning methods, including random-forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process classifier (GPC), to demonstrate the practicality of resting-state power spectral density (PSD) to distinguish patients of FEP from healthy controls. A comprehensive discussion of our preprocessing methods for PSD analysis and a detailed comparison of different models are included in this paper. The GPC model outperforms the other models with a specificity of 95.78% to show that PSD can be used as an effective feature extraction technique for analyzing and classifying resting-state EEG signals of psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "In single-cell transcriptomics and other omics technologies, large fractions of missing values commonly occur. Researchers often either consider only those features that were measured for each instance of their dataset, thereby accepting severe loss of information, or use imputation which can lead to erroneous results. Pairwise metrics allow for imputation-free classification with minimal loss of data. Using pairwise correlations as metric, state-of-the-art approaches to classification would include the K-nearest-neighbor- (KNN) and distribution-based-classification-classifier. Our novel method, termed average correlations as features (ACF), significantly outperforms those approaches by training tunable machine learning models on inter-class and intra-class correlations. Our approach is characterized in simulation studies and its classification performance is demonstrated on real-world datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and bottom-up proteomics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variants of our method offer superior flexibility and performance over KNN classifiers and can be used in conjunction with other machine learning methods. In summary, ACF is a flexible method that enables missing value tolerant classification with minimal loss of data.",

Since relatively recently, graph neural network (GNN) algorithms have been implemented for molecular ML, showing comparable or superior performance to descriptor or fingerprint-based approaches. Although various tools and packages exist to apply GNNs in molecular ML, a new GNN package, named MolGraph, was developed in this work with the motivation to create GNN model pipelines highly compatible with the TensorFlow and Keras application programming interface (API). MolGraph also implements a module to accommodate the generation of small molecular graphs, which can be passed to a GNN algorithm to solve a molecular ML problem. To validate the GNNs, benchmarking was conducted using the datasets from MoleculeNet, as well as three chromatographic retention time datasets. The benchmarking results demonstrate that the GNNs performed in line with expectations. Additionally, the GNNs proved useful for molecular identification and improved interpretability of chromatographic retention time data. MolGraph is available at https://github.com/akensert/molgraph .

    "title": "A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Metastatic Cancer Detection.",
    "abstract": "Cancer has been found as a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes and aims to destroy the body's normal cells abruptly. As a result, it is essential to detect and prognosis the distinct type of cancer since they may help cancer survivors with treatment in the early stage. It must also divide cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups. While realizing efficient detection of cancer is frequently a time-taking and exhausting task with the high possibility of pathologist errors and previous studies employed data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify cancer, these strategies rely on handcrafted feature extraction techniques that result in incorrect classification. On the contrary, deep learning (DL) is robust in feature extraction and has recently been widely used for classification and detection purposes. This research implemented a novel hybrid AlexNet-gated recurrent unit (AlexNet-GRU) model for the lymph node (LN) breast cancer detection and classification. We have used a well-known Kaggle (PCam) data set to classify LN cancer samples. This study is tested and compared among three models: convolutional neural network GRU (CNN-GRU), CNN long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and the proposed AlexNet-GRU. The experimental results indicated that the performance metrics accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity (99.50%, 98.10%, 98.90%, and 97.50) of the proposed model can reduce the pathologist errors that occur during the diagnosis process of incorrect classification and significantly better performance than CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM models. The proposed model is compared with other recent ML/DL algorithms to analyze the model's efficiency, which reveals that the proposed AlexNet-GRU model is computationally efficient. Also, the proposed model presents its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for LN breast cancer detection and classification.",

    "title": "A class-incremental learning approach for learning feature-compatible embeddings.",
    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to constantly learn new knowledge. However, for artificial intelligence, trying to continuously learn new knowledge usually results in catastrophic forgetting, the existing regularization-based and dynamic structure-based approaches have shown great potential for alleviating. Nevertheless, these approaches have certain limitations. They usually do not fully consider the problem of incompatible feature embeddings. Instead, they tend to focus only on the features of new or previous classes and fail to comprehensively consider the entire model. Therefore, we propose a two-stage learning paradigm to solve feature embedding incompatibility problems. Specifically, we retain the previous model and freeze all its parameters in the first stage while dynamically expanding a new module to alleviate feature embedding incompatibility questions. In the second stage, a fusion knowledge distillation approach is used to compress the redundant feature dimensions. Moreover, we propose weight pruning and consolidation approaches to improve the efficiency of the model. Our experimental results obtained on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1000 benchmark datasets show that the proposed approaches achieve the best performance among all the compared approaches. For example, on the ImageNet-100 dataset, the maximal accuracy improvement is 5.08%. Code is available at https://github.com/ybyangjing/CIL-FCE.",

    "abstract": "There are several classes of short peptide molecules, known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced during the immune responses of living organisms against various infections. In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in applying machine-learning methods to predict the activities of AMPs against bacteria. In most investigated cases, however, the outcome is not bacterium-specific since the specific features of bacteria, such as chemical composition and structure of membranes, are not considered. To overcome this problem, we developed a new computational approach that allowed us to train several supervised machine-learning models using a specific set of data associated with peptides targeting bacteria. LASSO regression and Support Vector Machine techniques have been utilized to select, among more than 1500 physicochemical descriptors, the most important features that can be used to classify a peptide as antimicrobial or ineffective against . We then performed the classification of active versus inactive AMPs using the Support Vector classifiers, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest methods. This computational study allows us to make recommendations of how to design more efficient antibacterial drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "A low-cost machine learning (ML) algorithm is proposed and discussed for spatial tracking of unknown, correlated signals in localized, ad-hoc wireless sensor networks. Each sensor is modeled as one neuron and a selected subset of these neurons are called to identify the spatial signal. The algorithm is implemented in two phases of spatial modeling and spatial tracking. The spatial signal is modeled using its iso-contour lines at levels {ℓj}j=1M and those sensors that their sensor observations are in Δ margin of any of these levels report their sensor observations to the fusion center (FC) for spatial signal reconstruction. In spatial modeling phase, the number of these contour lines, their levels and a proper Δ are identified. In this phase, the algorithm may either use adaptive-weight stochastic gradient or scaled stochastic gradient method to select a proper Δ. Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean is assumed along with the sensor observations. To reduce the observation noise's effect, each sensor applies moving average filter on its observation to drastically reduce the effect of noise. The modeling performance, the cost and the convergence of the algorithm are discussed based on extensive computer simulations and reasoning. The algorithm is proposed for climate and environmental monitoring. In this paper, the percentage of wireless sensors that initiate a communication attempt is assumed as cost. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed spatial tracking approach is low-cost and can model the spatial signal over time with the same performance as that of spatial modeling.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia, eating disorders, heart problems and even strokes are just some of the illnesses that reveal the negative impact of stress overload on health and well-being. Early detection of stress is therefore of utmost importance. Whereas the gold-standard for detecting stress is by means of questionnaires, more recent work uses wearable sensors to find continuous and qualitative physical markers of stress. As some physiological stress responses, e.g. increased heart rate or sweating and chills, might also occur when doing sports, a more profound approach is needed for stress detection than purely considering physiological data. In this paper, we analyse the added value of context information during stress detection from wearable data. We do so by comparing the performance of models trained purely on physiological data and models trained on physiological and context data. We consider the user's activity and hours of sleep as context information, where we compare the influence of user-given context versus machine learning derived context. Context-aware models reach higher accuracy and lower standard deviations in comparison to the baseline (physiological) models. We also observe higher accuracy and improved weighted F1 score when incorporating machine learning predicted, instead of user-given, activities as context information. In this paper we show that considering context information when performing stress detection from wearables leads to better performance. We also show that it is possible to move away from human labeling and rely only on the wearables for both physiology and context.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression microarray classification is a crucial research field as it has been employed in cancer prediction and diagnosis systems. Gene expression data are composed of dozens of samples characterized by thousands of genes. Hence, an accurate and effective classification of such samples is a challenge. Machine learning techniques have been broadly utilized to build substantial and precise classification models. This paper proposes a new classification technique for gene expression data, which is called Modified k-nearest neighbor (MKNN). MKNN is applied in two scenarios namely; smallest modified KNN (SMKNN) and largest modified KNN (LMKNN). Both implementations are undertaken to enhance the performance of KNN. The key idea is to employ robust neighbors from training data by using a new weighting strategy. Several experiments have been performed on six different gene expression datasets. Experiments have shown that MKNN in its both scenarios outperforms traditional as well as recent ones. MKNN has been compared against (i) KNN, (ii) weighted KNN, (iii) support vector machine (SVM), (iv) fuzzy support vector machine, (v) brain emotional learning (BEL) in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall. On the other hand, results show that MKNN introduces smaller testing time than both KNN and weighted KNN.",

A systematic evaluation on the topic with subsequent discussion of the clinical variables involved is lacking. The purpose of this study was to systematically critique the digital methods and techniques used to deploy automated diagnostic tools in the clinical evaluation of altered functional and parafunctional occlusion. Articles were screened by 2 reviewers in mid-2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible articles were critically appraised by using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Diagnostic Test Accuracy (JBI-DTA) protocol and Minimum Information for Clinical Artificial Intelligence Modeling (MI-CLAIM) checklist. Sixteen articles were extracted. Variations in mandibular anatomic landmarks obtained via radiographs and photographs produced notable errors in prediction accuracy. While half of the studies adhered to robust methods of computer science, the lack of blinding to a reference standard and convenient exclusion of data in favor of accurate machine learning suggested that conventional diagnostic test methods were ineffective in regulating machine learning research in clinical occlusion. As preestablished baselines or criterion standards were lacking for model evaluation, a heavy reliance was placed on the validation provided by clinicians, often dental specialists, which was prone to subjective biases and largely governed by professional experience. Based on the findings and because of the numerous clinical variables and inconsistencies, the current literature on dental machine learning presented nondefinitive but promising results in diagnosing functional and parafunctional occlusal parameters.",

Fall protection systems (FPS) are critical for preventing falls in the work-at-height (WAH) environment. However, challenges in designing and selecting effective FPS persist across various industries, and existing tools often lack practical references. This study aims to develop an FFH-specific knowledge graph (FFH-KG) to support FPS design. By structuring accident data, the FFH-KG provides empirical insights to help designers improve FPS frameworks, aiding safety planning and decision-making. It serves as a decision support system for FPS designers and safety professionals, guiding the selection and design of appropriate protection solutions for diverse WAH scenarios. The FFH-KG was constructed using a hybrid natural language processing approach, combining manual extraction, entity recognition, text segmentation, and rule-based relation extraction. It was grounded in a schema layer (i.e., ontology) established by experts. A text-mining approach, integrating machine learning with a large language model, facilitated the categorization of fall types, refinement of WAH scenarios, and identification of fall causes, enhancing the content and applicability of knowledge graph. A total of 2,200 entities and 4,820 relationships were created based on fall protection equipment standard documents and fall-from-height accident investigation reports, forming a foundation for developing countermeasures. The retrieval performance of FFH-KG was validated through three case studies. This research has also made significant progress in intelligent safety engineering and management across industries.",

    "title": "Deep Learning-Assisted Gait Parameter Assessment for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Model Development and Validation.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are prevalent among older adults worldwide. Early diagnosis of NDD is challenging yet crucial. Gait status has been identified as an indicator of early-stage NDD changes and can play a significant role in diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Historically, gait assessment has relied on intricate but imprecise scales by trained professionals or required patients to wear additional equipment, causing discomfort. Advancements in artificial intelligence may completely transform this and offer a novel approach to gait evaluation. This study aimed to use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to offer patients a noninvasive, entirely contactless gait assessment and provide health care professionals with precise gait assessment results covering all common gait-related parameters to assist in diagnosis and rehabilitation planning. Data collection involved motion data from 41 different participants aged 25 to 85 (mean 57.51, SD 12.93) years captured in motion sequences using the Azure Kinect (Microsoft Corp; a 3D camera with a 30-Hz sampling frequency). Support vector machine (SVM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) classifiers trained using spatiotemporal features extracted from raw data were used to identify gait types in each walking frame. Gait semantics could then be obtained from the frame labels, and all the gait parameters could be calculated accordingly. For optimal generalization performance of the model, the classifiers were trained using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed algorithm was also compared with the previous best heuristic method. Qualitative and quantitative feedback from medical staff and patients in actual medical scenarios was extensively collected for usability analysis. The evaluations comprised 3 aspects. Regarding the classification results from the 2 classifiers, Bi-LSTM achieved an average precision, recall, and F -score of 90.54%, 90.41%, and 90.38%, respectively, whereas these metrics were 86.99%, 86.62%, and 86.67%, respectively, for SVM. Moreover, the Bi-LSTM-based method attained 93.2% accuracy in gait segmentation evaluation (tolerance set to 2), whereas that of the SVM-based method achieved only 77.5% accuracy. For the final gait parameter calculation result, the average error rate of the heuristic method, SVM, and Bi-LSTM was 20.91% (SD 24.69%), 5.85% (SD 5.45%), and 3.17% (SD 2.75%), respectively. This study demonstrated that the Bi-LSTM-based approach can effectively support accurate gait parameter assessment, assisting medical professionals in making early diagnoses and reasonable rehabilitation plans for patients with NDD.",

    "title": "Solving visual pollution with deep learning: A new nexus in environmental management.",
    "abstract": "Visual pollution is a relatively new concern amidst the existing plethora of mainstream environmental pollution, recommending the necessity for research to conceptualize, formalize, quantify and assess it from different dimensions. The purpose of this study is to create a new field of automated visual pollutant classification, harnessing the technological prowess of the 21 century for applications in environmental management. From the wide range of visual pollutants, four categories have been considered viz. (i) billboards and signage, (ii) telephone and communication wires, (iii) network and communication towers and (iv) street litter. The deep learning model used in this study simulates the human learning experience in the context of image recognition for visual pollutant classification by training and testing a convolutional neural network with several layers of artificial neurons. Data augmentation using image processing techniques and a train-test split ratio of 80:20 have been used. Training accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy of 85% have been achieved by the deep learning model. The results indicate that the upper limit of accuracy i.e. the asymptote, depends on the dataset size for this type of task. This study has several applications in environmental management. For example, the deployment of the trained model for processing of video/live footage from smartphone applications, closed-circuit television and drones/unmanned aerial vehicles can be applied for both the removal and management of visual pollutants in the natural and built environment. Furthermore, generating the 'visual pollution score/index' of urban regions such as towns and cities will create a new 'metric/indicator' in the field of urban environmental management.",

    "abstract": "Materials properties depend not only on their compositions but also their microstructures under various processing conditions. So far, the analyses of complex microstructure images rely mostly on human experience, lack of automatic quantitative characterization methods. Machine learning provides an emerging vital tool to identify various complex materials phases in an intelligent manner. In this work, we propose a \"center-environment segmentation\" (CES) feature model for image segmentation based on machine learning method with environment features and the annotation input of domain knowledge. The CES model introduces the information of neighbourhood as the features of a given pixel, reflecting the relationships between the studied pixel and its surrounding environment. Then, an iterative integrated machine learning method is adopted to train and correct the image segmentation model. The CES model was successfully applied to segment seven different material images with complex texture ranging from steels to woods. The overall performance of the CES method in determining boundary contours is better than many conventional methods in the case study of the segmentation of steel image. This work shows that the iterative introduction of domain knowledge and environment features improve the accuracy of machine learning based image segmentation for various complex materials microstructures.",

    "title": "Lesion-Harvester: Iteratively Mining Unlabeled Lesions and Hard-Negative Examples at Scale.",
    "abstract": "The acquisition of large-scale medical image data, necessary for training machine learning algorithms, is hampered by associated expert-driven annotation costs. Mining hospital archives can address this problem, but labels often incomplete or noisy, e.g., 50% of the lesions in DeepLesion are left unlabeled. Thus, effective label harvesting methods are critical. This is the goal of our work, where we introduce Lesion-Harvester-a powerful system to harvest missing annotations from lesion datasets at high precision. Accepting the need for some degree of expert labor, we use a small fully-labeled image subset to intelligently mine annotations from the remainder. To do this, we chain together a highly sensitive lesion proposal generator (LPG) and a very selective lesion proposal classifier (LPC). Using a new hard negative suppression loss, the resulting harvested and hard-negative proposals are then employed to iteratively finetune our LPG. While our framework is generic, we optimize our performance by proposing a new 3D contextual LPG and by using a global-local multi-view LPC. Experiments on DeepLesion demonstrate that Lesion-Harvester can discover an additional 9,805 lesions at a precision of 90%. We publicly release the harvested lesions, along with a new test set of completely annotated DeepLesion volumes. We also present a pseudo 3D IoU evaluation metric that corresponds much better to the real 3D IoU than current DeepLesion evaluation metrics. To quantify the downstream benefits of Lesion-Harvester we show that augmenting the DeepLesion annotations with our harvested lesions allows state-of-the-art detectors to boost their average precision by 7 to 10%.",

    "title": "Predicting Antimalarial Activity in Natural Products Using Pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.",
    "abstract": "Malaria is a threatening disease that has claimed many lives and has a high prevalence rate annually. Through the past decade, there have been many studies to uncover effective antimalarial compounds to combat this disease. Alongside chemically synthesized chemicals, a number of natural compounds have also been proven to be as effective in their antimalarial properties. Besides experimental approaches to investigate antimalarial activities in natural products, computational methods have been developed with satisfactory outcomes obtained. In this study, we propose a novel molecular encoding scheme based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and used our pretrained encoding model called NPBERT with four machine learning algorithms, including -Nearest Neighbors ( -NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Random Forest (RF), to develop various prediction models to identify antimalarial natural products. The results show that SVM models are the best-performing classifiers, followed by the XGB, -NN, and RF models. Additionally, comparative analysis between our proposed molecular encoding scheme and existing state-of-the-art methods indicates that NPBERT is more effective compared to the others. Moreover, the deployment of transformers in constructing molecular encoders is not limited to this study but can be utilized for other biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Digital transformation has sparked profound change in the healthcare sector through the development of innovative digital technologies. Digital Therapeutics offer an innovative approach to disease management and treatment. Care delivery is increasingly patient-centered, data-driven, and based on real-time information. These technological innovations can lead to better patient outcomes and support for healthcare professionals, also considering resource scarcity. As these digital technologies continue to evolve, the healthcare field must be ready to integrate them into processes to take advantage of their benefits. This study aims to develop a framework for the development and assessment of Digital Therapeutics. The study was conducted relying on a mixed methodology. 338 studies about Digital Therapeutics resulting from a systematic literature review were analyzed using descriptive statistics through RStudio. Machine learning algorithms were applied to analyze variables and find patterns in the data. The results of these analytical analyses were summarized in a framework qualitatively tested and validated through expert opinion elicitation. The research provides M-LEAD, a Machine Learning-Enhanced Assessment and Development framework that recommends best practices for developing and assessing Digital Therapeutics. The framework takes as input Digital Therapeutics characteristics, regulatory aspects, study purpose, and assessment domains. The framework produces as outputs recommendations to design the Digital Therapeutics study characteristics. The framework constitutes the first step toward standardized guidelines for the development and assessment of Digital Therapeutics. The results may support manufacturers and inform decision-makers of the relevant results of the Digital Therapeutics assessment.",

Although these models achieve state-of-the-art performance for many language related tasks, their applicability outside of the natural language processing field has been minimal. In this work, we propose the use of transformer models for the prediction of dynamical systems representative of physical phenomena. The use of Koopman based embeddings provides a unique and powerful method for projecting any dynamical system into a vector representation which can then be predicted by a transformer. The proposed model is able to accurately predict various dynamical systems and outperform classical methods that are commonly used in the scientific machine learning literature. .",

    "abstract": "Clinical medicine offers a promising arena for applying Machine Learning (ML) models. However, despite numerous studies employing ML in medical data analysis, only a fraction have impacted clinical care. This article underscores the importance of utilising ML in medical data analysis, recognising that ML alone may not adequately capture the full complexity of clinical data, thereby advocating for the integration of medical domain knowledge in ML. The study conducts a comprehensive review of prior efforts in integrating medical knowledge into ML and maps these integration strategies onto the phases of the ML pipeline, encompassing data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, and output evaluation. The study further explores the significance and impact of such integration through a case study on diabetes prediction. Here, clinical knowledge, encompassing rules, causal networks, intervals, and formulas, is integrated at each stage of the ML pipeline, resulting in a spectrum of integrated models. The findings highlight the benefits of integration in terms of accuracy, interpretability, data efficiency, and adherence to clinical guidelines. In several cases, integrated models outperformed purely data-driven approaches, underscoring the potential for domain knowledge to enhance ML models through improved generalisation. In other cases, the integration was instrumental in enhancing model interpretability and ensuring conformity with established clinical guidelines. Notably, knowledge integration also proved effective in maintaining performance under limited data scenarios. By illustrating various integration strategies through a clinical case study, this work provides guidance to inspire and facilitate future integration efforts. Furthermore, the study identifies the need to refine domain knowledge representation and fine-tune its contribution to the ML model as the two main challenges to integration and aims to stimulate further research in this direction.",

Incremental updating of parameters based on pre-trained networks can flexibly respond to user requirements and enhance user-centered interfaces. However, updating the parameters of a pre-trained network with new class data can easily lead to catastrophic forgetting. While mitigating the phenomenon by straightforwardly replaying historical data, this approach necessitates significant memory resources, a constraint that proves often impractical in real-world applications where access to historical data is limited. To avoid this limitation and incrementally add new classes to the pre-trained network, we proposed a deep generative replay-based continual learning (CL) framework. The performance was evaluated using a public sEMG dataset under two-class-incremental learning scenario until four tasks. As a result, the proposed framework performed better than other conventional CL methods except for experience replay, which simply reuses historical data.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical relation classification has been significantly improved by the application of advanced machine learning techniques on the raw texts of scholarly publications. Despite this improvement, the reliance on large chunks of raw text makes these algorithms suffer in terms of generalization, precision, and reliability. The use of the distinctive characteristics of bibliographic metadata can prove effective in achieving better performance for this challenging task. In this research paper, we introduce an approach for biomedical relation classification using the qualifiers of co-occurring Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). First of all, we introduce MeSH2Matrix, our dataset consisting of 46,469 biomedical relations curated from PubMed publications using our approach. Our dataset includes a matrix that maps associations between the qualifiers of subject MeSH keywords and those of object MeSH keywords. It also specifies the corresponding Wikidata relation type and the superclass of semantic relations for each relation. Using MeSH2Matrix, we build and train three machine learning models (Support Vector Machine [SVM], a dense model [D-Model], and a convolutional neural network [C-Net]) to evaluate the efficiency of our approach for biomedical relation classification. Our best model achieves an accuracy of 70.78% for 195 classes and 83.09% for five superclasses. Finally, we provide confusion matrix and extensive feature analyses to better examine the relationship between the MeSH qualifiers and the biomedical relations being classified. Our results will hopefully shed light on developing better algorithms for biomedical ontology classification based on the MeSH keywords of PubMed publications. For reproducibility purposes, MeSH2Matrix, as well as all our source codes, are made publicly accessible at https://github.com/SisonkeBiotik-Africa/MeSH2Matrix .",

This study utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to investigate the intricate interplay between urban socioeconomic growth and O levels. Surpassing traditional environmental chemistry, it assesses the effectiveness of these algorithms in interpreting socioeconomic and environmental data, while elucidating urban development's environmental impacts from a novel socioeconomic perspective. Key findings indicate that factors such as urban infrastructure, industrial activities, and demographic dynamics significantly influence O pollution. The study highlights the particular sensitivity of urban public transportation and population density, each exerting a unique and substantial effect on O levels. Additionally, the research identifies nuanced interactions among these factors, indicating a complex web of influences on urban O pollution. These interactions suggest that the impact of individual socioeconomic elements on O pollution is interdependent, being either amplified or mitigated by other factors. The study emphasizes the crucial need to integrate socioeconomic variables into urban O pollution strategies, advocating for policies tailored to each city's distinct characteristics, informed by the detailed analysis provided by machine learning. This approach is essential for developing effective and nuanced urban pollution management strategies.",

    "abstract": "To understand the variation in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) adoption across different hospital characteristics and explore how AI/ML is utilized, particularly in relation to neighborhood deprivation. AI/ML-assisted care coordination has the potential to reduce health disparities, but there is a lack of empirical evidence on AI's impact on health equity. We used linked datasets from the 2022 American Hospital Association Annual Survey and the 2023 American Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement. The data were further linked to the 2022 Area Deprivation Index (ADI) for each hospital's service area. State fixed-effect regressions were employed. A decomposition model was also used to quantify predictors of AI/ML implementation, comparing hospitals in higher versus lower ADI areas. Hospitals serving the most vulnerable areas (ADI Q4) were significantly less likely to apply ML or other predictive models (coef = -0.10, P = 0.01) and provided fewer AI/ML-related workforce applications (coef = -0.40, P = 0.01), compared with those in the least vulnerable areas. Decomposition results showed that our model specifications explained 79% of the variation in AI/ML adoption between hospitals in ADI Q4 versus ADI Q1-Q3. In addition, Accountable Care Organization affiliation accounted for 12%-25% of differences in AI/ML utilization across various measures. The underuse of AI/ML in economically disadvantaged and rural areas, particularly in workforce management and electronic health record implementation, suggests that these communities may not fully benefit from advancements in AI-enabled health care. Our results further indicate that value-based payment models could be strategically used to support AI integration.",

    "abstract": "Late recurrence of atrial fibrillation (LRAF) in the first year following catheter ablation is a common and significant clinical problem. Our study aimed to create a machine-learning model for predicting arrhythmic recurrence within the first year since catheter ablation. The study comprised 201 consecutive patients (age: 61.8 ± 8.1; women 36%) with paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent cryoballoon (61%) and radiofrequency ablation (39%). Five different supervised machine-learning models (decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, support vector machines) were developed for predicting AF recurrence. Further, SHapley Additive exPlanations were derived to explain the predictions using 82 parameters based on clinical, laboratory, and procedural variables collected from each patient. The models were trained and validated using a stratified fivefold cross-validation, and a feature selection was performed with permutation importance. The XGBoost model with 12 variables showed the best performance on the testing cohort, with the highest AUC of 0.75 [95% confidence interval 0.7395, 0.7653]. The machine-learned model, based on the easily available 12 clinical and laboratory variables, predicted LRAF with good performance, which may provide a valuable tool in clinical practice for better patient selection and personalized AF strategy following the procedure.",

    "title": "Fatigue Evaluation through Machine Learning and a Global Fatigue Descriptor.",
    "abstract": "Research in physiology and sports science has shown that fatigue, a complex psychophysiological phenomenon, has a relevant impact in performance and in the correct functioning of our motricity system, potentially being a cause of damage to the human organism. Fatigue can be seen as a subjective or objective phenomenon. Subjective fatigue corresponds to a mental and cognitive event, while fatigue referred as objective is a physical phenomenon. Despite the fact that subjective fatigue is often undervalued, only a physically and mentally healthy athlete is able to achieve top performance in a discipline. Therefore, we argue that physical training programs should address the preventive assessment of both subjective and objective fatigue mechanisms in order to minimize the risk of injuries. In this context, our paper presents a machine-learning system capable of extracting individual fatigue descriptors (IFDs) from electromyographic (EMG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. Our novel approach, using two types of biosignals so that a global (mental and physical) fatigue assessment is taken into account, reflects the onset of fatigue by implementing a combination of a dimensionless (0-1) global fatigue descriptor (GFD) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The system, based on 9 main combined features, achieves fatigue regime classification performances of 0.82 ± 0.24, ensuring a successful preventive assessment when dangerous fatigue levels are reached. Training data were acquired in a constant work rate test (executed by 14 subjects using a cycloergometry device), where the variable under study (fatigue) gradually increased until the volunteer reached an objective exhaustion state.",

    "title": "Semi-Supervised Multimodal Representation Learning Through a Global Workspace.",
    "abstract": "Recent deep learning models can efficiently combine inputs from different modalities (e.g., images and text) and learn to align their latent representations or to translate signals from one domain to another (as in image captioning or text-to-image generation). However, current approaches mainly rely on brute-force supervised training over large multimodal datasets. In contrast, humans (and other animals) can learn useful multimodal representations from only sparse experience with matched cross-modal data. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of a neural network architecture inspired by the cognitive notion of a \"global workspace\" (GW): a shared representation for two (or more) input modalities. Each modality is processed by a specialized system (pretrained on unimodal data and subsequently frozen). The corresponding latent representations are then encoded to and decoded from a single shared workspace. Importantly, this architecture is amenable to self-supervised training via cycle-consistency: encoding-decoding sequences should approximate the identity function. For various pairings of vision-language modalities and across two datasets of varying complexity, we show that such an architecture can be trained to align and translate between two modalities with very little need for matched data (from four to seven times less than a fully supervised approach). The GW representation can be used advantageously for downstream classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks and for robust transfer learning. Ablation studies reveal that both the shared workspace and the self-supervised cycle-consistency training are critical to the system's performance.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of machine learning (ML), researchers have applied ML techniques to visualizations to achieve a better design, development, and evaluation of visualizations. This branch of studies, known as ML4VIS, is gaining increasing research attention in recent years. To successfully adapt ML techniques for visualizations, a structured understanding of the integration of ML4VIS is needed. In this article, we systematically survey 88 ML4VIS studies, aiming to answer two motivating questions: \"what visualization processes can be assisted by ML?\" and \"how ML techniques can be used to solve visualization problems? \"This survey reveals seven main processes where the employment of ML techniques can benefit visualizations: Data Processing4VIS, Data-VIS Mapping, Insight Communication, Style Imitation, VIS Interaction, VIS Reading, and User Profiling. The seven processes are related to existing visualization theoretical models in an ML4VIS pipeline, aiming to illuminate the role of ML-assisted visualization in general visualizations. Meanwhile, the seven processes are mapped into main learning tasks in ML to align the capabilities of ML with the needs in visualization. Current practices and future opportunities of ML4VIS are discussed in the context of the ML4VIS pipeline and the ML-VIS mapping. While more studies are still needed in the area of ML4VIS, we hope this article can provide a stepping-stone for future exploration.

    "title": "Neural Schrödinger Equation: Physical Law as Deep Neural Network.",
    "abstract": "We show a new family of neural networks based on the Schrödinger equation (SE-NET). In this analogy, the trainable weights of the neural networks correspond to the physical quantities of the Schrödinger equation. These physical quantities can be trained using the complex-valued adjoint method. Since the propagation of the SE-NET can be described by the evolution of physical systems, its outputs can be computed by using a physical solver. The trained network is transferable to actual optical systems. As a demonstration, we implemented the SE-NET with the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method on Pytorch. From the results of numerical simulations, we found that the performance of the SE-NET becomes better when the SE-NET becomes wider and deeper. However, the training of the SE-NET was unstable due to gradient explosions when SE-NET becomes deeper. Therefore, we also introduced phase-only training, which only updates the phase of the potential field (refractive index) in the Schrödinger equation. This enables stable training even for the deep SE-NET model because the unitarity of the system is kept under the training. In addition, the SE-NET enables a joint optimization of physical structures and digital neural networks. As a demonstration, we performed a numerical demonstration of end-to-end machine learning (ML) with an optical frontend toward a compact spectrometer. Our results extend the application field of ML to hybrid physical-digital optimizations.",

Several case studies have also reported that it is feasible to use the domain decomposition approach for the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to solve PDEs. In this study, we devised a pretraining scheme called smoothing with a basis reconstruction process on the structure of ANNs and then implemented the classic concept of DDM. The pretraining process that is engaged at the beginning of the training epochs can make the approximation basis become well-posed on the domain so that the quality of the estimated solution is enhanced. We report that such a well-organized pretraining scheme may affect any NN-based PDE solvers as we can speed up the approximation, improve the solution's smoothness, and so on. Numerical experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DDM method on ANN for estimating solutions of PDEs. Results revealed that this method could be used as a tool for tasks in general machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Computational predictions of the thermodynamic properties of molecules and materials play a central role in contemporary reaction prediction and kinetic modeling. Due to the lack of experimental data and computational cost of high-level quantum chemistry methods, approximate methods based on additivity schemes and more recently machine learning are currently the only approaches capable of supplying the chemical coverage and throughput necessary for such applications. For both approaches, ring-containing molecules pose a challenge to transferability due to the nonlocal interactions associated with conjugation and strain that significantly impact thermodynamic properties. Here, we report the development of a self-consistent approach for parameterizing transferable ring corrections based on high-level quantum chemistry. The method is benchmarked against both the Pedley-Naylor-Kline experimental dataset for C-, H-, O-, N-, S-, and halogen-containing cyclic molecules and a dataset of Gaussian-4 quantum chemistry calculations. The prescribed approach is demonstrated to be superior to existing ring corrections while maintaining extensibility to arbitrary chemistries. We have also compared this ring-correction scheme against a novel machine learning approach and demonstrate that the latter is capable of exceeding the performance of physics-based ring corrections.",

    "title": "Machine learning approaches classify clinical malaria outcomes based on haematological parameters.",
    "abstract": "Malaria is still a major global health burden, with more than 3.2 billion people in 91 countries remaining at risk of the disease. Accurately distinguishing malaria from other diseases, especially uncomplicated malaria (UM) from non-malarial infections (nMI), remains a challenge. Furthermore, the success of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is threatened by Pfhrp2/3 deletions and decreased sensitivity at low parasitaemia. Analysis of haematological indices can be used to support the identification of possible malaria cases for further diagnosis, especially in travellers returning from endemic areas. As a new application for precision medicine, we aimed to evaluate machine learning (ML) approaches that can accurately classify nMI, UM, and severe malaria (SM) using haematological parameters. We obtained haematological data from 2,207 participants collected in Ghana: nMI (n = 978), SM (n = 526), and UM (n = 703). Six different ML approaches were tested, to select the best approach. An artificial neural network (ANN) with three hidden layers was used for multi-classification of UM, SM, and uMI. Binary classifiers were developed to further identify the parameters that can distinguish UM or SM from nMI. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to explain the binary classifiers. The multi-classification model had greater than 85% training and testing accuracy to distinguish clinical malaria from nMI. To distinguish UM from nMI, our approach identified platelet counts, red blood cell (RBC) counts, lymphocyte counts, and percentages as the top classifiers of UM with 0.801 test accuracy (AUC = 0.866 and F1 score = 0.747). To distinguish SM from nMI, the classifier had a test accuracy of 0.96 (AUC = 0.983 and F1 score = 0.944) with mean platelet volume and mean cell volume being the unique classifiers of SM. Random forest was used to confirm the classifications, and it showed that platelet and RBC counts were the major classifiers of UM, regardless of possible confounders such as patient age and sampling location. The study provides proof of concept methods that classify UM and SM from nMI, showing that the ML approach is a feasible tool for clinical decision support. In the future, ML approaches could be incorporated into clinical decision-support algorithms for the diagnosis of acute febrile illness and monitoring response to acute SM treatment particularly in endemic settings.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods are commonly used for predicting molecular properties to accelerate material and drug design. An important part of this process is deciding how to represent the molecules. Typically, machine learning methods expect examples represented by vectors of values, and many methods for calculating molecular feature representations have been proposed. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparison of different molecular features, including traditional methods such as fingerprints and molecular descriptors, and recently proposed learnable representations based on neural networks. Feature representations are evaluated on 11 benchmark datasets, used for predicting properties and measures such as mutagenicity, melting points, activity, solubility, and IC50. Our experiments show that several molecular features work similarly well over all benchmark datasets. The ones that stand out most are Spectrophores, which give significantly worse performance than other features on most datasets. Molecular descriptors from the PaDEL library seem very well suited for predicting physical properties of molecules. Despite their simplicity, MACCS fingerprints performed very well overall. The results show that learnable representations achieve competitive performance compared to expert based representations. However, task-specific representations (graph convolutions and Weave methods) rarely offer any benefits, even though they are computationally more demanding. Lastly, combining different molecular feature representations typically does not give a noticeable improvement in performance compared to individual feature representations.",

Precise identification of the hotspot residues for protein-DNA interactions holds great significance for revealing the intricate mechanisms in protein-DNA recognition and for providing essential guidance for protein engineering. Aiming at protein-DNA interaction hotspots, this work introduces an effective prediction method, ESPDHot based on a stacked ensemble machine learning framework. Here, the interface residue whose mutation leads to a binding free energy change (ΔΔ ) exceeding 2 kcal/mol is defined as a hotspot. To tackle the imbalanced data set issue, the adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), an oversampling technique, is adopted to synthetically generate new minority samples, thereby rectifying data imbalance. As for molecular characteristics, besides traditional features, we introduce three new characteristic types including residue interface preference proposed by us, residue fluctuation dynamics characteristics, and coevolutionary features. Combining the Boruta method with our previously developed Random Grouping strategy, we obtained an optimal set of features. Finally, a stacking classifier is constructed to output prediction results, which integrates three classical predictors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the first layer, and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm as the second one. Notably, ESPDHot outperforms the current state-of-the-art predictors, achieving superior performance on the independent test data set, with F1, MCC, and AUC reaching 0.571, 0.516, and 0.870, respectively.",

    "title": "Unsupervised machine learning analysis to identify patterns of ICU medication use for fluid overload prediction.",
    "abstract": "Fluid overload (FO) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is common, serious, and may be preventable. Intravenous medications (including administered volume) are a primary cause for FO but are challenging to evaluate as a FO predictor given the high frequency and time-dependency of their use and other factors affecting FO. We sought to employ unsupervised machine learning methods to uncover medication administration patterns correlating with FO. This retrospective cohort study included 927 adults admitted to an ICU for ≥72 h. FO was defined as a positive fluid balance ≥7% of admission body weight. After reviewing medication administration record data in 3-h periods, medication exposure was categorized into clusters using principal component analysis (PCA) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Medication regimens of patients with and without FO were compared within clusters to assess their temporal association with FO. FO occurred in 127 (13.7%) of 927 included patients. Patients received a median (interquartile range) of 31(13-65) discrete intravenous medication administrations over the 72-h period. Across all 47,803 intravenous medication administrations, 10 unique medication clusters, containing 121 to 130 medications per cluster, were identified. The mean number of Cluster 7 medications administered was significantly greater in the FO cohort compared with patients without FO (25.6 vs.10.9, p < 0.0001). A total of 51 (40.2%) of 127 unique Cluster 7 medications were administered in more than five different 3-h periods during the 72-h study window. The most common Cluster 7 medications included continuous infusions, antibiotics, and sedatives/analgesics. Addition of Cluster 7 medications to an FO prediction model including the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and receipt of diuretics improved model predictiveness from an Area Under the Receiver Operation Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.719 to 0.741 (p = 0.027). Using machine learning approaches, a unique medication cluster was strongly associated with FO. Incorporation of this cluster improved the ability to predict FO compared to traditional prediction models. Integration of this approach into real-time clinical applications may improve early detection of FO to facilitate timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "Anti-CRISPR proteins are potent modulators that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas immunity system and have huge potential in gene editing and gene therapy as a genome-editing tool. Extensive studies have shown that anti-CRISPR proteins are essential for modifying endogenous genes, promoting the RNA-guided binding and cleavage of DNA or RNA substrates. In recent years, identifying and characterizing anti-CRISPR proteins has become a hot and significant research topic in bioinformatics. However, as most anti-CRISPR proteins fall short in sharing similarities to those currently known, traditional screening methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Machine learning methods could fill this gap with powerful predictive capability and provide a new perspective for anti-CRISPR protein identification. Here, we present a novel machine learning ensemble predictor, called PreAcrs, to identify anti-CRISPR proteins from protein sequences directly. Three features and eight different machine learning algorithms were used to train PreAcrs. PreAcrs outperformed other existing methods and significantly improved the prediction accuracy for identifying anti-CRISPR proteins. In summary, the PreAcrs predictor achieved a competitive performance for predicting new anti-CRISPR proteins in terms of accuracy and robustness. We anticipate PreAcrs will be a valuable tool for researchers to speed up the research process. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Lyn-666/anti_CRISPR.git .",

    "title": "Using machine learning tools to investigate factors associated with trends in 'no-shows' in outpatient appointments.",
    "abstract": "Missed appointments are estimated to cost the UK National Health Service (NHS) approximately £1 billion annually. Research that leads to a fuller understanding of the types of factors influencing spatial and temporal patterns of these so-called \"Did-Not-Attends\" (DNAs) is therefore timely. This research articulates the results of a study that uses machine learning approaches to investigate whether these factors are consistent across a range of medical specialities. A predictive model was used to determine the risk-increasing and risk-mitigating factors associated with missing appointments, which were then used to assign a risk score to patients on an appointment-by-appointment basis for each speciality. Results show that the best predictors of DNAs include the patient's age, appointment history, and the deprivation rank of their area of residence. Findings have been analysed at both a geographical and medical speciality level, and the factors associated with DNAs have been shown to differ in terms of both importance and association. This research has demonstrated how machine learning techniques have real value in informing future intervention policies related to DNAs that can help reduce the burden on the NHS and improve patient care and well-being.",

    "title": "Can big data policy drive urban carbon unlocking efficiency? A new approach based on double machine learning.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, data has increasingly become the \"new oil\" for 21st-century economic development. However, there is still a gap in how the development of big data promotes the improvement of urban carbon unlocking efficiency (UCUE). Utilizing advanced double machine learning (DML) methods, and treating the big data comprehensive pilot zone (BDCPZ) as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ panel data from 282 Chinese cities spanning 2011 to 2022 to study the impact of big data policies on UCUE and its mechanisms. The study finds that: (1) Big data policies significantly enhance carbon unlocking efficiency, and their importance in carbon unlocking is confirmed even when alternative machine learning models are used.(2) Regarding the mechanisms, big data policies improve carbon unlocking efficiency through three pathways: government modernization, enterprise intelligent development, and economic transformation.(3) Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the carbon unlocking benefits of big data policies are more pronounced in large cities, old industrial base cities, digital economy dividend cities and key environmental protection cities. We also provide insights for strengthening the construction of big data, alleviating carbon emission pressures, and achieving the goals of \"dual carbon\".",

This paper reviews applications of machine learning for the study of attenuation correction (AC) and low-count image reconstruction in quantitative positron emission tomography (PET). Specifically, we present the developments of machine learning methodology, ranging from random forest and dictionary learning to the latest convolutional neural network-based architectures. For application in PET attenuation correction, two general strategies are reviewed: 1) generating synthetic CT from MR or non-AC PET for the purposes of PET AC, and 2) direct conversion from non-AC PET to AC PET. For low-count PET reconstruction, recent deep learning-based studies and the potential advantages over conventional machine learning-based methods are presented and discussed. In each application, the proposed methods, study designs and performance of published studies are listed and compared with a brief discussion. Finally, the overall contributions and remaining challenges are summarized.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of robot-assisted surgery, the role of data-driven approaches to integrate statistics and machine learning is growing rapidly with prominent interests in objective surgical skill assessment. However, most existing work requires translating robot motion kinematics into intermediate features or gesture segments that are expensive to extract, lack efficiency, and require significant domain-specific knowledge. We propose an analytical deep learning framework for skill assessment in surgical training. A deep convolutional neural network is implemented to map multivariate time series data of the motion kinematics to individual skill levels. We perform experiments on the public minimally invasive surgical robotic dataset, JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). Our proposed learning model achieved competitive accuracies of 92.5%, 95.4%, and 91.3%, in the standard training tasks: Suturing, Needle-passing, and Knot-tying, respectively. Without the need of engineered features or carefully tuned gesture segmentation, our model can successfully decode skill information from raw motion profiles via end-to-end learning. Meanwhile, the proposed model is able to reliably interpret skills within a 1-3 second window, without needing an observation of entire training trial. This study highlights the potential of deep architectures for efficient online skill assessment in modern surgical training.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has shown extensive growth in recent years and is now routinely applied to sensitive areas. To allow appropriate verification of predictive models before deployment, models must be deterministic. Solely fixing all random seeds is not sufficient for deterministic machine learning, as major machine learning libraries default to the usage of nondeterministic algorithms based on atomic operations. Various machine learning libraries released deterministic counterparts to the nondeterministic algorithms. We evaluated the effect of these algorithms on determinism and runtime. Based on these results, we formulated a set of requirements for deterministic machine learning and developed a new software solution, the mlf-core ecosystem, which aids machine learning projects to meet and keep these requirements. We applied mlf-core to develop deterministic models in various biomedical fields including a single-cell autoencoder with TensorFlow, a PyTorch-based U-Net model for liver-tumor segmentation in computed tomography scans, and a liver cancer classifier based on gene expression profiles with XGBoost. The complete data together with the implementations of the mlf-core ecosystem and use case models are available at https://github.com/mlf-core.",

    "abstract": "\"Bad channels\" in implantable multi-channel recordings bring troubles into the precise quantitative description and analysis of neural signals, especially in the current \"big data\" era. In this paper, we combine multimodal features based on local field potentials (LFPs) and spike signals to detect bad channels automatically using machine learning. On the basis of 2632 pairs of LFPs and spike recordings acquired from five pigeons, 12 multimodal features are used to quantify each channel's temporal, frequency, phase and firing-rate properties. We implement seven classifiers in the detection tasks, in which the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) system and Fisher weighted Euclidean distance sorting (FWEDS) are used to cope with the class imbalance problem. The results of the two-dimensional scatterplots and classifications demonstrate that correlation coefficient, phase locking value, and coherence have good discriminability. For the multimodal features, almost all the classifiers can obtain high accuracy and bad channel detection rate after the SMOTE operation, in which the Random Forests classifier shows relatively better comprehensive performance (accuracy: 0.9092 ± 0.0081, precision: 0.9123 ± 0.0100, and recall: 0.9057 ± 0.0121). The proposed approach can automatically detect bad channels based on multimodal features, and the results provide valuable references for larger datasets.",

Researchers can select items from longer measures either to build a short-form or to administer items conditional on a participant's previous responses. Researchers who carry out these item selection strategies either focus on estimating a precise score on the measure (typically carried out in a psychometric approach) or on predicting the score on the measure (possibly taking a machine learning approach). However, it is unclear how scores from the psychometric and machine learning approaches compare to each other. In this paper, the following four statistical approaches to select items are reviewed and illustrated: item response theory to build static short-forms, computerized adaptive testing, the genetic algorithm, and regression trees. Theoretical strengths and weaknesses between these four statistical approaches are discussed, and the overlap between the areas of psychometrics and machine learning is considered.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is the leading human sensory system loss, and one of the leading causes for years lived with disability with significant effects on quality of life, social isolation, and overall health. Coupled with a forecast of increased hearing loss burden worldwide, national and international health organizations have urgently recommended that access to hearing evaluation be expanded to meet demand. The objective of this study was to develop 'AutoAudio' - a novel deep learning proof-of-concept model that accurately and quickly interprets diagnostic audiograms. Adult audiogram reports representing normal, conductive, mixed and sensorineural morphologies were used to train different neural network architectures. Image augmentation techniques were used to increase the training image set size. Classification accuracy on a separate test set was used to assess model performance. The architecture with the highest out-of-training set accuracy was ResNet-101 at 97.5%. Neural network training time varied between 2 to 7 h depending on the depth of the neural network architecture. Each neural network architecture produced misclassifications that arose from failures of the model to correctly label the audiogram with the appropriate hearing loss type. The most commonly misclassified hearing loss type were mixed losses. Re-engineering the process of hearing testing with a machine learning innovation may help enhance access to the growing worldwide population that is expected to require audiologist services. Our results suggest that deep learning may be a transformative technology that enables automatic and accurate audiogram interpretation.",

The standard clinical protocols for measuring these signals are challenging due to their invasive nature. This makes the estimation-based methods more convenient, however, they are usually not accurate as they fail to capture some important features of the central pressure waveforms. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach that combines machine learning tools and cross-relation-based blind estimation methods to reconstruct the aortic blood pressure waves from the distorted peripheral pressure signals. Due to the lack of large real datasets, in this study, we utilize virtual pulse waves in-silico databases to train the machine learning models. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the pure machine learning-based model and the cross-relation-based blind estimation approach. In both cases, the hybrid approach shows promising results as the root-mean-squared error has been reduced by 25% with regards to the pure machine learning method and by 40% compared to the cross-relation approach.",

To overcome them, a machine learning framework is developed based on symbolic regression via genetic programming. This evolutionary algorithm is capable of inferring physically interpretable models from cell aging data without requiring domain knowledge. This novel approach is compared against established approaches in case studies, which represent common tasks of lifetime prediction based on cycle and calendar aging data of 104 automotive lithium-ion pouch-cells. On average, predictive accuracy for extrapolations over storage time and energy throughput is increased by 38% and 13%, respectively. For predictions over other stress factors, error reductions of up to 77% are achieved. Furthermore, the evolutionary generated aging models meet requirements regarding applicability, generalizability, and interpretability. This highlights the potential of evolutionary algorithms to enhance cell aging predictions as well as insights.",

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs) are typically located in the regulatory regions of genes, driving high-level gene expression. Identifying SEs is crucial for a deeper understanding of gene regulatory networks, disease mechanisms, and the development and physiological processes of organisms, thus exerting a profound impact on research and applications in the life sciences field. Traditional experimental methods for identifying SEs are costly and time-consuming. Existing methods for predicting SEs based solely on sequence data use deep learning for feature representation and have achieved good results. However, they overlook biological features related to physicochemical properties, leading to low interpretability. Additionally, the complex model structure often requires extensive labeled data for training, which limits their further application in biological data. In this paper, we integrate the strengths of different models and proposes an ensemble model based on an integration strategy to enhance the model's generalization ability. It designs a multi-angle feature representation method that combines local structure and global information to extract high-dimensional abstract relationships and key low-dimensional biological features from sequences. This enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of the model's input features, providing technical support for discovering cell-specific and species-specific patterns of SEs. We evaluated the performance on both mouse and human datasets using five metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve accuracy, and others. Compared to the latest models, EnsembleSE achieved an average improvement of 4.5% in F1 score and an average improvement of 8.05% in recall, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the model on a unified test set.

    "title": "Prediction of attachment efficiency using machine learning on a comprehensive database and its validation.",
    "abstract": "Colloidal particles can attach to surfaces during transport, but the attachment depends on particle size, hydrodynamics, solid and water chemistry, and particulate matter. The attachment is quantified in filtration theory by measuring attachment or sticking efficiency (Alpha). A comprehensive Alpha database (2538 records) was built from experiments in the literature and used to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict Alpha. The training (r-squared: 0.86) was performed using two random forests capable of handling missing data. A holdout dataset was used to validate the training (r-squared: 0.98), and the variable importance was explored for training and validation. Finally, an additional validation dataset was built from quartz crystal microbalance experiments using surface-modified polystyrene, poly (methyl methacrylate), and polyethylene. The experiments were performed in the absence or presence of humic acid. Full database regression (r-squared: 0.90) predicted Alpha for the additional validation with an r-squared of 0.23. Nevertheless, when the original database and the additional validation dataset were combined into a new database, both the training (r-squared: 0.95) and validation (r-squared: 0.70) increased. The developed ML model provides a data-driven prediction of Alpha over a big database and evaluates the significance of 22 input variables.",

    "title": "Modeling suction of unsaturated granular soil treated with biochar in plant microbial fuel cell bioelectricity system.",
    "abstract": "There is an initiative driven by the carbon-neutrality nature of biochar in recent times, where various countries across Europe and North America have introduced perks to encourage the production of biochar for construction purposes. This objective aligns with the zero greenhouse emission targets set by COP27 for 2050. This research work seeks to assess the effectiveness of biochar in soils with varying grain size distributions in enhancing the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). This work further explores the effect of different combinations of biochar content (0 to 15 mass %) on the bioelectricity generation from biochar-improved plant microbial fuel cells (BPMFC). Additionally, different machine learning models such as the \"Gradient Boosting (GB)\", \"CN2 Rule Induction (CN2)\", \"Naive Bayes (NB)\", \"Support vector machine (SVM), \"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\", \"K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\", \"Tree Decision (Tree)\", \"Random Forest (RF)\", and \"Response Surface Methodology\" (RSM), have been developed to predict SWCC based on soil suction, electric current, electrical potential, volumetric water content, temperature, and bulk density. The newly established model demonstrates a reasonable ability to predict SWCC and a cheaper technology in predicting the suction of unsaturated soils in relation to the studied bioelectric factors of the BPMFC. Overall, in this research paper, the GB, SVM and CN2 outclassed the other regression techniques in this order thereby proposing the cheapest technology with the highest performance index to predict the SWCC behavior of unsaturated soils in a BPMFC system.",

    "title": "Improving Prediction of Risk of Hospital Admission in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Application of Machine Learning to Telemonitoring Data.",
    "abstract": "Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs has been suggested as a means of early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, with a view to instituting timely treatment. However, algorithms to identify exacerbations result in frequent false-positive results and increased workload. Machine learning, when applied to predictive modelling, can determine patterns of risk factors useful for improving prediction quality. Our objectives were to (1) establish whether machine learning techniques applied to telemonitoring datasets improve prediction of hospital admissions and decisions to start corticosteroids, and (2) determine whether the addition of weather data further improves such predictions. We used daily symptoms, physiological measures, and medication data, with baseline demography, COPD severity, quality of life, and hospital admissions from a pilot and large randomized controlled trial of telemonitoring in COPD. We linked weather data from the United Kingdom meteorological service. We used feature selection and extraction techniques for time series to construct up to 153 predictive patterns (features) from symptom, medication, and physiological measurements. We used the resulting variables to construct predictive models fitted to training sets of patients and compared them with common symptom-counting algorithms. We had a mean 363 days of telemonitoring data from 135 patients. The two most practical traditional score-counting algorithms, restricted to cases with complete data, resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates of 0.60 (95% CI 0.51-0.69) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.50-0.67) for predicting admissions based on a single day's readings. However, in a real-world scenario allowing for missing data, with greater numbers of patient daily data and hospitalizations (N=57,150, N =55, respectively), the performance of all the traditional algorithms fell, including those based on 2 days' data. One of the most frequently used algorithms performed no better than chance. All considered machine learning models demonstrated significant improvements; the best machine learning algorithm based on 57,150 episodes resulted in an aggregated AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.80). Adding weather data measurements did not improve the predictive performance of the best model (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.79). To achieve an 80% true-positive rate (sensitivity), the traditional algorithms were associated with an 80% false-positive rate: our algorithm halved this rate to approximately 40% (specificity approximately 60%). The machine learning algorithm was moderately superior to the best symptom-counting algorithm (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.79 vs AUC 0.66, 95% CI 0.63-0.68) at predicting the need for corticosteroids. Early detection and management of COPD remains an important goal given its huge personal and economic costs. Machine learning approaches, which can be tailored to an individual's baseline profile and can learn from experience of the individual patient, are superior to existing predictive algorithms and show promise in achieving this goal.

    "abstract": "The DynaSig-ML ('Dynamical Signatures-Machine Learning') Python package allows the efficient, user-friendly exploration of 3D dynamics-function relationships in biomolecules, using datasets of experimental measures from large numbers of sequence variants. It does so by predicting 3D structural dynamics for every variant using the Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM), a sequence-sensitive coarse-grained normal mode analysis model. Dynamical Signatures represent the fluctuation at every position in the biomolecule and are used as features fed into machine learning models of the user's choice. Once trained, these models can be used to predict experimental outcomes for theoretical variants. The whole pipeline can be run with just a few lines of Python and modest computational resources. The compute-intensive steps are easily parallelized in the case of either large biomolecules or vast amounts of sequence variants. As an example application, we use the DynaSig-ML package to predict the maturation efficiency of human microRNA miR-125a variants from high-throughput enzymatic assays.

However, the initial phases of drug discovery often face a scarcity of training data for these models. Meta-learning has emerged as a potentially promising strategy, harnessing the wealth of structure-activity data available for known targets to facilitate efficient few-shot model training for the specific target of interest. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta-learning methods, namely model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single-task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta-learning process.",

In particular, biomarker identification and pathway analysis are growing, as untargeted metabolomics is usable for discovery research. Frequently, new processing and statistical strategies are proposed to accommodate the increasing demand for robust and standardized data. One such algorithm is XCMS, which processes raw data into integrated peaks. Multiple studies have tried to assess the effect of optimizing XCMS parameters, but it is challenging to quantify the quality of the XCMS output. In this study, we investigate the effect of two automated optimization tools (Autotuner and isotopologue parameter optimization (IPO)) using the prediction power of machine learning as a proxy for the quality of the data set. We show that optimized parameters outperform default XCMS settings and that manually chosen parameters by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experts remain the best. Finally, the machine-learning approach of quality assessment is proposed for future evaluations of newly developed optimization methods because its performance directly measures the retained signal upon preprocessing.",

    "abstract": "We suggest a new method for the detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by analyzing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of blood serum of patients in question in comparison with SERS spectra of the serum of healthy donors. Spectral measurements were carried out on compact SERS substrates in dried blood serum droplets with immediate subsequent processing. To process the spectra, machine learning methods were used, in particular, the logistic regression method and the principal component method. Furthermore, thanks to the possibility of the physical-chemical interpretation of the coefficients of the method, the vibrational bands responsible for the signs of atrial fibrillation were identified and their correlation was carried out. Evaluation metrics were presented for the classification, among which the accuracy value was 0.82, that is a high indicator when analyzing samples directly from the blood serum of patients with the disease under study. It was shown that a small number of measured spectra for each sample (near 35 measurements) was sufficient to carry out the study. A comparative analysis of the logistic regression method and other commonly used machine learning methods was also carried out: support vector machines and random forest. Each method was evaluated and the advantages of logistic regression in solving the problem presented in this study were shown. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was also used for graphical representation and comparison of methods. The presented study shows the prospects for using the described method for the analysis of diseases associated with cardiac risks.",

    "title": "Deep graph clustering via aligning representation learning.",
    "abstract": "Deep graph clustering is a fundamental yet challenging task for graph data analysis. Recent efforts have witnessed significant success in combining autoencoder and graph convolutional network to explore graph-structured data. However, we observe that these approaches tend to map different nodes into the same representation, thus resulting in less discriminative node feature representation and limited clustering performance. Although some contrastive graph clustering methods alleviate the problem, they heavily depend on the carefully selected data augmentations, which greatly limits the capability of contrastive learning. Otherwise, they fail to consider the self-consistency between node representations and cluster assignments, thus affecting the clustering performance. To solve these issues, we propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method termed Aligning Representation Learning Network (ARLN). Specifically, we utilize contrastive learning between an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder to avoid conducting complex data augmentations. Moreover, we introduce an instance contrastive module and a feature contrastive module for consensus representation learning. Such modules are able to learn a discriminative node representation via contrastive learning. In addition, we design a novel assignment probability contrastive module to maintain the self-consistency between node representations and cluster assignments. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of the proposed ARLN against the existing state-of-the-art deep graph clustering methods.",

    "title": "MF-PCBA: Multifidelity High-Throughput Screening Benchmarks for Drug Discovery and Machine Learning.",
    "abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS), as one of the key techniques in drug discovery, is frequently used to identify promising drug candidates in a largely automated and cost-effective way. One of the necessary conditions for successful HTS campaigns is a large and diverse compound library, enabling hundreds of thousands of activity measurements per project. Such collections of data hold great promise for computational and experimental drug discovery efforts, especially when leveraged in combination with modern deep learning techniques, and can potentially lead to improved drug activity predictions and cheaper and more effective experimental design. However, existing collections of machine-learning-ready public datasets do not exploit the multiple data modalities present in real-world HTS projects. Thus, the largest fraction of experimental measurements, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of \"noisy\" activity values from primary screening, are effectively ignored in the majority of machine learning models of HTS data. To address these limitations, we introduce Multifidelity PubChem BioAssay (MF-PCBA), a curated collection of 60 datasets that includes two data modalities for each dataset, corresponding to primary and confirmatory screening, an aspect that we call . Multifidelity data accurately reflect real-world HTS conventions and present a new, challenging task for machine learning: the integration of low- and high-fidelity measurements through molecular representation learning, taking into account the orders-of-magnitude difference in size between the primary and confirmatory screens. Here we detail the steps taken to assemble MF-PCBA in terms of data acquisition from PubChem and the filtering steps required to curate the raw data. We also provide an evaluation of a recent deep-learning-based method for multifidelity integration across the introduced datasets, demonstrating the benefit of leveraging all HTS modalities, and a discussion in terms of the roughness of the molecular activity landscape. In total, MF-PCBA contains over 16.6 million unique molecule-protein interactions.

VAEs incorporate nonlinear relationships, allow users to define the dimensionality of the latent space, and in our tests preserve global geometry better than t-SNE and UMAP.

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on labor-intensive literature screening. While machine learning offers potential automation, its accuracy remains suboptimal. This raises the question of whether emerging large language models (LLMs) can provide a more accurate and efficient approach. This paper evaluates the sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of LLM-assisted literature screening. We conducted a diagnostic study comparing the accuracy of LLM-assisted screening versus manual literature screening across 6 thoracic surgery meta-analyses. Manual screening by 2 investigators served as the reference standard. LLM-assisted screening was performed using ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI) and Claude-3.5 (Anthropic) sonnet, with discrepancies resolved by Gemini-1.5 pro (Google). In addition, 2 open-source, machine learning-based screening tools, ASReview (Utrecht University) and Abstrackr (Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, Brown University School of Public Health), were also evaluated. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and 95% CIs for the title and abstract, as well as full-text screening, generating pooled estimates and SROC curves. LLM prompts were revised based on a post hoc error analysis. LLM-assisted full-text screening demonstrated high pooled sensitivity (0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.99) and specificity (0.96, 95% CI 0.91-0.98), with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97). Title and abstract screening achieved a pooled sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.85) and specificity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99), with an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.99). Post hoc revisions improved sensitivity to 0.98 (95% CI 0.74-1.00) while maintaining high specificity (0.98, 95% CI 0.94-0.99). In comparison, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of ASReview tool-assisted screening were 0.58 (95% CI 0.53-0.64) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-0.99), respectively, with an AUC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.62-0.70). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of Abstrackr tool-assisted screening were 0.48 (95% CI 0.35-0.62) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-0.99), respectively, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82). A post hoc meta-analysis revealed comparable effect sizes between LLM-assisted and conventional screening. LLMs hold significant potential for streamlining literature screening in systematic reviews, reducing workload without sacrificing quality. Importantly, LLMs outperformed traditional machine learning-based tools (ASReview and Abstrackr) in both sensitivity and AUC values, suggesting that LLMs offer a more accurate and efficient approach to literature screening.",

We used two open-access publicly available datasets (total of 122 surgeries) for model training, validation and testing. External validation was performed on 10 surgeries issued from another dataset. The AutoML model demonstrated excellent discriminating performance, even outperforming bespoke deep learning models handcrafter by experts. The area under the precision-recall curve was 0.855. At the 0.5 confidence threshold cut-off, the overall performance metrics were as follows: sensitivity (81.0%), recall (77.1%), accuracy (96.0%) and F1 score (0.79). The per-segment metrics varied across the surgical phases: precision 66.7-100%, recall 46.2-100% and specificity 94.1-100%. Hydrodissection and phacoemulsification were the most accurately predicted phases (100 and 92.31% correct predictions, respectively). During external validation, the average precision was 54.2% (0.00-90.0%), the recall was 61.1% (0.00-100%) and specificity was 96.2% (91.0-99.0%). In conclusion, a code-free AutoML model can accurately classify cataract surgery phases from videos with an accuracy comparable or better than models developed by experts.",

The challenge addressed in this paper is to determine the best method to estimate the glucose concentration in aqueous solutions in the presence of fructose from the measured reflectance spectra. This is referred to as the inverse problem of sensing and usually solved via linear regression. Here, instead, several advanced machine learning regression algorithms are proposed and compared, while the sensor data are subject to a pre-processing routine aiming to isolate key patterns from which to extract the relevant information. The most accurate and reliable predictions were finally made by a Gaussian process regression model which improves by more than 60% on previous approaches. Our findings give insight into the applicability of machine learning methods of regression for sensor calibration and explore the limitations of SEIRA glucose sensing.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning advancements have boosted Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) performance, but their wide-scale applicability is limited due to factors like individual health, hardware variations, and cultural differences affecting neural data. Studies often focus on uniform single-site experiments in uniform settings, leading to high performance that may not translate well to real-world diversity. Deep learning models aim to enhance BCI classification accuracy, and transfer learning has been suggested to adapt models to individual neural patterns using a base model trained on others' data. This approach promises better generalizability and reduced overfitting, yet challenges remain in handling diverse and imbalanced datasets from different equipment, subjects, multiple centres in different countries, and both healthy and patient populations for effective model transfer and tuning. In a setting characterized by maximal heterogeneity, we proposed P300 wave detection in BCIs employing a convolutional neural network fitted with adaptive transfer learning based on Poison Sampling Disk (PDS) called Active Sampling (AS), which flexibly adjusts the transition from source data to the target domain. Our results reported for subject adaptive with 40% of adaptive fine-tuning that the averaged classification accuracy improved by 5.36% and standard deviation reduced by 12.22% using two distinct, internationally replicated datasets. These results outperformed in classification accuracy, computational time, and training efficiency, mainly due to the proposed Active Sampling (AS) method for transfer learning.",

    "title": "Ensembles of knowledge graph embedding models improve predictions for drug discovery.",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Knowledge Graph Embedding Models (KGEMs) have led to their adoption in a broad range of fields and applications. The current publishing system in machine learning requires newly introduced KGEMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing at least one benchmark in order to be published. Despite this, dozens of novel architectures are published every year, making it challenging for users, even within the field, to deduce the most suitable configuration for a given application. A typical biomedical application of KGEMs is drug-disease prediction in the context of drug discovery, in which a KGEM is trained to predict triples linking drugs and diseases. These predictions can be later tested in clinical trials following extensive experimental validation. However, given the infeasibility of evaluating each of these predictions and that only a minimal number of candidates can be experimentally tested, models that yield higher precision on the top prioritized triples are preferred. In this paper, we apply the concept of ensemble learning on KGEMs for drug discovery to assess whether combining the predictions of several models can lead to an overall improvement in predictive performance. First, we trained and benchmarked 10 KGEMs to predict drug-disease triples on two independent biomedical KGs designed for drug discovery. Following, we applied different ensemble methods that aggregate the predictions of these models by leveraging the distribution or the position of the predicted triple scores. We then demonstrate how the ensemble models can achieve better results than the original KGEMs by benchmarking the precision (i.e., number of true positives prioritized) of their top predictions. Lastly, we released the source code presented in this work at https://github.com/enveda/kgem-ensembles-in-drug-discovery.",

Ensemble docking provides an economical way to account for receptor flexibility in molecular docking. Machine learning improves the use of the resulting docking scores to evaluate whether a compound is likely to be useful. EDock-ML takes a bottom-up approach in which machine-learning models are developed one protein at a time to improve predictions for the proteins included in its database. Because the machine-learning models are intended to be used without changing the docking and model parameters with which the models were trained, novice users can use it directly without worrying about what parameters to choose. A user simply submits a compound specified by an ID from the ZINC database (Sterling, T.; Irwin, J. J., J Chem Inf Model 2015, 55[11], 2,324-2,337.) or upload a file prepared by a chemical drawing program and receives an output helping the user decide the likelihood of the compound to be active or inactive for a drug target.

    "abstract": "Identifying COVID-19 through blood sample analysis is crucial in managing the disease and improving patient outcomes. Despite its advantages, the current test demands certified laboratories, expensive equipment, trained personnel, and 3-4 h for results, with a notable false-negative rate of 15%-20%. This study proposes a stacked deep-learning approach for detecting COVID-19 in blood samples to distinguish uninfected individuals from those infected with the virus. Three stacked deep learning architectures, namely the StackMean, StackMax, and StackRF algorithms, are introduced to improve the detection quality of single deep learning models. To counter the class imbalance phenomenon in the training data, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm is also implemented, resulting in increased specificity and sensitivity. The efficacy of the methods is assessed by utilizing blood samples obtained from hospitals in Brazil and Italy. Results revealed that the StackMax method greatly boosted the deep learning and traditional machine learning methods' capability to distinguish COVID-19-positive cases from normal cases, while SMOTE increased the specificity and sensitivity of the stacked models. Hypothesis testing is performed to determine if there is a significant statistical difference in the performance between the compared detection methods. Additionally, the significance of blood sample features in identifying COVID-19 is analyzed using the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) technique for feature importance identification. Overall, this methodology could potentially enhance the timely and precise identification of COVID-19 in blood samples.",

Unfortunately, avoiding label leakage in clinical prediction models requires more nuance than the common advice of applying \"no time machine rule.\" We provide a framework for contemplating whether and when model features pose leakage concerns by considering the cadence, perspective, and applicability of predictions. To ground these concepts, we use real-world clinical models to highlight examples of appropriate and inappropriate label leakage in practice. Finally, we provide recommendations to support clinical and technical stakeholders as they evaluate the leakage tradeoffs associated with model design, development, and implementation decisions. By providing common language and dimensions to consider when designing models, we hope the clinical prediction community will be better prepared to develop statistically valid and clinically useful machine learning models.",

This study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for BAE based on medial clavicle CT images and evaluate the performance on normal and variant clavicles. This study retrospectively collected 1049 patients (mean± SD: 22.50±4.34 years) and split them into normal training and test sets, and variant training and test sets. An additional 53 variant clavicles were incorporated into the variant test set. The development stages of normal MCE were used to build a linear model and support vector machine (SVM) for BAE. The CT slices of MCE were automatically segmented and used to train DL models for automated BAE. Comparisons were performed by linear versus ML versus DL, and normal versus variant clavicles. Mean absolute error (MAE) and classification accuracy was the primary parameter of comparison. For BAE, the SVM had the best MAE of 1.73 years, followed by the commonly-used CNNs (1.77-1.93 years), the linear model (1.94 years), and the hybrid neural network CoAt Net (2.01 years). In DL models, SE Net 18 was the best-performing DL model with similar results to SVM in the normal test set and achieved an MAE of 2.08 years in the external variant test. For age classification, all the models exhibit superior performance in the classification of 18-, 20-, 21-, and 22-year thresholds with limited value in the 16-year threshold. Both ML and DL models produce desirable performance in BAE based on medial clavicle CT.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is an effective tool for predicting reaction rate constants for many organic compounds with the hydroxyl radical (HO ). Previously reported models have achieved relatively good performance, but due to scarce data (<1400 records), the applicability domain (AD) has been significantly limited. To address this limitation, we curated a much larger experimental data set (Primary data set), which contains 2358 kinetic records. We then employed both the group contribution method (GCM) and a semisupervised learning (SSL) strategy to add new data points, aiming to effectively expand the model's AD while improving model performance. The results indicated that GCM improved the model's performance for chemicals outside the AD, while SSL expanded the model's AD. The final model, after incorporating 147,168 new data points, achieved an = 0.77, root-mean-square-error = 0.32, and mean-absolute-error = 0.24 on the test set. Importantly, the AD was expanded by 117% compared to the model developed solely based on the Primary data set, and the final model can be reliably applied to more than 560,000 chemicals from the DSSTox database. Further model interpretation results indicated that the model made predictions based on a correct \"understanding\" of the impact of key substituents and reactive sites toward HO . This research provides an effective method for augmenting data sets, which is important in improving ML model performance and expanding AD. The final model has been made widely accessible through a free online predictor.",

    "abstract": "The past 5 years have seen an explosion of interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques in medicine. This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. DNNs are 'trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests.

    "abstract": "Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) have been used to predict mixture toxicity. However, current research faces gaps in achieving accurate predictions of the mixture toxicity of azole fungicides. To address this gap, the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms has emerged as an effective strategy. In this study, we applied 12 algorithms, namely, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), kernel k-nearest neighbors (KKNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), cubist, bagged multivariate adaptive regression splines (Bagged MARS), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost), boosted generalized additive model (GAMBoost), bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNN), and recursive partitioning and regression trees (CART) to build ML models for 225 mixture toxicity of azole fungicides towards Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa. A total of 36 single ML models and 12 consensus models were developed. The results indicated that models employing concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and molecular descriptors (MD) as variables demonstrated superior predictive abilities. The consensus model combining SVM and RF algorithms (labeled as CM0) demonstrated the highest level of accuracy in fitting the data, with a coefficient of determination of 0.980. Additionally, it showed strong predictive abilities when tested with external data, achieving an external R value of 0.945 and a Concordance Correlation Coefficient of 0.967.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of digital technologies, particularly in big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), is reshaping the global health care system, including in Bangladesh. The increased adoption of these technologies in health care delivery within Bangladesh has sparked their integration into health care and public health research, resulting in a noticeable surge in related studies. However, a critical gap exists, as there is a lack of comprehensive evidence regarding the research landscape; regulatory challenges; use cases; and the application and adoption of BDA, AI, ML, and DL in the health care system of Bangladesh. This gap impedes the attainment of optimal results. As Bangladesh is a leading implementer of digital technologies, bridging this gap is urgent for the effective use of these advancing technologies. This scoping review aims to collate (1) the existing research in Bangladesh's health care system, using the aforementioned technologies and synthesizing their findings, and (2) the limitations faced by researchers in integrating the aforementioned technologies into health care research. MEDLINE (via PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched to identify published research articles between January 1, 2000, and September 10, 2023, meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) any study using any of the BDA, AI, ML, and DL technologies and health care and public health datasets for predicting health issues and forecasting any kind of outbreak; (2) studies primarily focusing on health care and public health issues in Bangladesh; and (3) original research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings written in English. With the initial search, we identified 1653 studies. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria and full-text review, 4.66% (77/1653) of the articles were finally included in this review. There was a substantial increase in studies over the last 5 years (2017-2023). Among the 77 studies, the majority (n=65, 84%) used ML models. A smaller proportion of studies incorporated AI (4/77, 5%), DL (7/77, 9%), and BDA (1/77, 1%) technologies. Among the reviewed articles, 52% (40/77) relied on primary data, while the remaining 48% (37/77) used secondary data. The primary research areas of focus were infectious diseases (15/77, 19%), noncommunicable diseases (23/77, 30%), child health (11/77, 14%), and mental health (9/77, 12%). This scoping review highlights remarkable progress in leveraging BDA, AI, ML, and DL within Bangladesh's health care system. The observed surge in studies over the last 5 years underscores the increasing significance of AI and related technologies in health care research. Notably, most (65/77, 84%) studies focused on ML models, unveiling opportunities for advancements in predictive modeling. This review encapsulates the current state of technological integration and propels us into a promising era for the future of digital Bangladesh.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Based on Machine Learning in Pharmacovigilance: A Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence based on machine learning has made large advancements in many fields of science and medicine but its impact on pharmacovigilance is yet unclear. The present study conducted a scoping review of the use of artificial intelligence based on machine learning to understand how it is used for pharmacovigilance tasks, characterize differences with other fields, and identify opportunities to improve pharmacovigilance through the use of machine learning. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched to identify articles pertaining to the use of machine learning in pharmacovigilance published from the year 2000 to September 2021. After manual screening of 7744 abstracts, a total of 393 papers met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. Extraction of key data on study design, data sources, sample size, and machine learning methodology was performed. Studies with the characteristics of good machine learning practice were defined and manual review focused on identifying studies that fulfilled these criteria and results that showed promise. The majority of studies (53%) were focused on detecting safety signals using traditional statistical methods. Of the studies that used more recent machine learning methods, 61% used off-the-shelf techniques with minor modifications. Temporal analysis revealed that newer methods such as deep learning have shown increased use in recent years. We found only 42 studies (10%) that reflect current best practices and trends in machine learning. In the subset of 154 papers that focused on data intake and ingestion, 30 (19%) were found to incorporate the same best practices. Advances from artificial intelligence have yet to fully penetrate pharmacovigilance, although recent studies show signs that this may be changing.",

    "title": "Role of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning models in corneal disorders - A narrative review.",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted ophthalmology, particularly in managing corneal diseases, a major reversible cause of blindness. This review explores AI's transformative role in the corneal subspecialty, which has adopted advanced technology for superior clinical judgment, early diagnosis, and personalized therapy. While AI's role in anterior segment diseases is less documented compared to glaucoma and retinal pathologies, this review highlights its integration into corneal diagnostics through imaging techniques like slit-lamp biomicroscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and in vivo confocal biomicroscopy. AI has been pivotal in refining decision-making and prognosis for conditions such as keratoconus, infectious keratitis, and dystrophies. Multi-disease deep learning neural networks (MDDNs) have shown diagnostic ability in classifying corneal diseases using AS-OCT images, achieving notable metrics like an AUC of 0.910. AI's progress over two decades has significantly improved the accuracy of diagnosing conditions like keratoconus and microbial keratitis. For instance, AI has achieved a 90.7% accuracy rate in classifying bacterial and fungal keratitis and an AUC of 0.910 in differentiating various corneal diseases. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enhanced the analysis of color-coded corneal maps, yielding up to 99.3% diagnostic accuracy for keratoconus. Deep learning algorithms have also shown robust performance in detecting fungal hyphae on in vivo confocal microscopy, with precise quantification of hyphal density. AI models combining tomography scans and visual acuity have demonstrated up to 97% accuracy in keratoconus staging according to the Amsler-Krumeich classification. However, the review acknowledges the limitations of current AI models, including their reliance on binary classification, which may not capture the complexity of real-world clinical presentations with multiple coexisting disorders. Challenges also include dependency on data quality, diverse imaging protocols, and integrating multimodal images for a generalized AI diagnosis. The need for interpretability in AI models is emphasized to foster trust and applicability in clinical settings. Looking ahead, AI has the potential to unravel the intricate mechanisms behind corneal pathologies, reduce healthcare's carbon footprint, and revolutionize diagnostic and management paradigms. Ethical and regulatory considerations will accompany AI's clinical adoption, marking an era where AI not only assists but augments ophthalmic care.",

We also used 3-year medical data of all patients before the diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) as the dimensional time in the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were computed to measure the performance of the model. The results showed the mean (SD) of AUC of the model was 0.922 (0.004). Moreover, the performance of the model observed the sensitivity of 0.837, specificity of 0.867, and 0.532 for PPV value.

This problem is computationally hard and previous solutions are limited to small and/or severely restricted data sets, for example, a set of binary trees with the same taxon set or only two non-binary trees with non-equal taxon sets. Building on our previous work on binary trees, we present FHyNCH, the first algorithmic framework to heuristically solve the Hybridization problem for large sets of multifurcating trees whose sets of taxa may differ. Our heuristics combine the cherry-picking technique, recently proposed to solve the same problem for binary trees, with two carefully designed machine-learning models. We demonstrate that our methods are practical and produce qualitatively good solutions through experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.",

One of the key objectives of speech technology research is to improve the quality of life of its users, as evidenced by the focus of current research trends on creating inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to pathological speech, out of which dysarthric speech is an important example. Applications of speech technology research for dysarthric speech demand a clear understanding of the acoustics of dysarthric speech as well as of speech technologies, including machine learning and deep neural networks for speech processing. We review studies pertaining to speech technology and dysarthric speech. Specifically, we discuss dysarthric speech corpora, acoustic analysis, intelligibility assessment, and automatic speech recognition. We also delve into deep learning approaches for automatic assessment and recognition of dysarthric speech. Ethics committee or institutional review board did not apply to this study. Overcoming the challenge of limited data and exploring new avenues in data collection, artificial intelligence-powered analysis and teletherapy hold immense potential for significant advancements in dysarthria research. To make longer and faster strides, researchers typically rely on existing research and data on a global scale. Therefore, it is imperative to consolidate the existing research and present it in a form that can serve as a basis for future work. In this review article, we have reviewed the contributions of speech technologists to the area of dysarthric speech with a focus on acoustic analysis, speech features, and techniques used. By focusing on the existing research and future directions, researchers can develop more effective tools and interventions to improve communication, quality of life, and overall well-being for people with dysarthria.",

    "title": "Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging Over Non-IID Datasets With Unbalanced Modalities.",
    "abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) for cancer staging through medical image analysis has gained substantial interest across medical disciplines. When accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure. Given the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records, leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise for cancer staging. However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a portion of data modalities within the system. In this work, we introduce a novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting strategy tailored for multi-modal FL. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments using The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) datalake considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information. Our results further unveil the impact and severity of class-based vs type-based heterogeneity across institutions on the model performance, which widens the perspective to the notion of data heterogeneity in multi-modal FL literature.",

    "title": "A machine learning-based framework to identify type 2 diabetes through electronic health records.",
    "abstract": "To discover diverse genotype-phenotype associations affiliated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) via genome-wide association study (GWAS) and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), more cases (T2DM subjects) and controls (subjects without T2DM) are required to be identified (e.g., via Electronic Health Records (EHR)). However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate. We propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. We apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification performances (∼0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). Expert algorithm-based identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls. Our proposed framework demonstrates a more accurate and efficient approach for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR.",

    "abstract": "Clinical staff providing addiction treatment predict patient outcome poorly. Prognoses based on linear statistics are rarely replicated. Addiction is a complex non-linear behavior. Incorporating non-linear models, Machine Learning (ML) has successfully predicted treatment outcome when applied in other areas of medicine. Using identical assessment data across the two groups, this study compares the accuracy of ML models versus clinical staff to predict alcohol dependence treatment outcome in behavior therapy using patient data only. Machine learning models (n = 28) were constructed ('trained') using demographic and psychometric assessment data from 780 previously treated patients who had undertaken a 12 week, abstinence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for alcohol dependence. Independent predictions applying assessment data for an additional 50 consecutive patients were obtained from 10 experienced addiction therapists and the 28 trained ML models. The predictive accuracy of the ML models and the addiction therapists was then compared with further investigation of the 10 best models selected by cross-validated accuracy on the training-set. Variables selected as important for prediction by staff and the most accurate ML model were examined. The most accurate ML model (Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm, 74%) was significantly more accurate than the four least accurate clinical staff (51%-40%). However, the robustness of this finding may be limited by the moderate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC = 0.49). There was no significant difference in mean aggregate predictive accuracy between 10 clinical staff (56.1%) and the 28 best models (58.57%). Addiction therapists favoured demographic and consumption variables compared with the ML model using more questionnaire subscales. The majority of staff and ML models were not more accurate than suggested by chance. However, the best performing prediction models may provide useful adjunctive information to standard clinically available prognostic data to more effectively target treatment approaches in clinical settings.",

Prognostic models that use electronic medical record (EMR) data to determine 1-year death risk can improve end-of-life planning and risk adjustment for research. Determine if the final set of demographic, vital sign, and laboratory data from a hospitalization can be used to accurately quantify 1-year mortality risk. A retrospective study using electronic medical record data linked with the state death registry. A total of 59,848 hospitalized patients within a six-hospital network over a 4-year period. The last set of vital signs, complete blood count, basic and complete metabolic panel, demographic information, and ICD codes. The outcome of interest was death within 1 year. Model performance was measured on the validation data set. Random forests (RF) outperformed logisitic regression (LR) models in discriminative ability. An RF model that used the final set of demographic, vitals, and laboratory data from the final 48 h of hospitalization had an AUC of 0.86 (0.85-0.87) for predicting death within a year. Age, blood urea nitrogen, platelet count, hemoglobin, and creatinine were the most important variables in the RF model. Models that used comorbidity variables alone had the lowest AUC. In groups of patients with a high probability of death, RF models underestimated the probability by less than 10%. The last set of EMR data from a hospitalization can be used to accurately estimate the risk of 1-year mortality within a cohort of multicondition hospitalized patients.",

Our approach, to combine physical process models with data-driven machine learning techniques, allows us to overcome limitations specific to each individual component, and it enables us to carry out probabilistic analyses, such as global sensitivity studies and uncertainty quantification for real-case non-linearly coupled physical problems. It additionally provides orders of magnitude computational gain, while maintaining an accuracy higher than measurement errors.

DeepConvLSTM and convolutional neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy compared to other models with 91.1 (3.8) and 89.3 (4.0) % respectively compared to the recurrent neural network or multi-layer perceptron. Integrating convolutional layers in a deep learning model seems to be an appropriate solution for sign language recognition with depth sensors data.",

    "title": "Prediction of gender from longitudinal MRI data via deep learning on adolescent data reveals unique patterns associated with brain structure and change over a two-year period.",
    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms for predicting neuroimaging data have shown considerable promise in various applications. Prior work has demonstrated that deep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can outperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most prior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults. Within the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large longitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict gender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results demonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (>97%) with training epochs > 200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions identified as the most discriminative in the task under study include predominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender predictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of visual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust gender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range. This suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during adolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral and environmental factors.",

    "title": "Metabolism-triggered sensor array aided by machine learning for rapid identification of pathogens.",
    "abstract": "Chemical-nose strategy has achieved certain success in the discrimination and identification of pathogens. However, this strategy usually relies on non-specific interactions, which are prone to be significantly disturbed by the change of environment thus limiting its practical usefulness. Herein, we present a novel chemical-nose sensing approach leveraging the difference in the dynamic metabolic variation during peptidoglycan metabolism among different species for rapid pathogen discrimination. Pathogens were first tethered with clickable handles through metabolic labeling at two different acidities (pH = 5 and 7) for 20 and 60 min, respectively, followed by click reaction with fluorescence up-conversion nanoparticles to generate a four-dimensional signal output. This discriminative multi-dimensional signal allowed eight types of model bacteria to be successfully classified within the training set into strains, genera, and Gram phenotypes. As the difference in signals of the four sensing channels reflects the difference in the amount/activity of enzymes involved in metabolic labeling, this strategy has good anti-interference capability, which enables precise pathogen identification within 2 h with 100% accuracy in spiked urinary samples and allows classification of unknown species out of the training set into the right phenotype. The robustness of this approach holds significant promise for its widespread application in pathogen identification and surveillance.",

Nonlinear models are generated using machine learning methods. We introduce a novel approach for potency prediction that depends on a newly designed molecular fingerprint (FP) representation. This structure-potency fingerprint (SPFP) combines different modules accounting for the structural features of active compounds and their potency values in a single bit string, hence unifying structure and potency representation. This encoding enables the derivation of a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) using SPFPs of training compounds and apply the model to predict the SPFP potency module of test compounds using only their structure module as input. The SPFP-CVAE approach correctly predicts the potency values of compounds belonging to different activity classes with an accuracy comparable to support vector regression (SVR), representing the state-of-the-art in the field. In addition, highly potent compounds are predicted with very similar accuracy as SVR and deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Predicting phenotypes and complex traits from genomic variations has always been a big challenge in molecular biology, at least in part because the task is often complicated by the influences of external stimuli and the environment on regulation of gene expression. With today's abundance of omic data and advances in high-throughput computing and machine learning (ML), we now have an unprecedented opportunity to uncover the missing links and molecular mechanisms that control gene expression and phenotypes. To empower molecular biologists and researchers in related fields to start using ML for in-depth analyses of their large-scale data, here we provide a summary of fundamental concepts of machine learning, and describe a wide range of research questions and scenarios in molecular biology where ML has been implemented. Due to the abundance of data, reproducibility, and genome-wide coverage, we focus on transcriptomics, and two ML tasks involving it: (a) predicting of transcriptomic profiles or transcription levels from genomic variations in DNA, and (b) predicting phenotypes of interest from transcriptomic profiles or transcription levels. Similar approaches can also be applied to more complex data such as those in multi-omic studies. We envisage that the concepts and examples described here will raise awareness and promote the application of ML among molecular biologists, and eventually help improve a framework for systematic design and predictions of gene expression and phenotypes for synthetic biology applications.",

    "title": "Using Decomposed Error for Reproducing Implicit Understanding of Algorithms.",
    "abstract": "Reproducibility is important for having confidence in evolutionary machine learning algorithms. Although the focus of reproducibility is usually to recreate an aggregate prediction error score using fixed random seeds, this is not sufficient. Firstly, multiple runs of an algorithm, without a fixed random seed, should ideally return statistically equivalent results. Secondly, it should be confirmed whether the expected behaviour of an algorithm matches its actual behaviour, in terms of how an algorithm targets a reduction in prediction error. Confirming the behaviour of an algorithm is not possible when using a total error aggregate score. Using an error decomposition framework as a methodology for improving the reproducibility of results in evolutionary computation addresses both of these factors. By estimating decomposed error using multiple runs of an algorithm and multiple training sets, the framework provides a greater degree of certainty about the prediction error. Also, decomposing error into bias, variance due to the algorithm (internal variance), and variance due to the training data (external variance) more fully characterises evolutionary algorithms. This allows the behaviour of an algorithm to be confirmed. Applying the framework to a number of evolutionary algorithms shows that their expected behaviour can be different to their actual behaviour. Identifying a behaviour mismatch is important in terms of understanding how to further refine an algorithm as well as how to effectively apply an algorithm to a problem.",

Combining semantic imaging features, radiomics features, and deep-learning signatures in machine-learning models has demonstrated superior predictive performances compared to individual feature sources. Furthermore, incorporating features from both tumor volume and peritumor region is beneficial.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive number of smart devices capable of data collection, storage, processing, and communication. The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.",

For their implementation, an R package has been written to search for the optimum tuning parameters under cross-validation and perform sex/ancestry classification. It was found that the classification performance may vary significantly depending on the problem. From the methods tested, LDA and the machine learning technique of linear SVM exhibit the best performance, with high prediction accuracy and relatively low bias in most of the tests. ANN and pMLR can generally be considered to give satisfactory predictions, whereas NBC when using metric traits and DT are the worst of the classification methods examined.

However, diagnosis of VLS is often delayed due to its variable clinical presentation and shame-related late consultation. Machine learning (ML)-trained image recognition software could potentially facilitate early diagnosis of VLS. To develop a ML-trained image-based model for the detection of VLS. Images of both VLS and non-VLS anogenital skin were collected, anonymized, and selected. In the VLS images, 10 typical skin signs (whitening, hyperkeratosis, purpura/ecchymosis, erosion/ulcers/excoriation, erythema, labial fusion, narrowing of the introitus, labia minora resorption, posterior commissure (fourchette) band formation and atrophic shiny skin) were manually labelled. A deep convolutional neural network was built using the training set as input data and then evaluated using the test set, where the developed algorithm was run three times and the results were then averaged. A total of 684 VLS images and 403 non-VLS images (70% healthy vulva and 30% with other vulvar diseases) were included after the selection process. A deep learning algorithm was developed by training on 775 images (469 VLS and 306 non-VLS) and testing on 312 images (215 VLS and 97 non-VLS). This algorithm performed accurately in discriminating between VLS and non-VLS cases (including healthy individuals and non-VLS dermatoses), with mean values of 0.94, 0.99 and 0.95 for recall, precision and accuracy, respectively. This pilot project demonstrated that our image-based deep learning model can effectively discriminate between VLS and non-VLS skin, representing a promising tool for future use by clinicians and possibly patients.

Existing experimental techniques for identifying CPPs are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, the prediction of CPPs from peptide sequences by using computational methods can be useful to annotate and guide the experimental process quickly. Many machine learning-based methods have recently emerged for identifying CPPs. Although considerable progress has been made, existing methods still have low feature representation capabilities, thereby limiting further performance improvements. We propose a method called StackCPPred, which proposes three feature methods on the basis of the pairwise energy content of the residue as follows: RECM-composition, PseRECM and RECM-DWT. These features are used to train stacking-based machine learning methods to effectively predict CPPs. On the basis of the CPP924 and CPPsite3 datasets with jackknife validation, StackDPPred achieved 94.5% and 78.3% accuracy, which was 2.9% and 5.8% higher than the state-of-the-art CPP predictors, respectively. StackCPPred can be a powerful tool for predicting CPPs and their uptake efficiency, facilitating hypothesis-driven experimental design and accelerating their applications in clinical therapy.

    "abstract": "The success behind Machine Learning (ML) methods has largely been attributed to the quality and quantity of the available data which can spread across multiple owners. A Federated Learning (FL) from distributed datasets often provides a reliable solution that provides valuable insight. For a genomic dataset, such data have also proven to be sensitive which requires additional safety mechanisms before any sharing or ML operations. We propose a generalized gene expression data sharing method using a differentially private mechanism. Due to the large number of genes available, the data dimension is also reduced to accommodate smaller privacy budgets as we utilize an exponential mechanism to create a private histogram from numeric expression data. The output histogram can be used in any federated machine learning setting having multiple data owners. The proposed solution was submitted to genomic data security and privacy competition, iDash 2020 where it ranked third among 55 teams. We extend the proposed solution and experimented with two different machine learning algorithms and different settings. The experimental results show that it takes around 8 s to train a model while achieving 0.89 AUC with only a privacy budget of 5. The paper outlined a method to share gene expression data for Federated Learning using a privacy-preserving mechanism. Different experimental settings and recent competition results show the efficacy of the method which can be further extended to other genomic datasets and machine learning algorithms.",

Recently physics-constrained neural networks (PCNNs) were developed to reduce the required amount of training data. However, the weights of different losses from data and physical constraints are adjusted empirically in PCNNs. In this paper, a new physics-constrained neural network with the minimax architecture (PCNN-MM) is proposed so that the weights of different losses can be adjusted systematically. The training of the PCNN-MM is searching the high-order saddle points of the objective function. A novel saddle point search algorithm called Dual-Dimer method is developed. It is demonstrated that the Dual-Dimer method is computationally more efficient than the gradient descent ascent method for nonconvex-nonconcave functions and provides additional eigenvalue information to verify search results. A heat transfer example also shows that the convergence of PCNN-MMs is faster than that of traditional PCNNs.",

Our method uses an artificial neural network that utilizes the received signal strength indicator along with a signal's angle of arrival to calculate the line-of-sight distance. This combination results in a significant reduction of the error caused by multipath effects that common RSSI-based methods suffer from. It outperforms traditional ranging methods while the implementation complexity is kept low.",

    "title": "Developing a Process for the Analysis of User Journeys and the Prediction of Dropout in Digital Health Interventions: Machine Learning Approach.",
    "abstract": "User dropout is a widespread concern in the delivery and evaluation of digital (ie, web and mobile apps) health interventions. Researchers have yet to fully realize the potential of the large amount of data generated by these technology-based programs. Of particular interest is the ability to predict who will drop out of an intervention. This may be possible through the analysis of user journey data-self-reported as well as system-generated data-produced by the path (or journey) an individual takes to navigate through a digital health intervention. The purpose of this study is to provide a step-by-step process for the analysis of user journey data and eventually to predict dropout in the context of digital health interventions. The process is applied to data from an internet-based intervention for insomnia as a way to illustrate its use. The completion of the program is contingent upon completing 7 sequential cores, which include an initial tutorial core. Dropout is defined as not completing the seventh core. Steps of user journey analysis, including data transformation, feature engineering, and statistical model analysis and evaluation, are presented. Dropouts were predicted based on data from 151 participants from a fully automated web-based program (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet) that delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees were used and evaluated based on their predictive performance. Relevant features from the data are reported that predict user dropout. Accuracy of predicting dropout (area under the curve [AUC] values) varied depending on the program core and the machine learning technique. After model evaluation, boosted decision trees achieved AUC values ranging between 0.6 and 0.9. Additional handcrafted features, including time to complete certain steps of the intervention, time to get out of bed, and days since the last interaction with the system, contributed to the prediction performance. The results support the feasibility and potential of analyzing user journey data to predict dropout. Theory-driven handcrafted features increased the prediction performance. The ability to predict dropout at an individual level could be used to enhance decision making for researchers and clinicians as well as inform dynamic intervention regimens.",

    "title": "How Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Is Assisting Us to Extract Meaning from Data on Bone Mechanics?",
    "abstract": "Dramatic advancements in interdisciplinary research with the fourth paradigm of science, especially the implementation of computer science, nourish the potential for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to be applied to studies concerning mechanics of bones. Despite recent enormous advancement in techniques, gaining deep knowledge to find correlations between bone shape, material, mechanical, and physical responses as well as properties is a daunting task. This is due to both complexity of the material itself and the convoluted shapes that this complex material forms. Moreover, many uncertainties and ambiguities exist concerning the use of traditional computational techniques that hinders gaining a full comprehension of this advanced biological material. This book chapter offers a review of literature on the use of AI, ML, and ANN in the study of bone mechanics research. A main question as to why to implement AI and ML in the mechanics of bones is fully addressed and explained. This chapter also introduces AI and ML and elaborates on the main features of ML algorithms such as learning paradigms, subtypes, main ideas with examples, performance metrics, training algorithms, and training datasets. As a frequently employed ML algorithm in bone mechanics, feedforward ANNs are discussed to make their taxonomy and working principles more readily comprehensible to researchers. A summary as well as detailed review of papers that employed ANNs to learn from collected data on bone mechanics are presented. Reviewing literature on the use of these data-driven tools is essential since their wider application has the potential to: improve clinical assessments enabling real-time simulations; avoid and/or minimize injuries; and, encourage early detection of such injuries in the first place.",

    "abstract": "In sucker-rod pumping wells, due to the lack of an early diagnosis of operating condition or sensor faults, several problems can go unnoticed. These problems can increase downtime and production loss. In these wells, the diagnosis of operation conditions is carried out through downhole dynamometer cards, via pre-established patterns, with human visual effort in the operation centers. Starting with machine learning algorithms, several papers have been published on the subject, but it is still common to have doubts concerning the difficulty level of the dynamometer card classification task and best practices for solving the problem. In the search for answers to these questions, this work carried out sixty tests with more than 50,000 dynamometer cards from 38 wells in the Mossoró, RN, Brazil. In addition, it presented test results for three algorithms (decision tree, random forest and XGBoost), three descriptors (Fourier, wavelet and card load values), as well as pipelines provided by automated machine learning. Tests with and without the tuning of hypermeters, different levels of dataset balancing and various evaluation metrics were evaluated. The research shows that it is possible to detect sensor failures from dynamometer cards. Of the results that will be presented, 75% of the tests had an accuracy above 92% and the maximum accuracy was 99.84%.",

    "title": "Using machine learning analyses to explore relations between eyewitness lineup looking behaviors and suspect guilt.",
    "abstract": "We conducted 2 experiments using machine learning to better understand which lineup looking behaviors postdict suspect guilt., Hypotheses: We hypothesized that (a) lineups with guilty suspects would be subject to shorter viewing duration of all images and fewer image looks overall than lineups with innocent suspects, and (b) confidence and accuracy would be positively correlated. The question of which factors would combine to best postdict suspect guilt was exploratory. Experiment 1 included 405 children (6-14 years; 43% female) who each made 2 eyewitness identifications after viewing 2 live targets. Experiment 2 included 342 adult participants ( = 21.00; females = 75%) who each made 2 identifications after viewing a video including 2 targets. Participants made identifications using an interactive touchscreen simultaneous lineup in which they were restricted to viewing one image at a time and their interaction with the lineup was recorded. In Experiment 1, five variables (filler look time, suspect look time, number of suspect looks, number of filler looks, and winner look time) together postdicted (with a 67% accuracy score) target presence. In Experiment 2, four variables (number of suspect looks, number of filler looks, number of loser looks, and winner looks) together postdicted (with a 73% accuracy score) target presence. Further exploration of witness search behaviors can provide context to identification decisions. Understanding which behaviors postdict suspect guilt may assist with interpretation of identification decisions in the same way that decision confidence is currently used.

    "abstract": "The aims are to explore the construction of the knowledge management model for engineering cost consulting enterprises, and to expand the application of data mining techniques and machine learning methods in constructing knowledge management model. Through a questionnaire survey, the construction of the knowledge management model of construction-related enterprises and engineering cost consulting enterprises is discussed. First, through the analysis and discussion of ontology-based data mining (OBDM) algorithm and association analysis (Apriori) algorithm, a data mining algorithm (ML-AR algorithm) on account of ontology-based multilayer association and machine learning is proposed. The performance of the various algorithms is compared and analyzed. Second, based on the knowledge management level, analysis and statistics are conducted on the levels of knowledge acquisition, sharing, storage, and innovation. Finally, according to the foregoing, the knowledge management model based on engineering cost consulting enterprises is built and analyzed. The results show that the reliability coefficient of this questionnaire is above 0.8, and the average extracted value is above 0.7, verifying excellent reliability and validity. The efficiency of the ML-AR algorithm at both the number of transactions and the support level is better than the other two algorithms, which is expected to be applied to the enterprise knowledge management model. There is a positive correlation between each level of knowledge management; among them, the positive correlation between knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing is the strongest. The enterprise knowledge management model has a positive impact on promoting organizational innovation capability and industrial development. The research work provides a direction for the development of enterprise knowledge management and the improvement of innovation ability.",

However, for quantification of regional CBF, an arterial input function (AIF), obtained from arterial blood sampling, is required. In this work we evaluated a novel, non-invasive approach for input function prediction based on machine learning (MLIF), against AIF for CBF PET measurements in human subjects.Twenty-five subjects underwent two 10 min dynamic O-water brain PET scans with continuous arterial blood sampling, before (baseline) and following acetazolamide medication. Three different image-derived time-activity curves were automatically segmented from the carotid arteries and used as input into a Gaussian process-based AIF prediction model, considering both baseline and acetazolamide scans as training data. The MLIF approach was evaluated by comparing AIF and MLIF curves, as well as whole-brain grey matter CBF values estimated by kinetic modelling derived with either AIF or MLIF.The results showed that AIF and MLIF curves were similar and that corresponding CBF values were highly correlated and successfully differentiated before and after acetazolamide medication. In conclusion, our non-invasive MLIF method shows potential to replace the AIF obtained from blood sampling for CBF measurements using O-water PET and kinetic modelling.",

Various aspects are contained, including the biochar application in the elimination of heavy metals and/or organic compounds and the biochar application in environmental and economic scopes, for instance, food security, energy, and carbon emission. The utilization of ML methods, including ANN, RF, and NN, plays a vital role in evaluating and predicting the efficiency of biochar absorption. It has been proved that ML methods can validly predict the adsorption effectiveness of biochar for water heavy metals with higher accuracy. Moreover, the literature proposed a comprehensive data-driven model to forecast biochar yield and compositions under various biomass input feedstock and different pyrolysis criteria. They said a 12.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the existing literature. However, it might need further optimization in this direction. In summary, this review concludes increasing studies that a well-trained ML method can sufficiently reduce the number of experiment trials and working times associated with higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, further studies on ML applications are needed to optimize the trade-off between biochar yield and its composition.",

    "abstract": "Genomes encode elaborate networks of genes whose products must seamlessly interact to support living organisms. Humans' capacity to understand these biological systems is limited by their sheer size and complexity. In this article, we develop a proof of concept framework for training a machine learning (ML) algorithm to model bacterial genome composition. To achieve this, we create simplified representations of genomes in the form of binary vectors that indicate the encoded genes, henceforth referred to as genome vectors. A denoising variational autoencoder was trained to accept corrupted genome vectors, in which most genes had been masked, and reconstruct the original. The resulting model, DeepGenomeVector, effectively captures complex dependencies in genomic networks, as evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative metrics. An in-depth functional analysis of a generated genome vector shows that its encoded pathways are interconnected, near complete, and ecologically cohesive. On the test set, where the model's ability to reconstruct uncorrupted genome vectors was evaluated, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) and F1 scores of 0.98 and 0.83, respectively, support the model's strong performance.

    "abstract": "Proteins are small yet valuable biomolecules that play a versatile role in therapeutics and diagnostics. The intricate sequence-structure-function paradigm in the realm of proteins opens the possibility for directly mapping amino acid sequence to function. However, the rugged nature of the protein fitness landscape and an astronomical number of possible mutations even for small proteins make navigating this system a daunting task. Moreover, the scarcity of functional proteins and the ease with which deleterious mutations are introduced, due to complex epistatic relationships, compound the existing challenges. This highlights the need for auxiliary tools in current techniques such as rational design and directed evolution. To that end, the state-of-the-art machine learning can offer time and cost efficiency in finding high fitness proteins, circumventing unnecessary wet-lab experiments. In the context of improving library design, machine learning provides valuable insights via its unique features such as high adaptation to complex systems, multi-tasking, and parallelism, and the ability to capture hidden trends in input data. Finally, both the advancements in computational resources and the rapidly increasing number of sequences in protein databases will allow more promising and detailed insights delivered from machine learning to protein library design. In this chapter, fundamental concepts and a method for machine learning-driven library design leveraging deep sequencing datasets will be discussed. We elaborate on (1) basic knowledge about machine learning algorithms, (2) the benefit of machine learning in library design, and (3) methodology for implementing machine learning in library design.",

Accurate extraction of this information is essential to mineral management and environmental protection. In recent years, there are an increasingly large number of pieces of research on land surface information classification by conducting multi-source remote sensing data. However, in order to achieve the best classification result, how to select the optimal feature combination is the key issue. This study creatively combines Out of Bag data with Recursive Feature Elimination (OOB RFE) to optimize the feature combination of the mineral exploiting information of non-metallic building materials in Fujian province, China. We acquired and integrated Ziyuan-1-02D (ZY-1-02D) hyperspectral imagery, landsat-8 multispectral imagery, and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to gain spectrum, heat, polarization, and texture features; also, two machine learning methods were adopted to classify the mineral exploiting information in our study area. After assessment and comparison on accuracy, it proves that the classification generated from our new OOB RFE method, which combine with random forest (RF), can achieve the highest overall accuracy 93.64% (with a kappa coefficient of 0.926). Comparing with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) alone, OOB REF can precisely filter the feature combination and lead to optimal result. Under the same feature scheme, RF is effective on classifying the mineral exploiting information of the research field. The feature optimization method and optimal feature combination proposed in our study can provide technical support and theoretical reference for extraction and classification of mineral exploiting information applied in other regions.",

    "abstract": "approaches have acquired a towering role in pharmaceutical research and development, allowing laboratories all around the world to design, create, and optimize novel molecular entities with unprecedented efficiency. From a toxicological perspective, computational methods have guided the choices of medicinal chemists toward compounds displaying improved safety profiles. Even if the recent advances in the field are significant, many challenges remain active in the on-target and off-target prediction fields. Machine learning methods have shown their ability to identify molecules with safety concerns. However, they strongly depend on the abundance and diversity of data used for their training. Sharing such information among pharmaceutical companies remains extremely limited due to confidentiality reasons, but in this scenario, a recent concept named \"federated learning\" can help overcome such concerns. Within this framework, it is possible for companies to contribute to the training of common machine learning algorithms, using, but not sharing, their proprietary data. Very recently, Lhasa Limited organized a hackathon involving several industrial partners in order to assess the performance of their federated learning platform, called \"Effiris\". In this paper, we share our experience as Roche in participating in such an event, evaluating the performance of the federated algorithms and comparing them with those coming from our in-house-only machine learning models. Our aim is to highlight the advantages of federated learning and its intrinsic limitations and also suggest some points for potential improvements in the method.",

    "title": "Nonnegative/Binary matrix factorization with a D-Wave quantum annealer.",
    "abstract": "D-Wave quantum annealers represent a novel computational architecture and have attracted significant interest. Much of this interest has focused on the quantum behavior of D-Wave machines, and there have been few practical algorithms that use the D-Wave. Machine learning has been identified as an area where quantum annealing may be useful. Here, we show that the D-Wave 2X can be effectively used as part of an unsupervised machine learning method. This method takes a matrix as input and produces two low-rank matrices as output-one containing latent features in the data and another matrix describing how the features can be combined to approximately reproduce the input matrix. Despite the limited number of bits in the D-Wave hardware, this method is capable of handling a large input matrix. The D-Wave only limits the rank of the two output matrices. We apply this method to learn the features from a set of facial images and compare the performance of the D-Wave to two classical tools. This method is able to learn facial features and accurately reproduce the set of facial images. The performance of the D-Wave shows some promise, but has some limitations. It outperforms the two classical codes in a benchmark when only a short amount of computational time is allowed (200-20,000 microseconds), but these results suggest heuristics that would likely outperform the D-Wave in this benchmark.",

    "title": "Bridging the gap between mechanistic biological models and machine learning surrogates.",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic models have been used for centuries to describe complex interconnected processes, including biological ones. As the scope of these models has widened, so have their computational demands. This complexity can limit their suitability when running many simulations or when real-time results are required. Surrogate machine learning (ML) models can be used to approximate the behaviour of complex mechanistic models, and once built, their computational demands are several orders of magnitude lower. This paper provides an overview of the relevant literature, both from an applicability and a theoretical perspective. For the latter, the paper focuses on the design and training of the underlying ML models. Application-wise, we show how ML surrogates have been used to approximate different mechanistic models. We present a perspective on how these approaches can be applied to models representing biological processes with potential industrial applications (e.g., metabolism and whole-cell modelling) and show why surrogate ML models may hold the key to making the simulation of complex biological systems possible using a typical desktop computer.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that pervasively interferes with the lives of individuals starting in childhood. . To address the subjectivity of current diagnostic approaches, many studies have been dedicated to efforts to identify the differences between ADHD and neurotypical (NT) individuals using electroencephalography (EEG) and continuous performance tests (CPT). . In this study, we proposed EEG-based long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that utilize deep learning techniques with learning the cognitive state transition to discriminate between ADHD and NT children via EEG signal processing. A total of 30 neurotypical children and 30 ADHD children participated in CPT tests while being monitored with EEG. Several architectures of deep and machine learning were applied to three EEG data segments including resting state, cognitive execution, and a period containing a fusion of those. . The experimental results indicated that EEG-based LSTM networks produced the best performance with an average accuracy of 90.50 ± 0.81% in comparison with the deep neural networks, the convolutional neural networks, and the support vector machines with learning the cognitive state transition of EEG data. Novel observations of individual neural markers showed that the beta power activity of the O1 and O2 sites contributed the most to the classifications, subjects exhibited decreased beta power in the ADHD group, and had larger decreases during cognitive execution. . These findings showed that the proposed EEG-based LSTM networks are capable of extracting the varied temporal characteristics of high-resolution electrophysiological signals to differentiate between ADHD and NT children, and brought a new insight to facilitate the diagnosis of ADHD.

    "title": "Calibrating Deep Learning Classifiers for Patient-Independent Electroencephalogram Seizure Forecasting.",
    "abstract": "The recent scientific literature abounds in proposals of seizure forecasting methods that exploit machine learning to automatically analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Deep learning algorithms seem to achieve a particularly remarkable performance, suggesting that the implementation of clinical devices for seizure prediction might be within reach. However, most of the research evaluated the robustness of automatic forecasting methods through randomized cross-validation techniques, while clinical applications require much more stringent validation based on patient-independent testing. In this study, we show that automatic seizure forecasting can be performed, to some extent, even on independent patients who have never been seen during the training phase, thanks to the implementation of a simple calibration pipeline that can fine-tune deep learning models, even on a single epileptic event recorded from a new patient. We evaluate our calibration procedure using two datasets containing EEG signals recorded from a large cohort of epileptic subjects, demonstrating that the forecast accuracy of deep learning methods can increase on average by more than 20%, and that performance improves systematically in all independent patients. We further show that our calibration procedure works best for deep learning models, but can also be successfully applied to machine learning algorithms based on engineered signal features. Although our method still requires at least one epileptic event per patient to calibrate the forecasting model, we conclude that focusing on realistic validation methods allows to more reliably compare different machine learning approaches for seizure prediction, enabling the implementation of robust and effective forecasting systems that can be used in daily healthcare practice.",

    "abstract": "A commentary by Thoemmes on Wiedermann and Sebastian's introductory article on Direction Dependence Analysis (DDA) is responded to in the interest of elaborating and extending direction dependence principles to evaluate causal effect directionality. Considering Thoemmes' observation that some DDA principles are already well-established in machine learning, we argue that several other connections between DDA and research lines in theoretical statistics, econometrics, and quantitative psychology exist, suggesting that DDA is best conceptualized as a framework that summarizes and extends existing knowledge on properties of linear models under non-normality. Further, Thoemmes articulates concerns about assumptions of error distributions used in our main article and presents an artificial data example in which some DDA tests have suboptimal statistical power. We present extensions of DDA to entirely relax distributional assumptions about errors and describe two sensitivity analysis approaches to critically evaluate DDA results. Both sensitivity approaches are illustrated using Thoemmes' artificial data example. Incorporating DDA sensitivity results yields correct causal conclusions. Thus, overall, we stay with our initial conclusion that the use of higher moments in causal inference constitutes an exciting open research area.",

We present predictions of melting points made by several novel machine learning models, previously applied to solubility prediction. Additionally, we make predictions of solubility via the General Solubility Equation (GSE) and monitor the impact of varying the logP prediction model (AlogP and XlogP) on the GSE. We note that the machine learning models presented, using a modest number of 2D descriptors, can make melting point predictions in line with the current state of the art prediction methods (RMSE≥40 °C). We also find that predicted melting points, with an RMSE of tens of degrees Celsius, can be usefully applied to the GSE to yield accurate solubility predictions (log10 S RMSE<1) over a small dataset of drug-like molecules.",

Predicting the vision coordinates while video streaming is important when the network condition is degraded. However, the traditional prediction models such as Moving Average (MA) and Autoregression Moving Average (ARMA) are linear so they cannot consider the nonlinear relationship. Therefore, machine learning models based on deep learning are recently used for nonlinear predictions. We use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network methods, originated in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and predict the head position in the 360-degree videos. Therefore, we adopt the attention model to LSTM to make more accurate results. We also compare the performance of the proposed model with the other machine learning models such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and RNN using the root mean squared error (RMSE) of predicted and real coordinates. We demonstrate that our model can predict the vision coordinates more accurately than the other models in various videos.",

    "abstract": "With the adoption of smart systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become ubiquitous. Conventional ANN implementations have high energy consumption, limiting their use in embedded and mobile applications. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) mimic the dynamics of biological neural networks by distributing information over time through binary spikes. Neuromorphic hardware has emerged to leverage the characteristics of SNNs, such as asynchronous processing and high activation sparsity. Therefore, SNNs have recently gained interest in the machine learning community as a brain-inspired alternative to ANNs for low-power applications. However, the discrete representation of the information makes the training of SNNs by backpropagation-based techniques challenging. In this survey, we review training strategies for deep SNNs targeting deep learning applications such as image processing. We start with methods based on the conversion from an ANN to an SNN and compare these with backpropagation-based techniques. We propose a new taxonomy of spiking backpropagation algorithms into three categories, namely, spatial, spatiotemporal, and single-spike approaches. In addition, we analyze different strategies to improve accuracy, latency, and sparsity, such as regularization methods, training hybridization, and tuning of the parameters specific to the SNN neuron model. We highlight the impact of input encoding, network architecture, and training strategy on the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Finally, in light of the remaining challenges for accurate and efficient SNN solutions, we emphasize the importance of joint hardware-software codevelopment.",

    "title": "Applying Deep Neural Network Analysis to High-Content Image-Based Assays.",
    "abstract": "The etiological underpinnings of many CNS disorders are not well understood. This is likely due to the fact that individual diseases aggregate numerous pathological subtypes, each associated with a complex landscape of genetic risk factors. To overcome these challenges, researchers are integrating novel data types from numerous patients, including imaging studies capturing broadly applicable features from patient-derived materials. These datasets, when combined with machine learning, potentially hold the power to elucidate the subtle patterns that stratify patients by shared pathology. In this study, we interrogated whether high-content imaging of primary skin fibroblasts, using the Cell Painting method, could reveal disease-relevant information among patients. First, we showed that technical features such as batch/plate type, plate, and location within a plate lead to detectable nuisance signals, as revealed by a pre-trained deep neural network and analysis with deep image embeddings. Using a plate design and image acquisition strategy that accounts for these variables, we performed a pilot study with 12 healthy controls and 12 subjects affected by the severe genetic neurological disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and evaluated whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) generated using a subset of the cells could distinguish disease states on cells from the remaining unseen control-SMA pair. Our results indicate that these two populations could effectively be differentiated from one another and that model selectivity is insensitive to batch/plate type. One caveat is that the samples were also largely separated by source. These findings lay a foundation for how to conduct future studies exploring diseases with more complex genetic contributions and unknown subtypes.",

These peptides share common structural and physicochemical properties and show different pharmaceutical applications, among which drug delivery is the most important. Due to their ability to cross the membranes by pulling high-molecular-weight polar molecules, they are termed Trojan horses. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based framework named BChemRF-CPPred (beyond chemical rules-based framework for CPP prediction) that uses an artificial neural network, a support vector machine, and a Gaussian process classifier to differentiate CPPs from non-CPPs, using structure- and sequence-based descriptors extracted from PDB and FASTA formats. The performance of our algorithm was evaluated by tenfold cross-validation and compared with those of previously reported prediction tools using an independent dataset. The BChemRF-CPPred satisfactorily identified CPP-like structures using natural and synthetic modified peptide libraries and also obtained better performance than those of previously reported ML-based algorithms, reaching the independent test accuracy of 90.66% (AUC = 0.9365) for PDB, and an accuracy of 86.5% (AUC = 0.9216) for FASTA input. Moreover, our analyses of the CPP chemical space demonstrated that these peptides break some molecular rules related to the prediction of permeability of therapeutic molecules in cell membranes. This is the first comprehensive analysis to predict synthetic and natural CPP structures and to evaluate their chemical space using an ML-based framework.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have become a major public health problem affecting the national economy and social development, and have become one of the major causes of death. Therefore, the prevention, control and risk assessment of CVD have been increasingly emphasized. However, current CVD prediction models face limitations in capturing complex relationships within physiological data, potentially hindering accurate risk assessment. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel Framework for Multi-Input, One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with Attention Mechanism for CVD (FMI-CAECD). This framework leverages the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) alongside an Attention Mechanism to adaptively identify critical features and non-linear relationships within the data. Additionally, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis is incorporated to provide deeper insights into individual feature importance for disease prediction. Performance evaluation on the BRFSS 2022 dataset demonstrates that FMI-CAECD achieves superior accuracy (97.45%), sensitivity (96.84%), specificity (95.07%), and F1-score (92.44%) compared to traditional machine learning baselines and other deep learning models.

Some electroencephalography (EEG) tasks suffer from low samples-to-features ratio, severely reducing DL effectiveness. DA with DL thus holds transformative promise for EEG processing, possibly like DL revolutionized computer vision, etc. NEW METHOD: We review trends and approaches to DA for DL in EEG to address: Which DA approaches exist and are common for which EEG tasks? What input features are used? And, what kind of accuracy gain can be expected? DA for DL on EEG begun 5 years ago and is steadily used more. We grouped DA techniques (noise addition, generative adversarial networks, sliding windows, sampling, Fourier transform, recombination of segmentation, and others) and EEG tasks (into seizure detection, sleep stages, motor imagery, mental workload, emotion recognition, motor tasks, and visual tasks). DA efficacy across techniques varied considerably. Noise addition and sliding windows provided the highest accuracy boost; mental workload most benefitted from DA. Sliding window, noise addition, and sampling methods most common for seizure detection, mental workload, and sleep stages, respectively. Percent of decoding accuracy explained by DA beyond unaugmented accuracy varied between 8 % for recombination of segmentation and 36 % for noise addition and from 14 % for motor imagery to 56 % for mental workload-29 % on average. DA increasingly used and considerably improved DL decoding accuracy on EEG. Additional publications-if adhering to our reporting guidelines-will facilitate more detailed analysis.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in datasets. Automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models, which require a labelled dataset for their calibration, or unsupervised models, which do not require labels. While academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection, the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive, objective, and systematic. This knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study, where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems. To this end, anomaly detection performance, labelling efforts, as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account. As a result, our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning. Most importantly, our results show that expert-based data annotation is extremely valuable for anomaly detection based on machine learning.",

The selected classifiers techniques can be applied to e-rehabilitation and e-training exercises for different pathologies, as in aphasic patients. The adopted method uses the data from a commercial instrumented glove. An experiment was carried out, where three subjects using an instrumented glove had to grasp eight objects of common use. The collected data were submitted to nineteen different classification techniques (available on the scikit-learn library of Python) used in two classifier structures, with the objective of identifying the grasped object. The data were organized into two dataset scenarios: one with data from the three users and another with individual data. As a result of this work, three classification techniques presented similar accuracies for the classification of objects. Also, it was identified that when training the models with individual dataset the accuracy improves from 96 to 99%. Classification techniques were used in two classifier structures, one based on a single model and the other on a cascade model. For both classifier structure and scenarios, three of the classification techniques were selected due to the high reached accuracies. The highest results were obtained using the classifier structure that employed the cascade models and the scenario of individual dataset.",

    "title": "Representation transfer for differentially private drug sensitivity prediction.",
    "abstract": "Human genomic datasets often contain sensitive information that limits use and sharing of the data. In particular, simple anonymization strategies fail to provide sufficient level of protection for genomic data, because the data are inherently identifiable. Differentially private machine learning can help by guaranteeing that the published results do not leak too much information about any individual data point. Recent research has reached promising results on differentially private drug sensitivity prediction using gene expression data. Differentially private learning with genomic data is challenging because it is more difficult to guarantee privacy in high dimensions. Dimensionality reduction can help, but if the dimension reduction mapping is learned from the data, then it needs to be differentially private too, which can carry a significant privacy cost. Furthermore, the selection of any hyperparameters (such as the target dimensionality) needs to also avoid leaking private information. We study an approach that uses a large public dataset of similar type to learn a compact representation for differentially private learning. We compare three representation learning methods: variational autoencoders, principal component analysis and random projection. We solve two machine learning tasks on gene expression of cancer cell lines: cancer type classification, and drug sensitivity prediction. The experiments demonstrate significant benefit from all representation learning methods with variational autoencoders providing the most accurate predictions most often. Our results significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art in accuracy of differentially private drug sensitivity prediction.

    "abstract": "Individual cells have many unique properties that can be quantified to develop a holistic understanding of a population. This can include understanding population characteristics, identifying subpopulations, or elucidating outlier characteristics that may be indicators of disease. Electrical impedance measurements are rapid and label-free for the monitoring of single cells and generate large datasets of many cells at single or multiple frequencies. To increase the accuracy and sensitivity of measurements and define the relationships between impedance and biological features, many electrical measurement systems have incorporated machine learning (ML) paradigms for control and analysis. Considering the difficulty capturing complex relationships using traditional modelling and statistical methods due to population heterogeneity, ML offers an exciting approach to the systemic collection and analysis of electrical properties in a data-driven way. In this work, we discuss incorporation of ML to improve the field of electrical single cell analysis by addressing the design challenges to manipulate single cells and sophisticated analysis of electrical properties that distinguish cellular changes. Looking forward, we emphasize the opportunity to build on integrated systems to address common challenges in data quality and generalizability to save time and resources at every step in electrical measurement of single cells.",

Data science and specifically machine learning have many applications in gene expression analysis. However, as the dimensionality of genomics datasets grows, scalable solutions become necessary. In this paper we review the main steps and bottlenecks in machine learning pipelines, as well as the main concepts behind scalable data science including those of concurrent and parallel programming. We discuss the benefits of the Dask framework and how it can be integrated with the Python scientific environment to perform data analysis in computational biology and bioinformatics.

Detailed documentation and code on these procedures is made available at https://github.com/martaccmoreno/gexp-ml-dask .

    "title": "Learning from the ligand: using ligand-based features to improve binding affinity prediction.",
    "abstract": "Machine learning scoring functions for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction have been found to consistently outperform classical scoring functions. Structure-based scoring functions for universal affinity prediction typically use features describing interactions derived from the protein-ligand complex, with limited information about the chemical or topological properties of the ligand itself. We demonstrate that the performance of machine learning scoring functions are consistently improved by the inclusion of diverse ligand-based features. For example, a Random Forest (RF) combining the features of RF-Score v3 with RDKit molecular descriptors achieved Pearson correlation coefficients of up to 0.836, 0.780 and 0.821 on the PDBbind 2007, 2013 and 2016 core sets, respectively, compared to 0.790, 0.746 and 0.814 when using the features of RF-Score v3 alone. Excluding proteins and/or ligands that are similar to those in the test sets from the training set has a significant effect on scoring function performance, but does not remove the predictive power of ligand-based features. Furthermore a RF using only ligand-based features is predictive at a level similar to classical scoring functions and it appears to be predicting the mean binding affinity of a ligand for its protein targets.

We and others have previously developed machine-learning algorithms to predict novel effectors. Specifically, given a set of known effectors and a set of known non-effectors, the machine-learning algorithm extracts features that distinguish these two protein groups. In the training phase, the machine learning learns how to best combine the features to separate the two groups. The trained machine learning is then applied to open reading frames (ORFs) with unknown functions, resulting in a score for each ORF, which is its likelihood to be an effector. We developed Effectidor, a web server for predicting type III effectors.

However, for older pharmaceutical products upscaled to commercial phase with Quality by Testing (QbT) approach, the knowhow of the product-specific critical parameters is often limited. In this study, two predictive machine learning (ML) models were used for a commercial tablet product, for which historical data of raw materials, production, in-process controls and condition monitoring were available. With the aforementioned data, the aim was to predict the PSD and the TS that indicate the product quality. The feature importance was used to evaluate the parameter importance for the PSD and the TS. Partial dependence, in turn, was used to estimate the parameter impact on the predicted TS. The study illustrates the capability of the ML models to bring additional value for commercial products through the enhanced product-related knowhow.",

    "abstract": "The greater sciatic notch (GSN) is a useful element for sex estimation because it is quite resistant to damage, and thus it can often be assessed even in poorly preserved skeletons. This study aimed to develop statistical models for sex estimation based on visual and metric analyses of the GSN, and additional variables linked to the GSN. A total of 60 left coxal bones (30 males and 30 females) were analysed. Fifteen variables were measured, and one was a morphologic variable. These 16 variables were used for the comparison of six statistical models: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), penalized logistic regression (PLR) and flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The statistical models were built in two steps: firstly, only with the GSN variables (group 1), and secondly, with the whole variables (group 2), in order to see if the models including all the variables performed better. The overall accuracy of the models was very close, ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 using specific GSN variables. When additional variables starting from the deepest point of GSN are available, it is worth to use them, because the accuracy increases. PLR (after optimization of parameters) stands out from other statistical models. The position of the deepest point of GSN (Fig. 2) probably plays a crucial role for the sexual dimorphism, as stated by the good performance of the visual assessment of this point and the fact that the A2 angle (posterior angle with the deepest point of the GSN as the apex) is included in all models.",

    "title": "A supervised, externally validated machine learning model for artifact and drainage detection in high-resolution intracranial pressure monitoring data.",
    "abstract": "In neurocritical care, data from multiple biosensors are continuously measured, but only sporadically acknowledged by the attending physicians. In contrast, machine learning (ML) tools can analyze large amounts of data continuously, taking advantage of underlying information. However, the performance of such ML-based solutions is limited by different factors, for example, by patient motion, manipulation, or, as in the case of external ventricular drains (EVDs), the drainage of CSF to control intracranial pressure (ICP). The authors aimed to develop an ML-based algorithm that automatically classifies normal signals, artifacts, and drainages in high-resolution ICP monitoring data from EVDs, making the data suitable for real-time artifact removal and for future ML applications. In their 2-center retrospective cohort study, the authors used labeled ICP data from 40 patients in the first neurocritical care unit (University Hospital Zurich) for model development. The authors created 94 descriptive features that were used to train the model. They compared histogram-based gradient boosting with extremely randomized trees after building pipelines with principal component analysis, hyperparameter optimization via grid search, and sequential feature selection. Performance was measured with nested 5-fold cross-validation and multiclass area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Data from 20 patients in a second, independent neurocritical care unit (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin) were used for external validation with bootstrapping technique and AUROC. In cross-validation, the best-performing model achieved a mean AUROC of 0.945 (95% CI 0.92-0.969) on the development dataset. On the external validation dataset, the model performed with a mean AUROC of 0.928 (95% CI 0.908-0.946) in 100 bootstrapping validation cycles to classify normal signals, artifacts, and drainages. Here, the authors developed a well-performing supervised model with external validation that can detect normal signals, artifacts, and drainages in ICP signals from patients in neurocritical care units. For future analyses, this is a powerful tool to discard artifacts or to detect drainage events in ICP monitoring signals.",

    "abstract": "Financial burden caused by cancer treatment is associated with material loss, distress, and poorer outcomes. Financial resources exist to support patients but identification of need is difficult. We sought to develop and test a tool to accurately predict an individual's risk of financial toxicity based on clinical, demographic, and patient-reported data prior to initiation of breast cancer treatment. We surveyed 611 patients undergoing breast cancer therapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We collected data using the validated COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) patient-reported outcome measure alongside other financial indicators (credit score, income, and insurance status). We also collected clinical and perioperative data. We trained and tested an ensemble of machine learning (ML) algorithms (neural network, regularized linear model, support vector machines, and a classification tree) to predict financial toxicity. Data were randomly partitioned into training and test samples (2:1 ratio). Predictive performance was assessed using area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristics-curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In our test sample (N = 203), 48 of 203 women (23.6%) reported significant financial burden. The algorithm ensemble performed well to predict financial burden with an AUROC of 0.85, accuracy of 0.82, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.81. Key clinical predictors of financial burden from the linear model were neoadjuvant therapy (β , .11) and autologous, rather than implant-based, reconstruction (β , .06). Notably, radiation and clinical tumor stage had no effect on financial burden. ML models accurately predicted financial toxicity related to breast cancer treatment. These predictions may inform decision making and care planning to avoid financial distress during cancer treatment or enable targeted financial support. Further research is warranted to validate this tool and assess applicability for other types of cancer.",

Speech deterioration (hypokinetic dysarthria) is a common symptom, which often presents early in the disease course. Machine learning can help movement disorders specialists improve their diagnostic accuracy using non-invasive and inexpensive voice recordings. We used \"Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features Data Set\" from the UCI-Machine Learning repository. The dataset included 44 speech-test based acoustic features from patients with PD and controls. We analyzed the data using various machine learning algorithms including Light and Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighborhood, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, as well as logistic regression. We also implemented a variable importance analysis to identify important variables classifying patients with PD. The cohort included a total of 80 subjects: 40 patients with PD (55% men) and 40 controls (67.5% men). Disease duration was 5 years or less for all subjects, with a mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score of 19.6 (SD 8.1), and none were taking PD medication. The mean age for PD subjects and controls was 69.6 (SD 7.8) and 66.4 (SD 8.4), respectively. Our best-performing model used Light Gradient Boosting to provide an AUC of 0.951 with 95% confidence interval 0.946-0.955 in 4-fold cross validation using only seven acoustic features. Machine learning can accurately detect Parkinson's disease using an inexpensive and non-invasive voice recording. Light Gradient Boosting outperformed other machine learning algorithms.

    "title": "Prediction of microbial phenotypes based on comparative genomics.",
    "abstract": "The accessibility of almost complete genome sequences of uncultivable microbial species from metagenomes necessitates computational methods predicting microbial phenotypes solely based on genomic data. Here we investigate how comparative genomics can be utilized for the prediction of microbial phenotypes. The PICA framework facilitates application and comparison of different machine learning techniques for phenotypic trait prediction. We have improved and extended PICA's support vector machine plug-in and suggest its applicability to large-scale genome databases and incomplete genome sequences. We have demonstrated the stability of the predictive power for phenotypic traits, not perturbed by the rapid growth of genome databases. A new software tool facilitates the in-depth analysis of phenotype models, which associate expected and unexpected protein functions with particular traits. Most of the traits can be reliably predicted in only 60-70% complete genomes. We have established a new phenotypic model that predicts intracellular microorganisms. Thereby we could demonstrate that also independently evolved phenotypic traits, characterized by genome reduction, can be reliably predicted based on comparative genomics. Our results suggest that the extended PICA framework can be used to automatically annotate phenotypes in near-complete microbial genome sequences, as generated in large numbers in current metagenomics studies.",

Advances in enhanced data generation, machine learning algorithms, and compute infrastructure have led to an acceleration in the use of deep learning in various domains of cancer research such as drug response problems. In our study, we explored tree-based models to improve the accuracy of a single drug response model and demonstrate that tree-based models such as XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) have advantages over deep learning models, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), for single drug response problems. However, comparing models is not a trivial task. To make training and comparing CNNs and XGBoost more accessible to users, we developed an open-source library called UNNT (A novel Utility for comparing Neural Net and Tree-based models). The case studies, in this manuscript, focus on cancer drug response datasets however the application can be used on datasets from other domains, such as chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Early on-site diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) will provide the best guidance for clinical practice. However, existing methods and sensors cannot provide sufficiently detailed physical information related to the blunt force impact. In the present work, a smart helmet with a single embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor is developed, which can monitor complex blunt force impact events in real time under both wired and wireless modes. The transient oscillatory signal \"fingerprint\" can specifically reflect the impact-caused physical deformation of the local helmet structure. By combination with machine learning algorithms, the unknown transient impact can be recognized quickly and accurately in terms of impact magnitude, direction, and latitude. Optimization of the training dataset was also validated, and the boosted ML models, such as the S-SVM+ and S-IBK+, are able to predict accurately with complex databases. Thus, the ML-FBG smart helmet system developed by this work may become a crucial intervention alternative during a traumatic brain injury event.",

    "abstract": "The burden of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) is substantial, with approximately 240 million individuals globally unaware of their condition, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Indonesia. Without screening, DM and its complications will impose significant pressure on healthcare systems. Current clinical practices for screening and diagnosing DM primarily involve blood or laboratory-based testing which possess limitations on access and cost. To address these challenges, researchers have developed risk-scoring tools to identify high-risk populations. However, considering generalizability, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a promising approach, leveraging diverse data sources for improved accuracy. AI models (i.e., machine learning and deep learning) have yielded prediction performances of up to 98% in various diseases. This article underscores the potential of AI-driven approaches in reducing the burden of DM through accurate prediction of undiagnosed diabetes while highlighting the need for continued innovation and collaboration in healthcare delivery.",

One of its branches, computer vision, allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20 min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore, CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell (PSC) settings, including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future.",

    "abstract": "How is information processed in the cerebral cortex? In most cases, recorded brain activity is averaged over many (stimulus) repetitions, which erases the fine-structure of the neural signal. However, the brain is obviously a single-trial processor. Thus, we here demonstrate that an unsupervised machine learning approach can be used to extract meaningful information from electro-physiological recordings on a single-trial basis. We use an auto-encoder network to reduce the dimensions of single local field potential (LFP) events to create interpretable clusters of different neural activity patterns. Strikingly, certain LFP shapes correspond to latency differences in different recording channels. Hence, LFP shapes can be used to determine the direction of information flux in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, after clustering, we decoded the cluster centroids to reverse-engineer the underlying prototypical LFP event shapes. To evaluate our approach, we applied it to both extra-cellular neural recordings in rodents, and intra-cranial EEG recordings in humans. Finally, we find that single channel LFP event shapes during spontaneous activity sample from the realm of possible stimulus evoked event shapes.

We used administrative data for 6457 women collected by the Illinois Department of Human Services from July 2014 to May 2015 to develop a machine learning model for adverse birth prediction and improve upon the existing paper-based risk assessment. We compared different models and determined the strongest predictors of adverse birth outcomes using positive predictive value as the metric for selection. Machine learning algorithms performed similarly, outperforming the current paper-based risk assessment by up to 36%; a refined paper-based assessment outperformed the current assessment by up to 22%. We estimate that these improvements will allow 100 to 170 additional high-risk pregnant women screened for program eligibility each year to receive services that would have otherwise been unobtainable. Our analysis exhibits the potential for machine learning to move government agencies toward a more data-informed approach to evaluating risk and providing social services.

This can assist surgeons in clinical decision-making by identifying patient cohorts that will benefit from surgery prior to treatment. The aim of this review is to evaluate the applications of machine learning in plastic and reconstructive surgery. A literature review will be undertaken of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (1990 up to September 2019) to identify studies relevant for the review. Studies in which machine learning has been employed in the clinical setting of plastic surgery will be included. Primary outcomes will be the evaluation of the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting a clinical diagnosis and post-surgical outcomes. Secondary outcomes will include a cost analysis of those models. This protocol has been prepared using the Preferred Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. This will be the first systematic review in available literature that summarises the published work on the applications of machine learning in plastic surgery.

In this article, inspired by the spider silk structure in nature, a novel gesture sensor with a core-shell structure is proposed. The sensor offers a high gauge factor of up to 340 and a wide response range of 60%. Moreover, the sensor combining with a deep learning technique creates a system for precise gesture recognition. The system demonstrated an impressive 99% accuracy in single gesture recognition tests. Meanwhile, by using the sliding window technology and large language model, a high performance of 97% accuracy is achieved in continuous sentence recognition. In summary, the proposed high-performance sensor significantly improves the sensitivity and response range of the gesture recognition sensor. Meanwhile, the neural network technology is combined to further improve the way of daily communication by sign language users.",

    "abstract": "The hard drive is one of the important components of a computing system, and its failure can lead to both system failure and data loss. Therefore, the reliability of a hard drive is very important. Realising this importance, a number of studies have been conducted and many are still ongoing to improve hard drive failure prediction. Most of those studies rely solely on machine learning, and a few others on semantic technology. The studies based on machine learning, despite promising results, lack context-awareness such as how failures are related or what other factors, such as humidity, influence the failure of hard drives. Semantic technology, on the other hand, by means of ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs), is able to provide the context-awareness that machine learning-based studies lack. However, the studies based on semantic technology lack the advantages of machine learning, such as the ability to learn a pattern and make predictions based on learned patterns. Therefore, in this paper, leveraging the benefits of both machine learning (ML) and semantic technology, we present our study, knowledge graph-based hard drive failure prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy in comparison to the current state of the art.",

    "title": "A New Strategy for Disc Cutter Wear Status Perception Using Vibration Detection and Machine Learning.",
    "abstract": "Carrying out status monitoring and fault-diagnosis research on cutter-wear status is of great significance for real-time understanding of the health status of Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) equipment and reducing downtime losses. In this work, we proposed a new method to diagnose the abnormal wear state of the disc cutter by using brain-like artificial intelligence to process and analyze the vibration signal in the dynamic contact between the disc cutter and the rock. This method is mainly aimed at realizing the diagnosis and identification of the abnormal wear state of the cutter, and is not aimed at the accurate measurement of the wear amount. The author believes that when the TBM is operating at full power, the cutting forces are very high and the rock is successively broken, resulting in a complex circumstance, which is inconvenient to vibration signal acquisition and transmission. If only a small thrust is applied, to make the cutters just contact with the rock (less penetration), then the cutters will run more smoothly and suffer less environmental interference, which would be beneficial to apply the method proposed in this paper to detect the state of the cutters. A specific example was to use the frequency-domain characteristics of the periodic vibration waveform during the contact between the cutter and the granite to identify the wear status (including normal wear state, wear failure state, angled wear failure state) of the disc cutter through the artificial neural network, and the diagnosis accuracy rate is 90%.",

The representation of molecules in SMILES notation as a string of characters enables the usage of state of the art models in natural language processing, such as Transformers, for molecular design in general. Inspired by generative pre-training (GPT) models that have been shown to be successful in generating meaningful text, we train a transformer-decoder on the next token prediction task using masked self-attention for the generation of druglike molecules in this study. We show that our model, MolGPT, performs on par with other previously proposed modern machine learning frameworks for molecular generation in terms of generating valid, unique, and novel molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can be trained conditionally to control multiple properties of the generated molecules. We also show that the model can be used to generate molecules with desired scaffolds as well as desired molecular properties by conditioning the generation on scaffold SMILES strings of desired scaffolds and property values. Using saliency maps, we highlight the interpretability of the generative process of the model.",

    "abstract": "The design of a metasurface array consisting of different unit cells with the objective of minimizing its radar cross-section is a popular research topic. Currently, this is achieved by conventional optimisation algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO). One major concern of such algorithms is the extreme time complexity, which makes them computationally forbidden, particularly at large metasurface array size. Here, we apply a machine learning optimisation technique called active learning to significantly speed up the optimisation process while producing very similar results compared to GA. For a metasurface array of size 10 × 10 at a population size of 106, active learning took 65 min to find the optimal design compared to genetic algorithm, which took 13,260 min to return an almost similar optimal result. The active learning optimisation strategy produced an optimal design for a 60 × 60 metasurface array 24× faster than the approximately similar result generated by GA technique. Thus, this study concludes that active learning drastically reduces computational time for optimisation compared to genetic algorithm, particularly for a larger metasurface array. Active learning using an accurately trained surrogate model also contributes to further lowering of the computational time of the optimisation procedure.",

    "title": "Toward the explainability, transparency, and universality of machine learning for behavioral classification in neuroscience.",
    "abstract": "The use of rigorous ethological observation via machine learning techniques to understand brain function (computational neuroethology) is a rapidly growing approach that is poised to significantly change how behavioral neuroscience is commonly performed. With the development of open-source platforms for automated tracking and behavioral recognition, these approaches are now accessible to a wide array of neuroscientists despite variations in budget and computational experience. Importantly, this adoption has moved the field toward a common understanding of behavior and brain function through the removal of manual bias and the identification of previously unknown behavioral repertoires. Although less apparent, another consequence of this movement is the introduction of analytical tools that increase the explainabilty, transparency, and universality of the machine-based behavioral classifications both within and between research groups. Here, we focus on three main applications of such machine model explainabilty tools and metrics in the drive toward behavioral (i) standardization, (ii) specialization, and (iii) explainability. We provide a perspective on the use of explainability tools in computational neuroethology, and detail why this is a necessary next step in the expansion of the field. Specifically, as a possible solution in behavioral neuroscience, we propose the use of Shapley values via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) as a diagnostic resource toward explainability of human annotation, as well as supervised and unsupervised behavioral machine learning analysis.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is a technique for recognizing patterns that can be applied to medical images. Although it is a powerful tool that can help in rendering medical diagnoses, it can be misapplied. Machine learning typically begins with the machine learning algorithm system computing the image features that are believed to be of importance in making the prediction or diagnosis of interest. The machine learning algorithm system then identifies the best combination of these image features for classifying the image or computing some metric for the given image region. There are several methods that can be used, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are open-source versions of most of these machine learning methods that make them easy to try and apply to images. Several metrics for measuring the performance of an algorithm exist; however, one must be aware of the possible associated pitfalls that can result in misleading metrics. More recently, deep learning has started to be used; this method has the benefit that it does not require image feature identification and calculation as a first step; rather, features are identified as part of the learning process. Machine learning has been used in medical imaging and will have a greater influence in the future. Those working in medical imaging must be aware of how machine learning works. RSNA, 2017.",

To directly identify the optimal DTR in a multi-stage multi-treatment setting, we propose a dynamic statistical learning method, adaptive contrast weighted learning. We develop semiparametric regression-based contrasts with the adaptation of treatment effect ordering for each patient at each stage, and the adaptive contrasts simplify the problem of optimization with multiple treatment comparisons to a weighted classification problem that can be solved by existing machine learning techniques. The algorithm is implemented recursively using backward induction. By combining doubly robust semiparametric regression estimators with machine learning algorithms, the proposed method is robust and efficient for the identification of the optimal DTR, as shown in the simulation studies.

However, these types of models are complex and time-consuming to develop. There is great interest in the adoption of machine-learning methods, but most implementations cannot be reliably extrapolated to treatment strategies outside of the training data. In order to solve this problem, we propose the deep compartment model (DCM), a combination of neural networks and ordinary differential equations. Using simulated datasets of different sizes, we show that our model remains accurate when training on small data sets. Furthermore, using a real-world data set of patients with hemophilia A receiving factor VIII concentrate while undergoing surgery, we show that our model more accurately predicts a priori drug concentrations compared to a previous NLME model. In addition, we show that our model correctly describes the changing drug concentration over time. By adopting pharmacokinetic principles, the DCM allows for simulation of different treatment strategies and enables therapeutic drug monitoring.",

    "title": "Prediction of maximum scour depth at clear water conditions: Multivariate and robust comparative analysis between empirical equations and machine learning approaches using extensive reference metadata.",
    "abstract": "Flow obstructed by bridge piers can increase sediment transport leading to local scour. This local scour poses a risk to the stability of bridge structures, which could lead to structural failures. There are two main approaches for evaluating the scour depth (d ) of bridge piers. The first is based on understanding hydraulic phenomena and developing relationships with properties affecting scour. The second uses data-driven soft computing models that lack physical interpretations but rely on algorithms to predict outcomes. Methods are chosen by researchers based on their goals and resources. This study aims to create innovative ensemble frameworks comprising support vector machine for regression (SVMR), random forest regression (RFR), and reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) as base learners, alongside bagging regression tree (BRT) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) as meta learners. These ensembles were developed to analyse maximum scour depths (d ) in clear water conditions, utilizing 35 literature's experimental data published in last 63 years. The performance of each machine learning (ML) approach was assessed using statistical performance indicators. The proposed model was also compared with top six empirical equations with strong predictive ability. Results show that among these empirical equations, the equation from Nandi and Das (2023) performs best. Performance evaluation considering training, testing, and the entire dataset, SGB (REPTree), BRT(SVMR-PUK), and SGB (REPTree) exhibited the highest performance, securing the top rank among all ML models and empirical equations. Sensitivity analysis identified sediment gradation and flow intensity as the most influential variables for predicting d during both training and testing phases, respectively.",

    "abstract": "As synthetic biology expands and accelerates into real-world applications, methods for quantitatively and precisely engineering biological function become increasingly relevant. This is particularly true for applications that require programmed sensing to dynamically regulate gene expression in response to stimuli. However, few methods have been described that can engineer biological sensing with any level of quantitative precision. Here, we present two complementary methods for precision engineering of genetic sensors: in silico selection and machine-learning-enabled forward engineering. Both methods use a large-scale genotype-phenotype dataset to identify DNA sequences that encode sensors with quantitatively specified dose response. First, we show that in silico selection can be used to engineer sensors with a wide range of dose-response curves. To demonstrate in silico selection for precise, multi-objective engineering, we simultaneously tune a genetic sensor's sensitivity (EC50) and saturating output to meet quantitative specifications. In addition, we engineer sensors with inverted dose-response and specified EC50. Second, we demonstrate a machine-learning-enabled approach to predictively engineer genetic sensors with mutation combinations that are not present in the large-scale dataset. We show that the interpretable machine learning results can be combined with a biophysical model to engineer sensors with improved inverted dose-response curves.",

There is an inherent difficulty in extracting the necessary parameters, because the experiments often yield an insufficient quantity of information. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to combine real experiments, numerical simulation, and Machine Learning (ML) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), aiming at a reliable identification of the physical model factors, e.g. the killing action of the drug. To this purpose, we exploit the employed mathematical-numerical model for tumor growth and drug delivery, together with the ANN - ML procedure, to integrate the results of the experimental tests and feed back the model itself, thus obtaining a reliable predictive tool. The procedure represents a hybrid data-driven, physics-informed approach to machine learning.

    "title": "An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Image-based Texture Features Extracted from Static B-mode Ultrasound Images in Distinguishing between Benign and Malignant Ovarian Masses.",
    "abstract": "Significant successes in machine learning approaches to image analysis for various applications have energized strong interest in automated diagnostic support systems for medical images. The evolving in-depth understanding of the way carcinogenesis changes the texture of cellular networks of a mass/tumor has been informing such diagnostics systems with use of more suitable image texture features and their extraction methods. Several texture features have been recently applied in discriminating malignant and benign ovarian masses by analysing B-mode images from ultrasound scan of the ovary with different levels of performance. However, comparative performance evaluation of these reported features using common sets of clinically approved images is lacking. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of seven commonly used texture features (histograms, moments of histogram, local binary patterns [256-bin and 59-bin], histograms of oriented gradients, fractal dimensions, and Gabor filter), using a collection of 242 ultrasound scan images of ovarian masses of various pathological characteristics. The evaluation examines not only the effectiveness of classification schemes based on the individual texture features but also the effectiveness of various combinations of these schemes using the simple majority-rule decision level fusion. Trained support vector machine classifiers on the individual texture features without any specific pre-processing, achieve levels of accuracy between 75% and 85% where the seven moments and the 256-bin LBP are at the lower end while the Gabor filter is at the upper end. Combining the classification results of the top ( = 3, 5, 7) best performing features further improve the overall accuracy to a level between 86% and 90%. These evaluation results demonstrate that each of the investigated image-based texture features provides informative support in distinguishing benign or malignant ovarian masses.",

    "title": "Applying interpretable deep learning models to identify chronic cough patients using EHR data.",
    "abstract": "Chronic cough (CC) affects approximately 10% of adults. Many disease states are associated with chronic cough, such as asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The lack of an ICD code specific for chronic cough makes it challenging to identify such patients from electronic health records (EHRs). For clinical and research purposes, computational methods using EHR data are urgently needed to identify chronic cough cases. This research aims to investigate the data representations and deep learning algorithms for chronic cough prediction. Utilizing real-world EHR data from a large academic healthcare system from October 2005 to September 2015, we investigated Natural Language Representation of the EHR data and systematically evaluated deep learning and traditional machine learning models to predict chronic cough patients. We built these machine learning models using structured data (medication and diagnosis) and unstructured data (clinical notes). The sensitivity and specificity of a transformer-based deep learning algorithm, specifically BERT with attention model, was 0.856 and 0.866, respectively, using structured data (medication and diagnosis). Sensitivity and specificity improved to 0.952 and 0.930 when we combined structured data with symptoms extracted from clinical notes. We further found that the attention mechanism of deep learning models can be used to extract important features that drive the prediction decisions. Compared with our previously published rule-based algorithm, the deep learning algorithm can identify more chronic cough patients with structured data. By applying deep learning models, chronic cough patients can be reliably identified for prospective or retrospective research through medication and diagnosis data, widely available in EHR and electronic claims data, thus improving the generalizability of the patient identification algorithm. Deep learning models can identify chronic cough patients with even higher sensitivity and specificity when structured and unstructured EHR data are utilized. We anticipate language-based data representation and deep learning models developed in this research could also be productively used for other disease prediction and case identification.",

Hence, overcoming capping propensity based on the understanding of suitable process and material parameters is of utmost importance to expedite drug product development. In the present work, 26 diverse formulations were characterized at commercial tableting condition to identify key tablet properties influencing capping propensity, and a predictive model based on threshold properties was established using machine learning and multivariate tools. It was found that both the compaction parameters (i.e., compaction pressure, radial stress transmission characteristics, and Poisson's ratio), and the material properties, (i.e., brittleness, yield strength, particle bonding strength and elastic recovery) strongly dictate the capping propensity of a tablet. In addition, ratio of elastic modulus in the orthogonal direction in a tablet and its variation with porosity were notable quantitative metrics of capping occurrence.",

The advantages and disadvantages of current analytical strategies in contemporary basic science and epidemiological research are reviewed and we consider how analytical machine learning approaches could provide the platform to harness the variability of patient presentations to enhance clinical prediction of pain persistence or recurrence.

    "abstract": "Biopharmaceutical drug discovery, as of today is a highly automated, high throughput endeavor, where many screening technologies produce a high-dimensional measurement per sample. A striking example is High Content Screening (HCS), which utilizes automated microscopy to systematically access the wealth of information contained in biological assays. Exploiting HCS to its full potential traditionally requires extracting a high number of features from the images to capture as much information as possible, then performing algorithmic analysis and complex data visualization in order to render this high-dimensional data into an interpretable and instructive information for guiding drug development. In this process, automated feature selection methods condense the feature set to reduce non-useful or redundant information and render it more meaningful. We compare 12 state-of-the-art feature selection methods (both supervised and unsupervised) by systematically testing them on two HCS datasets from drug screening imaging assays of high practical relevance. Considering as evaluation metrics standard plate-, assay- or compound statistics on the final results, we assess the generalizability and importance of the selected features by use of automated machine learning (AutoML) to achieve an unbiased evaluation across methods. Results provide practical guidance on experiment design, optimal sizing of a reduced feature set and choice of feature selection method, both in situations where useful experimental control states are available (enabling use of supervised algorithms) or where such controls are unavailable, using unsupervised techniques.",

    "title": "Machine learning in GI endoscopy: practical guidance in how to interpret a novel field.",
    "abstract": "There has been a vast increase in GI literature focused on the use of machine learning in endoscopy. The relative novelty of this field poses a challenge for reviewers and readers of GI journals. To appreciate scientific quality and novelty of machine learning studies, understanding of the technical basis and commonly used techniques is required. Clinicians often lack this technical background, while machine learning experts may be unfamiliar with clinical relevance and implications for daily practice. Therefore, there is an increasing need for a multidisciplinary, international evaluation on how to perform high-quality machine learning research in endoscopy. This review aims to provide guidance for readers and reviewers of peer-reviewed GI journals to allow critical appraisal of the most relevant quality requirements of machine learning studies. The paper provides an overview of common trends and their potential pitfalls and proposes comprehensive quality requirements in six overarching themes: terminology, data, algorithm description, experimental setup, interpretation of results and machine learning in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Machine Learning-Based Plant Detection Algorithms to Automate Counting Tasks Using 3D Canopy Scans.",
    "abstract": "This study tested whether machine learning (ML) methods can effectively separate individual plants from complex 3D canopy laser scans as a prerequisite to analyzing particular plant features. For this, we scanned mung bean and chickpea crops with PlantEye (R) laser scanners. Firstly, we segmented the crop canopies from the background in 3D space using the Region Growing Segmentation algorithm. Then, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based ML algorithms were fine-tuned for plant counting. Application of the CNN-based (Convolutional Neural Network) processing architecture was possible only after we reduced the dimensionality of the data to 2D. This allowed for the identification of individual plants and their counting with an accuracy of 93.18% and 92.87% for mung bean and chickpea plants, respectively. These steps were connected to the phenotyping pipeline, which can now replace manual counting operations that are inefficient, costly, and error-prone. The use of CNN in this study was innovatively solved with dimensionality reduction, addition of height information as color, and consequent application of a 2D CNN-based approach. We found there to be a wide gap in the use of ML on 3D information. This gap will have to be addressed, especially for more complex plant feature extractions, which we intend to implement through further research.",

    "abstract": "Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is often more severe than adult-onset SLE and is challenging to diagnose due to its variable presentation and lack of specific diagnostic tests. This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for cSLE by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using machine learning algorithms. In this study, we utilized the Gene Expression Omnibus database to investigate the DEGs between cSLE and normal samples, conducting a functional enrichment analysis on DEGs. Subsequently, we employed machine learning algorithms, including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination, to identify hub DEGs, which serve as crucial biomarkers. We delved into the role of these hub DEGs in the pathogenesis of the disease and the correlation between these hub DEGs and immune infiltration by comprehensive immune infiltration analysis using the CIBERSORT algorithm. We identified 110 DEGs in cSLE, including 95 upregulated and 15 downregulated genes. Functional annotation revealed that these DEGs were involved in immune response processes, viral defense mechanisms, and regulation of interferon responses. Machine learning algorithms identified CCR1 and SAMD9L as hub DEGs, which were validated in multiple datasets and demonstrated high diagnostic value for cSLE. Mechanistic exploration suggested that CCR1 and SAMD9L are involved in immune response modulation, particularly in interferon signaling and the innate immune system. Assessment of immune cell infiltration revealed significant differences in immune cell composition between cSLE patients and healthy controls, with cSLE patients exhibiting a higher proportion of neutrophils. Moreover, CCR1 and SAMD9L expression levels showed positive correlations with neutrophil infiltration and other immune cell types. CCR1 and SAMD9L were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers for cSLE using machine learning and were validated in multiple datasets. These findings provide novel insights into the biological underpinnings of cSLE.",

Our system makes use of latest NLP methods with a large number of engineered features including some based on pre-trained word embedding. Our final model achieved satisfactory performance in the Document Triage Task of the BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track with highest recall and comparable F1-score. The performance of our method indicates that it is ideally suited for being combined with manual annotations. Our machine learning framework and engineered features will also be very helpful for other researchers to further improve this and other related biological text mining tasks using either traditional machine learning or deep learning based methods.",

    "title": "Robust graph structure learning under heterophily.",
    "abstract": "A graph is a fundamental mathematical structure in characterizing relations between different objects and has been widely used on various learning tasks. Most methods implicitly assume a given graph to be accurate and complete. However, real data is inevitably noisy and sparse, which will lead to inferior results in downstream tasks, such as node classification and clustering. Despite the remarkable success of recent graph representation learning methods, they inherently presume that the graph is homophilic, and largely overlook heterophily, where most connected nodes are from different classes. In this regard, we propose a novel robust graph structure learning method to achieve a high-quality graph from heterophilic data for downstream tasks. We first apply a high-pass filter to make each node more distinctive from its neighbors by encoding structure information into the node features. Then, we learn a robust graph with an adaptive norm characterizing different levels of noise. Afterwards, we propose a novel regularizer to further refine the graph structure. Clustering and semi-supervised classification experiments on heterophilic graphs verify the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our simple method can have better performance than fancy deep learning methods in handling heterophilic graphs by delivering superior accuracy.",

    "title": "Non-Deep Active Learning for Deep Neural Networks.",
    "abstract": "One way to improve annotation efficiency is active learning. The goal of active learning is to select images from many unlabeled images, where labeling will improve the accuracy of the machine learning model the most. To select the most informative unlabeled images, conventional methods use deep neural networks with a large number of computation nodes and long computation time, but we propose a non-deep neural network method that does not require any additional training for unlabeled image selection. The proposed method trains a task model on labeled images, and then the model predicts unlabeled images. Based on this prediction, an uncertainty indicator is generated for each unlabeled image. Images with a high uncertainty index are considered to have a high information content, and are selected for annotation. Our proposed method is based on a very simple and powerful idea: select samples near the decision boundary of the model. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than conventional active learning methods on multiple tasks and up to 14 times faster execution time from 1.2 × 106 s to 8.3 × 104 s. The proposed method outperforms the current SoTA method by 1% accuracy on CIFAR-10.",

    "abstract": "RNA-protein interaction (RPI) is crucial to the life processes of diverse organisms. Various researchers have identified RPI through long-term and high-cost biological experiments. Although numerous machine learning and deep learning-based methods for predicting RPI currently exist, their robustness and generalizability have significant room for improvement. This study proposes LPI-MFF, an RPI prediction model based on multi-source information fusion, to address these issues. The LPI-MFF employed protein-protein interactions features, sequence features, secondary structure features, and physical and chemical properties as the information sources with the corresponding coding scheme, followed by the random forest algorithm for feature screening. Finally, all information was combined and a classification method based on convolutional neural networks is used. The experimental results of fivefold cross-validation demonstrated that the accuracy of LPI-MFF on RPI1807 and NPInter was 97.60% and 97.67%, respectively. In addition, the accuracy rate on the independent test set RPI1168 was 84.9%, and the accuracy rate on the Mus musculus dataset was 90.91%. Accordingly, LPI-MFF demonstrated greater robustness and generalization than other prevalent RPI prediction methods.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in digital and precision medicine have fostered the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including machine learning, artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning, within the field of dentistry, particularly in imaging diagnosis and treatment. This review examines the progress of AI across various domains of dentistry, focusing on its role in enhancing diagnostics and optimizing treatment for oral diseases such as endodontic disease, periodontal disease, oral implantology, orthodontics, prosthodontic treatment, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. Additionally, it discusses the emerging opportunities and challenges associated with these technologies. The findings indicate that AI can be effectively utilized in numerous aspects of oral healthcare, including prevention, early screening, accurate diagnosis, treatment plan design assistance, treatment execution, follow-up monitoring, and prognosis assessment. However, notable challenges persist, including issues related to inaccurate data annotation, limited capability for fine-grained feature expression, a lack of universally applicable models, potential biases in learning algorithms, and legal risks pertaining to medical malpractice and data privacy breaches. Looking forward, future research is expected to concentrate on overcoming these challenges to enhance the accuracy and applicability of AI in diagnosing and treating oral diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in dentistry and to identify pathways for its effective integration into clinical practice.",

    "title": "Accelerating bioactive peptide discovery via mutual information-based meta-learning.",
    "abstract": "Recently, machine learning methods have been developed to identify various peptide bio-activities. However, due to the lack of experimentally validated peptides, machine learning methods cannot provide a sufficiently trained model, easily resulting in poor generalizability. Furthermore, there is no generic computational framework to predict the bioactivities of different peptides. Thus, a natural question is whether we can use limited samples to build an effective predictive model for different kinds of peptides. To address this question, we propose Mutual Information Maximization Meta-Learning (MIMML), a novel meta-learning-based predictive model for bioactive peptide discovery. Using few samples from various functional peptides, MIMML can sufficiently learn the discriminative information amongst various functions and characterize functional differences. Experimental results show excellent performance of MIMML though using far fewer training samples as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also decipher the latent relationships among different kinds of functions to understand what meta-model learned to improve a specific task. In summary, this study is a pioneering work in the field of functional peptide mining and provides the first-of-its-kind solution for few-sample learning problems in biological sequence analysis, accelerating the new functional peptide discovery.

Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly advancing field with increasing utility in predicting PPD risk. We aimed to synthesize and evaluate the quality of studies on application of ML techniques in predicting PPD risk. We conducted a systematic search of eight databases, identifying English and Chinese studies on ML techniques for predicting PPD risk and ML techniques with performance metrics. Quality of the studies involved was evaluated using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Seventeen studies involving 62 prediction models were included. Supervised learning was the main ML technique employed and the common ML models were support vector machine, random forest and logistic regression. Five studies (30 %) reported both internal and external validation. Two studies involved model translation, but none were tested clinically. All studies showed a high risk of bias, and more than half showed high application risk. Including Chinese articles slightly reduced the reproducibility of the review. Model performance was not quantitatively analyzed owing to inconsistent metrics and the absence of methods for correlation meta-analysis. Researchers have paid more attention to model development than to validation, and few have focused on improvement and innovation. Models for predicting PPD risk continue to emerge. However, few have achieved the acceptable quality standards. Therefore, ML techniques for successfully predicting PPD risk are yet to be deployed in clinical environments.",

    "abstract": "UV-generated hydrated electrons play a critical role in the defluorination reaction of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). However, limited experimental data hinder insight into the effects of the structural characteristics of emerging PFAS on their defluorination abilities. Therefore, in this study, we adopted quantity structure-activity relationship models based on machine learning algorithms to develop the predictive models of the relative defluorination ability of PFAS. Five-fold cross-validations were used to perform the hyperparameter tuning of the models, which suggested that the gradient boosting algorithms with PaDEL descriptors as the best model possessed superior predictive performance (R = 0.944 and RMSE = 0.114). The importance of the descriptor indicated that the electrostatic properties and topological structure of the compounds significantly affected the defluorination ability of the PFAS. For the emerging PFAS the best model showed that most compounds, such as potential alternatives of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, were recalcitrant to reductive defluorination, whereas perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids had relatively stronger defluorination abilities than perfluorooctanoic acid. The theoretical calculations implied that additional electrons on PFAS could cause molecular deconstruction, such as changes in the dihedral angle involved in the carbon chain, as well as C-F bond and ether C-O bond cleavages. In general, the current computational models could be useful for screening emerging PFAS to assess their defluorination ability for the molecular design of fluorochemical structures.",

    "abstract": "The use of software and IoT services is increasing significantly among people with special needs, who constitute 15% of the world's population. However, selecting appropriate services to create a composite assistive service based on the evolving needs and context of disabled user groups remains a challenging research endeavor. Our research applies a scenario-based design technique to contribute (1) an inclusive disability ontology for assistive service selection, (2) semi-synthetic generated disability service datasets, and (3) a machine learning (ML) framework to choose services adaptively to suit the dynamic requirements of people with special needs. The ML-based selection framework is applied in two complementary phases. In the first phase, all available atomic tasks are assessed to determine their appropriateness to the user goal and profiles, whereas in the subsequent phase, the list of service providers is narrowed by matching their quality-of-service factors against the context and characteristics of the disabled person. Our methodology is centered around a myriad of user characteristics, including their disability profile, preferences, environment, and available IT resources. To this end, we extended the widely used QWS V2.0 and WS-DREAM web services datasets with a fusion of selected accessibility features. To ascertain the validity of our approach, we compared its performance against common multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models, namely AHP, SAW, PROMETHEE, and TOPSIS. The findings demonstrate superior service selection accuracy in contrast to the other methods while ensuring accessibility requirements are satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Poly-drug therapy is now recognized as a crucial treatment, and the analysis of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) offers substantial theoretical support and guidance for its implementation. Predicting potential DDIs using intelligent algorithms is an emerging approach in pharmacological research. However, the existing supervised models and deep learning-based techniques still have several limitations. This paper proposes a novel DDI analysis and prediction framework called the Multi-View Semi-supervised Graph-based (MVSG) framework, which provides a comprehensive judgment by integrating multiple DDI features and functions without any time-consuming training process. Unlike conventional approaches, MVSG can search for the most suitable similarity (or distance) measurement among DDI data and construct graph structures for each feature. By employing a parameter self-tuning strategy, MVSG fuses multiple graphs according to the contributions of features' information. The actual anticancer drug data are extracted from the authoritative public database for evaluating the effectiveness of our framework, including 904 drugs, 7730 DDI records and 19 types of drug interactions. Validation results indicate that the prediction is more accurate when multiple features are adopted by our framework. In comparison to conventional machine learning techniques, MVSG can achieve higher performance even with less labeled data and without a training process. Finally, MVSG is employed to narrow down the search for potential valuable combinations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified machine learning model (UMLM) for two-class classification, regression and outlier (or novelty) detection via a robust optimization approach. The model embraces various machine learning models such as support vector machine-based and minimax probability machine-based classification and regression models. The unified framework makes it possible to compare and contrast existing learning models and to explain their differences and similarities. In this paper, after relating existing learning models to UMLM, we show some theoretical properties for UMLM. Concretely, we show an interpretation of UMLM as minimizing a well-known financial risk measure (worst-case value-at risk (VaR) or conditional VaR), derive generalization bounds for UMLM using such a risk measure, and prove that solving problems of UMLM leads to estimators with the minimized generalization bounds. Those theoretical properties are applicable to related existing learning models.",

    "title": "Improving the Performance of Electrotactile Brain-Computer Interface Using Machine Learning Methods on Multi-Channel Features of Somatosensory Event-Related Potentials.",
    "abstract": "Traditional tactile brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly those based on steady-state somatosensory-evoked potentials, face challenges such as lower accuracy, reduced bit rates, and the need for spatially distant stimulation points. In contrast, using transient electrical stimuli offers a promising alternative for generating tactile BCI control signals: somatosensory event-related potentials (sERPs). This study aimed to optimize the performance of a novel electrotactile BCI by employing advanced feature extraction and machine learning techniques on sERP signals for the classification of users' selective tactile attention. The experimental protocol involved ten healthy subjects performing a tactile attention task, with EEG signals recorded from five EEG channels over the sensory-motor cortex. We employed sequential forward selection (SFS) of features from temporal sERP waveforms of all EEG channels. We systematically tested classification performance using machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks. We explored the effects of the number of stimuli required to obtain sERP features for classification and their influence on accuracy and information transfer rate. Our approach indicated significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to previous studies. We demonstrated that the number of stimuli for sERP generation can be reduced while increasing the information transfer rate without a statistically significant decrease in classification accuracy. In the case of the support vector machine classifier, we achieved a mean accuracy over 90% for 10 electrical stimuli, while for 6 stimuli, the accuracy decreased by less than 7%, and the information transfer rate increased by 60%. This research advances methods for tactile BCI control based on event-related potentials. This work is significant since tactile stimulation is an understudied modality for BCI control, and electrically induced sERPs are the least studied control signals in reactive BCIs. Exploring and optimizing the parameters of sERP elicitation, as well as feature extraction and classification methods, is crucial for addressing the accuracy versus speed trade-off in various assistive BCI applications where the tactile modality may have added value.",

    "abstract": "Toxicopathological images acquired during safety assessment elucidate an individual's biological responses to a given compound, and their numerization can yield valuable insights contributing to the assessment of compound properties. Currently, toxicopathological images are mainly encoded as pathological findings, evaluated by pathologists, which introduces challenges when used as input for modeling, specifically in terms of representation capability and comparability. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of latent representations extracted from toxicopathological images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in estimating compound properties in vivo. Special emphasis was placed on examining the impact of learning pathological findings, the depth of frozen layers during learning, and the selection of the layer for latent representation. Our findings demonstrate that a machine learning model fed with the latent representation as input surpassed the performance of a model directly employing pathological findings as input, particularly in the classification of a compound's Mechanism of Action and in predicting late-phase findings from early-phase images in repeated-dose tests. While learning pathological findings did improve accuracy, the magnitude of improvement was relatively modest. Similarly, the effect of freezing layers during learning was also limited. Notably, the selection of the layer for latent representation had a substantial impact on the accurate estimation of compound properties in vivo.",

    "title": "Novel deep neural network based pattern field classification architectures.",
    "abstract": "Field classification is a new extension of traditional classification frameworks that attempts to utilize consistent information from a group of samples (termed fields). By forgoing the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, field classification can achieve remarkably improved accuracy compared to traditional classification methods. Most studies of field classification have been conducted on traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, we propose integration with a Bayesian framework, for the first time, in order to extend field classification to deep learning and propose two novel deep neural network architectures: the Field Deep Perceptron (FDP) and the Field Deep Convolutional Neural Network (FDCNN). Specifically, we exploit a deep perceptron structure, typically a 6-layer structure, where the first 3 layers remove (learn) a 'style' from a group of samples to map them into a more discriminative space and the last 3 layers are trained to perform classification. For the FDCNN, we modify the AlexNet framework by adding style transformation layers within the hidden layers. We derive a novel learning scheme from a Bayesian framework and design a novel and efficient learning algorithm with guaranteed convergence for training the deep networks. The whole framework is interpreted with visualization features showing that the field deep neural network can better learn the style of a group of samples. Our developed models are also able to achieve transfer learning and learn transformations for newly introduced fields. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on benchmark data (including face, speech, and handwriting data) to validate our learning approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed deep frameworks achieve significant improvements over other state-of-the-art algorithms, attaining new benchmark performance.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical predictive coding (hPC) provides a compelling framework for understanding how the cortex predicts future sensory inputs by minimizing prediction errors through an internal generative model of the external world. Existing deep learning models inspired by hPC incorporate architectural choices that deviate from core hPC principles, potentially limiting their utility for neuroscientific investigations. We introduce PrediRep (Predicting Representations), a novel deep learning network that adheres more closely to architectural principles of hPC. We validate PrediRep by comparing its functional alignment with hPC to that of existing models after being trained on a next-frame prediction task. Our findings demonstrate that PrediRep, particularly when trained with an all-level loss function (PrediRepAll), exhibits high functional alignment with hPC. In contrast to other contemporary deep learning networks inspired by hPC, it consistently processes input-relevant information at higher hierarchical levels and maintains active representations and accurate predictions across all hierarchical levels. Although PrediRep was designed primarily to serve as a model suitable for neuroscientific research rather than to optimize performance, it nevertheless achieves competitive performance in next-frame prediction while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters than alternative models. Our results underscore that even minor architectural deviations from neuroscientific theories like hPC can lead to significant functional discrepancies. By faithfully adhering to hPC principles, PrediRep provides a more accurate tool for in silico exploration of cortical phenomena. PrediRep's lightweight and biologically plausible design makes it well-suited for future studies aiming to investigate the neural underpinnings of predictive coding and to derive empirically testable predictions.",

    "title": "A supervised multiclass framework for mineral classification of Iberian beads.",
    "abstract": "Research on personal adornments depends on the reliable characterisation of materials to trace provenance and model complex social networks. However, many analytical techniques require the transfer of materials from the museum to the laboratory, involving high insurance costs and limiting the number of items that can be analysed, making the process of empirical data collection a complicated, expensive and time-consuming routine. In this study, we compiled the largest geochemical dataset of Iberian personal adornments (n = 1243 samples) by coupling X-ray fluorescence compositional data with their respective X-ray diffraction mineral labels. This allowed us to develop a machine learning-based framework for the prediction of bead-forming minerals by training and benchmarking 13 of the most widely used supervised algorithms. As a proof of concept, we developed a multiclass model and evaluated its performance on two assemblages from different Portuguese sites with current mineralogical characterisation: Cova das Lapas (n = 15 samples) and Gruta da Marmota (n = 10 samples). Our results showed that decisión-tres based classifiers outperformed other classification logics given the discriminative importance of some chemical elements in determining the mineral phase, which fits particularly well with the decision-making process of this type of model. The comparison of results between the different validation sets and the proof-of-concept has highlighted the risk of using synthetic data to handle imbalance and the main limitation of the framework: its restrictive class system. We conclude that the presented approach can successfully assist in the mineral classification workflow when specific analyses are not available, saving time and allowing a transparent and straightforward assessment of model predictions. Furthermore, we propose a workflow for the interpretation of predictions using the model outputs as compound responses enabling an uncertainty reduction approach currently used by our team. The Python-based framework is packaged in a public repository and includes all the necessary resources for its reusability without the need for any installation.",

    "title": "Predicting the Hallucinogenic Potential of Molecules Using Artificial Intelligence.",
    "abstract": "The development of new drugs addressing serious mental health and other disorders should avoid the psychedelic experience. Analogs of psychedelic drugs can have clinical utility and are termed \"psychoplastogens\". These represent promising candidates for treating opioid use disorder to reduce drug dependence, with rarely reported serious adverse effects. This drug abuse cessation is linked to the induction of neuritogenesis and increased neuroplasticity, a hallmark of psychedelic molecules, such as lysergic acid diethylamine. Some, but not all psychoplastogens may act through the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 5HT whereas others may display very different polypharmacology making prediction of hallucinogenic potential challenging. In the process of developing tools to help design new psychoplastogens, we have used artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning classification models for predicting psychedelic effects using a published in vitro data set from PsychLight (support vector classification (SVC), area under the curve (AUC) 0.74) and in vivo human data derived from books from Shulgin and Shulgin (SVC, AUC, 0.72) with nested five-fold cross validation. We have also explored conformal predictors with ECFP6 and electrostatic descriptors in an effort to optimize them. These models have been used to predict known 5HT agonists to assess their potential to act as psychedelics and induce hallucinations for PsychLight (SVC, AUC 0.97) and Shulgin and Shulgin (random forest, AUC 0.71). We have tested these models with head twitch data from the mouse. This predictive capability is desirable to reliably design new psychoplastogens that lack in vivo hallucinogenic potential and help assess existing and future molecules for this potential. These efforts also provide useful insights into understanding the psychedelic structure activity relationship.",

    "abstract": "Rapid changes in consumer preferences for high-quality animal-based protein have driven the poultry industry to identify non-invasive, in-line processing technologies for rapid detection of muscle meat quality defects. At production plants, technologies like radio-frequency waves (RF waves) can identify and separate myopathy-conditioned meat, reducing misclassification errors due to human fatigue and inexperience. Previous studies have shown that advanced diagnostic tools combined with complex data analytics, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs), can classify chicken breast myopathies post-deboning. This study demonstrates RF wave use for myopathy detection at four processing stages. Using 107 (48-day old) broilers, RF wave data in amplitude and phase were collected from live birds, pre-chilled without giblets (WOGs), post-chilled WOGs, and freshly deboned fillets (3-3.5 h post-slaughter) and examined by hand-palpation for woody breast categories (1-normal; 2-moderate; 3-severe). Data preprocessing involved false discovery rate and predictor analysis to identify specific signature frequencies and develop classification models using supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. Variable clustering analysis identified seven to eight different frequencies at various processing stages. Preprocessed data with identified signature frequencies were used to develop classification models using BPNN and SVM. BPNN demonstrated superior classification accuracy compared to SVM, with accuracy ranges from 90.0% to 96.1% for live birds, 78.9% to 97.1% for pre-chilled WOGs, 82.1% to 95.9% for post-chilled WOGs, and 94.2% to 98.2% for deboned fillets. Integrating specific RF range devices or sensors with supervised ML algorithms like SVM and BPNN in poultry processing can effectively detect muscle myopathies at different processing steps during in-line processing.",

With the help of fluorescence microscopy and electron tomography, researchers have accumulated extensive geometric data of membrane shapes during endocytosis. These data contain rich information about the mechanical properties of membranes, which are hard to access experiments due to the small dimensions of the endocytic patch. In this study, we propose an approach that combines machine learning with the Helfrich theory of membranes to infer the mechanical properties of membranes during endocytosis from a dataset of membrane shapes extracted from electron tomography. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can output solutions that both match the experimental profile and satisfy the membrane shape equations derived from Helfrich theory. The learning results show that during the early stage of endocytosis, the inferred membrane tension is negative, indicating the presence of strong compressive forces at the boundary of the endocytic invagination. Our method presents a generic framework for extracting membrane information from super-resolution imaging.",

Elastic net logistic regression was trained, using CAARMS items at baseline to predict individual evolution between converters (UHR-P) and non-converters (UHR-NP). Elastic-net was used to select the few CAARMS items that best predict the clinical evolution. All validations and significances of predictive models were computed with non-parametric re-sampling strategies that provide robust estimators even when the distributional assumption cannot be guaranteed. Among the 25 CAARMS items, the Elastic net selected 'obsessive-compulsive symptoms' and 'aggression/dangerous behavior' as risk factors for conversion while 'anhedonia' and 'mood swings/lability' were associated with non-conversion at follow-up. In the ten-fold stratified cross-validation, the classification achieved 81.8% of sensitivity (P = 0.035) and 93.7% of specificity (P = 0.0016). Non-psychotic prodromal symptoms bring valuable information to improve the prediction of conversion to psychosis.

Due to the vast design space available to modern synthetic chemistry, the community has increasingly sought to use data-driven and machine learning approaches to navigate this space. Although generative machine learning methods have recently shown potential for computational molecular design, their use is hindered by complex training procedures, and they often fail to generate valid and unique molecules. In this context, pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for molecular design, as they appear to be capable of creating and modifying molecules based on simple instructions provided through natural language prompts. In this work, we show that the Claude 3 Opus LLM can read, write, and modify molecules according to prompts, with impressive 97% valid and unique molecules. By quantifying these modifications in a low-dimensional latent space, we systematically evaluate the model's behavior under different prompting conditions. Notably, the model is able to perform guided molecular generation when asked to manipulate the electronic structure of molecules using simple, natural-language prompts.

However, the diagnosis of this condition is mainly based on physician's experiences and advanced diagnostic equipment. This study built and validated machine learning models to facilitate the detection of complicated appendicitis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on medical charts of all patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy at a city hospital during 2016-2020. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to adjust for the imbalance. Multiple classification approaches were used to train and validate models including support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient boosting (GB). Among 1,950 patients included in the data analysis, there were 483 patients identified as having complicated appendicitis (24.8%). Based on data without SMOTE adjustment for imbalance, the accuracy levels and AUCs were high in all models using different parameters, ranging from 0.687 to 0.815. After adjusting for imbalance data using SMOTE, AUC and accuracy levels in the models using imbalance adjusted data were higher. Of these, the GB had all AUC and accuracy values of approximately 0.8 or more in both adjusted and unadjusted data. Machine learning approaches including SVM, DT, logistic, KNN, ANN, and GB have a high level of validity in classifying patients with complicated appendicitis and patients without complicated appendicitis. Among these, GB had the highest level of validity and should be used or further validated. Our study indicates the beneficial potentials of machine learning techniques in a clinical setting in general and in the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis in particular.",

To inform the ongoing debate, we conduct an empirical study to characterize the impact of penalizing group fairness violations on an array of measures of model performance and group fairness. We repeat the analysis across multiple observational healthcare databases, clinical outcomes, and sensitive attributes. We find that procedures that penalize differences between the distributions of predictions across groups induce nearly-universal degradation of multiple performance metrics within groups. On examining the secondary impact of these procedures, we observe heterogeneity of the effect of these procedures on measures of fairness in calibration and ranking across experimental conditions. Beyond the reported trade-offs, we emphasize that analyses of algorithmic fairness in healthcare lack the contextual grounding and causal awareness necessary to reason about the mechanisms that lead to health disparities, as well as about the potential of algorithmic fairness methods to counteract those mechanisms. In light of these limitations, we encourage researchers building predictive models for clinical use to step outside the algorithmic fairness frame and engage critically with the broader sociotechnical context surrounding the use of machine learning in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "At present, inspection systems process visual data captured by cameras, with deep learning approaches applied to detect defects. Defect detection results usually have an accuracy higher than 94%. Real-life applications, however, are not very common. In this paper, we describe the development of a tire inspection system for the tire industry. We provide methods for processing tire sidewall data obtained from a camera and a laser sensor. The captured data comprise visual and geometric data characterizing the tire surface, providing a real representation of the captured tire sidewall. We use an unfolding process, that is, a polar transform, to further process the camera-obtained data. The principles and automation of the designed polar transform, based on polynomial regression (i.e., supervised learning), are presented. Based on the data from the laser sensor, the detection of abnormalities is performed using an unsupervised clustering method, followed by the classification of defects using the VGG-16 neural network. The inspection system aims to detect trained and untrained abnormalities, namely defects, as opposed to using only supervised learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advances have accelerated the use of Machine Learning in trauma science. This review provides an overview on the available evidence for research and patient care. The review aims to familiarize clinicians with this rapidly evolving field, offer perspectives, and identify existing and future challenges. The available evidence predominantly focuses on retrospective algorithm construction to predict outcomes. Few studies have explored actionable outcomes, workflow integration, or the impact on patient care. Machine Learning and data science have the potential to simplify data capture and enhance counterfactual causal inference research from observational data to address complex issues. However, regulatory, legal, and ethical challenges associated with the use of Machine Learning in trauma care deserve particular attention. Machine Learning holds promise for actionable decision support in trauma science, but rigorous proof-of-concept studies are urgently needed. Future research should assess workflow integration, human-machine interaction, and, most importantly, the impact on patient outcome. Machine Learning enhanced causal inference for observational data carries an enormous potential to change trauma research as complement to randomized studies. The scientific trauma community needs to engage with the existing challenges to drive progress in the field.",

    "abstract": "The present study employs density functional theory-based first principle calculation to investigate the electron transport properties of polyaniline following exposure to acidic and alkaline pH. In-situ deposited polyaniline-based paper device maintains emeraldine salt form while it is exposed to acidic pH and converts to emeraldine base when it is subjected to alkaline pH solutions. These structural changes at acidic and alkaline pH are validated experimentally by Raman spectra. Furthermore, the Raman spectra computed from density functional theory are validated with the experimental spectra. The changes in the theoretical energy band gap of polyaniline obtained from first principle calculations were correlated with the changes in the experimental impedimetric response of the sensor after exposure to acidic and alkaline solutions. Finally, the impedimetric responses were used to predict urine pH through a machine learning based smart and interactive web application. Different machine learning based regression models were implemented to acquire the best possible outcome. Gradient Boosting Regressor with least square loss model was selected as it showed lowest mean square, mean absolute, and root mean square error than other models. The smart sensing platform successfully predicts the unknown pH of urine samples with an average accuracy of more than 98%. The locally deployed smart web app can be accessed within a local area network by the end-user, which holds promise towards effective detection of urinary pH.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven models based on deep learning have led to tremendous breakthroughs in classical computer vision tasks and have recently made their way into natural sciences. However, the absence of domain knowledge in their inherent design significantly hinders the understanding and acceptance of these models. Nevertheless, explainability is crucial to justify the use of deep learning tools in safety-relevant applications such as aircraft component design, service and inspection. In this work, we train convolutional neural networks for crack tip detection in fatigue crack growth experiments using full-field displacement data obtained by digital image correlation. For this, we introduce the novel architecture ParallelNets-a network which combines segmentation and regression of the crack tip coordinates-and compare it with a classical U-Net-based architecture. Aiming for explainability, we use the Grad-CAM interpretability method to visualize the neural attention of several models. Attention heatmaps show that ParallelNets is able to focus on physically relevant areas like the crack tip field, which explains its superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and stability.",

    "abstract": "Identifying effective therapeutic targets poses a challenge in drug discovery, especially for uncharacterized diseases without known therapeutic targets (e.g. rare diseases, intractable diseases). This study presents a novel machine learning approach using multimodal vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) for predicting therapeutic target molecules across diseases. To address the lack of known therapeutic target-disease associations, we incorporate the information on uncharacterized diseases without known targets or uncharacterized proteins without known indications (applicable diseases) in the semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. The method integrates disease-specific and protein perturbation profiles with genetic perturbations (e.g. gene knockdowns and gene overexpressions) at the transcriptome level. Cross-cell representation learning, facilitated by VQ-VAEs, was performed to extract informative features from protein perturbation profiles across diverse human cell types. Concurrently, cross-disease representation learning was performed, leveraging VQ-VAE, to extract informative features reflecting disease states from disease-specific profiles. The model's applicability to uncharacterized diseases or proteins is enhanced by considering the consistency between disease-specific and patient-specific signatures. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated across three practical scenarios for 79 diseases: target repositioning for target-disease pairs, new target prediction for uncharacterized diseases, and new indication prediction for uncharacterized proteins. This method is expected to be valuable for identifying therapeutic targets across various diseases. Code: github.com/YamanishiLab/SSL-VQ and Data: 10.5281/zenodo.14644837.",

    "title": "The Challenge of Data Annotation in Deep Learning-A Case Study on Whole Plant Corn Silage.",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in computer vision are primarily driven by the usage of deep learning, which is known to require large amounts of data, and creating datasets for this purpose is not a trivial task. Larger benchmark datasets often have detailed processes with multiple stages and users with different roles during annotation. However, this can be difficult to implement in smaller projects where resources can be limited. Therefore, in this work we present our processes for creating an image dataset for kernel fragmentation and stover overlengths in Whole Plant Corn Silage. This includes the guidelines for annotating object instances in respective classes and statistics of gathered annotations. Given the challenging image conditions, where objects are present in large amounts of occlusion and clutter, the datasets appear appropriate for training models. However, we experience annotator inconsistency, which can hamper evaluation. Based on this we argue the importance of having an evaluation form independent of the manual annotation where we evaluate our models with physically based sieving metrics. Additionally, instead of the traditional time-consuming manual annotation approach, we evaluate Semi-Supervised Learning as an alternative, showing competitive results while requiring fewer annotations. Specifically, given a relatively large supervised set of around 1400 images we can improve the Average Precision by a number of percentage points. Additionally, we show a significantly large improvement when using an extremely small set of just over 100 images, with over 3× in Average Precision and up to 20 percentage points when estimating the quality.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC) migration is crucial for mounting immune responses. Immature DCs (imDCs) reportedly sense infections, while mature DCs (mDCs) move quickly to lymph nodes to deliver antigens to T cells. However, their highly heterogeneous and complex innate motility remains elusive. Here, we used an unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach to analyze long-term, two-dimensional migration trajectories of Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)-derived bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). We discovered three migratory modes independent of the cell state: slow-diffusive (SD), slow-persistent (SP), and fast-persistent (FP). Remarkably, imDCs more frequently changed their modes, predominantly following a unicyclic SD→FP→SP→SD transition, whereas mDCs showed no transition directionality. We report that DC migration exhibits a history-dependent mode transition and maturation-dependent motility changes are emergent properties of the dynamic switching of the three migratory modes. Our ML-based investigation provides new insights into studying complex cellular migratory behavior.",

In this paper, a smart patch based on a ZnO/aluminum (∼5 μm/50 μm thick) flexible Lamb wave device has been proposed to detect, prevent, and eliminate condensation, which can be realized using both of its surfaces. The patch is operated using a machine-learning algorithm which consists of data preprocessing (feature selection and optimization) and model training by a random forest algorithm. It has been tested in six cases, and the results show good detection performance with average precision = 94.40% and average 1 score = 93.23%. The principle of accelerating evaporation is investigated to understand the elimination and prevention functions for surface condensation. Results show that both dielectric heating and acoustothermal effect have their contributions, whereas the former is found more dominant. Furthermore, the functional relationship between the evaporation rate and the input power is calibrated, showing a high linearity ( = 97.64%) with a slope of ∼3.6 × 10 1/(s·mW). With an input power of ∼0.6 W, the flexible device has been proven effective in the prevention of condensation.",

The EEG signal dataset is subjected to filtering by using Infinite Impulse Response Butterworth Band Pass Filter and Hilbert Huang Transform. After pre-processing, the filtered EEG signal is manipulated for sub-band separation and it is fissioned into five frequency bands such as Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta. This work employs features such as energy, entropy, and variance which are computed for each frequency band obtained from the decomposed EEG signals. The selected features are imported for the classification process by using machine learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Kernel Functions, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are computed and analyzed for each classifier and it is inferred that the Support Vector Machine based classification of sleep apnea produces promising results.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the relationship between cognitive function and functional outcome in schizophrenia is mediated by clinical symptoms, while functional outcome is assessed by the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale. To determine the outcome assessed by QLS and GAF, we established a bagging ensemble framework with a feature selection algorithm resulting from the analysis of factors such as 3 clinical symptom scales and 11 cognitive function scores of 302 patients with schizophrenia in the Taiwanese population. We compared our bagging ensemble framework with other state-of-the-art algorithms such as multilayer feedforward neural networks, support vector machine, linear regression, and random forests. The analysis revealed that the bagging ensemble model with feature selection performed best among predictive models in predicting the QLS functional outcome by using 20-item Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS20) and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17). Moreover, to predict the GAF outcome, the bagging ensemble model with feature selection performed best among predictive models by using SANS20 and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Positive (PANSS-Positive) subscale. The study indicates that there are synergistic effects between negative (SANS20) and depressive (HAMD17) symptoms as well as between negative and positive (PANSS-Positive) symptoms in influencing functional outcome of schizophrenia using the bagging ensemble framework with feature selection.",

A team of five clinicians examined the demographic, clinical, and radiological details of each patient at baseline and reached a consensus on the best first-line treatment for bAVMs. Their treatment choice was used to train an automated supervised ML (autoML) model to select treatments for bAVMs for the training dataset. The accuracy and AUC of the algorithm in selecting the treatment strategy were measured for the test dataset, and feature importance scores of the included variables were calculated. Among the 100,000 combinations of supervised ML algorithms and their hyperparameters attempted by autoML, gradient boosting classifier had the best predictive performance with an overall accuracy of 0.74 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. The treatment-specific accuracies were 0.96, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.82; and AUCs were 0.75, 0.95, 0.80, and 0.88 for medical management, surgery, endovascular embolization, and gamma-knife radiosurgery, respectively. Spetzler-Martin score, followed by eloquent AVM location and AVM size, were the three most important features in determining treatments. ML could reliably select the best first-line treatment strategy for bAVMs as per multidisciplinary expert consensus. This study can be replicated for larger population-based AVM registries, with the inclusion of outcome data, thus helping address the bias involved in the management of unruptured bAVMs.",

The embeddings are extracted via self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, and WavLM). After extracting the embeddings, we benchmarked them with several traditional classifiers, including a support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) to detect depression. In addition, we investigated the impact of different layer depths in the upstream networks of these SSL models. The experimental results revealed that the Wav2Vec2.0 and WavLM features generalize better than the HuBERT features. Notably, WavLM features improved accuracy by 13.1% in depression detection over the best baseline features (MFCCs). These findings will aid future research in the use of SSL models in this field.",

We trained a pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) model on a large public data compendium comprising multiple experiments, tissues, and biological conditions and then transferred the model to small datasets in an approach we call MultiPLIER. Models constructed from the public data compendium included features that aligned well to known biological factors and were more comprehensive than those constructed from individual datasets or conditions.

For serving this purpose a Modified Artificial Plant Optimization (MAPO) algorithm has been proposed which can be used as an optimal feature selector along with other machine learning algorithms to predict the heart rate using the fingertip video dataset which further predicts the presence or absence of Coronary Heart Disease in an individual at the moment. Initially, the video dataset has been pre-processed, noise is filtered and then MAPO is applied to predict the heart rate with a Pearson correlation and Standard Error Estimate of 0.9541 and 2.418 respectively. The predicted heart rate is used as a feature in other two datasets and MAPO is again applied to optimize the features of both datasets. Different machine learning algorithms are then applied to the optimized dataset to predict values for presence of current heart disease. The result shows that MAPO reduces the dimensionality to the most significant information with comparable accuracies for different machine learning models with maximum dimensionality reduction of 81.25%. MAPO has been compared with other optimizers and outperforms them with better accuracy.",

    "title": "Investigating the influence of streetscape environmental characteristics on pedestrian crashes at intersections using street view images and explainable machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Examining the relationship between streetscape features and road traffic accidents is pivotal for enhancing roadway safety. While previous studies have primarily focused on the influence of street design characteristics, sociodemographic features, and land use features on crash occurrence, the impact of streetscape features on pedestrian crashes has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, while machine learning models demonstrate high accuracy in prediction and are increasingly utilized in traffic safety research, understanding the prediction results poses challenges. To address these gaps, this study extracts streetscape environment characteristics from street view images (SVIs) using a combination of semantic segmentation and object detection deep learning networks. These characteristics are then incorporated into the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, along with a set of control variables, to model the occurrence of pedestrian crashes at intersections. Subsequently, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is integrated with XGBoost to establish an interpretable framework for exploring the association between pedestrian crash occurrence and the surrounding streetscape built environment. The results are interpreted from global, local, and regional perspectives. The findings indicate that, from a global perspective, traffic volume and commercial land use are significant contributors to pedestrian-vehicle collisions at intersections, while road, person, and vehicle elements extracted from SVIs are associated with higher risks of pedestrian crash onset. At a local level, the XGBoost-SHAP framework enables quantification of features' local contributions for individual intersections, revealing spatial heterogeneity in factors influencing pedestrian crashes. From a regional perspective, similar intersections can be grouped to define geographical regions, facilitating the formulation of spatially responsive strategies for distinct regions to reduce traffic accidents. This approach can potentially enhance the quality and accuracy of local policy making. These findings underscore the underlying relationship between streetscape-level environmental characteristics and vehicle-pedestrian crashes. The integration of SVIs and deep learning techniques offers a visually descriptive portrayal of the streetscape environment at locations where traffic crashes occur at eye level. The proposed framework not only achieves excellent prediction performance but also enhances understanding of traffic crash occurrences, offering guidance for optimizing traffic accident prevention and treatment programs.",

    "abstract": "Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious condition that can lead to blindness; however, it is highly treatable with timely and appropriate treatment. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of RRD is crucial. In this study, we applied deep learning, a machine-learning technology, to detect RRD using ultra-wide-field fundus images and investigated its performance. In total, 411 images (329 for training and 82 for grading) from 407 RRD patients and 420 images (336 for training and 84 for grading) from 238 non-RRD patients were used in this study. The deep learning model demonstrated a high sensitivity of 97.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 94.2-100%] and a high specificity of 96.5% (95% CI, 90.2-100%), and the area under the curve was 0.988 (95% CI, 0.981-0.995). This model can improve medical care in remote areas where eye clinics are not available by using ultra-wide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy for the accurate diagnosis of RRD. Early diagnosis of RRD can prevent blindness.",

To address the problem, when some atomic information is missing, three approaches for classifying SSE types using Cα atoms in protein chains were developed: (1) a mathematical approach, (2) a deep learning approach, and (3) an ensemble of five machine learning models.

We then evaluated the effect of the different cognitive activities on EEG signals and its accuracy in predicting respective cognitive load. The analysis was conducted using well-known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, RF, and KNN. An average accuracy of 82.75% was obtained through the proposed SVM model to identify the participant's cognitive workload level. The results obtained through this study indicated the efficacy of the EEG features in predicting the level of cognitive load irrespective of the activity.

This shift is not limited to human healthcare; it extends to veterinary medicine as well, where AI's predictive analytics and diagnostic abilities are improving standards of animal care. Consequently, healthcare systems stand to gain notable advantages, such as enhanced accessibility, treatment efficacy, and optimized resource allocation, owing to the seamless integration of AI. This article presents a comprehensive review of the manifold applications of AI within the domain of veterinary science, categorizing them into four domains: clinical practice, biomedical research, public health, and administration.

    "abstract": "The machine learning-based virtual screening of molecular databases is a commonly used approach to identify hits. However, many aspects associated with training predictive models can influence the final performance and, consequently, the number of hits found. Thus, we performed a systematic study of the simultaneous influence of the proportion of negatives to positives in the testing set, the size of screening databases and the type of molecular representations on the effectiveness of classification. The results obtained for eight protein targets, five machine learning algorithms (SMO, Naïve Bayes, Ibk, J48 and Random Forest), two types of molecular fingerprints (MACCS and CDK FP) and eight screening databases with different numbers of molecules confirmed our previous findings that increases in the ratio of negative to positive training instances greatly influenced most of the investigated parameters of the ML methods in simulated virtual screening experiments. However, the performance of screening was shown to also be highly dependent on the molecular library dimension. Generally, with the increasing size of the screened database, the optimal training ratio also increased, and this ratio can be rationalized using the proposed cost-effectiveness threshold approach. To increase the performance of machine learning-based virtual screening, the training set should be constructed in a way that considers the size of the screening database.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) based on Wi-Fi signals has attracted significant attention due to its convenience and the availability of infrastructures and sensors. Channel State Information (CSI) measures how Wi-Fi signals propagate through the environment. However, many scenarios and applications have insufficient training data due to constraints such as cost, time, or resources. This poses a challenge for achieving high accuracy levels with machine learning techniques. In this study, multiple deep learning models for HAR were employed to achieve acceptable accuracy levels with much less training data than other methods. A pretrained encoder trained from a Multi-Input Multi-Output Autoencoder (MIMO AE) on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from a small subset of data samples was used for feature extraction. Then, fine-tuning was applied by adding the encoder as a fixed layer in the classifier, which was trained on a small fraction of the remaining data. The evaluation results (K-fold cross-validation and K = 5) showed that using only 30% of the training and validation data (equivalent to 24% of the total data), the accuracy was improved by 17.7% compared to the case where the encoder was not used (with an accuracy of 79.3% for the designed classifier, and an accuracy of 90.3% for the classifier with the fixed encoder). While by considering more calculational cost, achieving higher accuracy using the pretrained encoder as a trainable layer is possible (up to 2.4% improvement), this small gap demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for HAR using Wi-Fi signals.",

    "abstract": "The early detection of traumatic brain injuries can directly impact the prognosis and survival of patients. Preceding attempts to automate the detection and the assessment of the severity of traumatic brain injury continue to be based on clinical diagnostic methods, with limited tools for disease outcomes in large populations. Despite advances in machine and deep learning tools, current approaches still use simple trends of statistical analysis which lack generality. The effectiveness of deep learning to extract information from large subsets of data can be further emphasised through the use of more elaborate architectures. We therefore explore the use of a multiple input, convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (LSTM) integrated architecture in the context of traumatic injury detection through predicting the presence of brain injury in a murine preclinical model dataset. We investigated the effectiveness and validity of traumatic brain injury detection in the proposed model against various other machine learning algorithms such as the support vector machine, the random forest classifier and the feedforward neural network. Our dataset was acquired using a home cage automated (HCA) system to assess the individual behaviour of mice with traumatic brain injury or non-central nervous system (non-CNS) injured controls, whilst housed in their cages. Their distance travelled, body temperature, separation from other mice and movement were recorded every 15 minutes, for 72 hours weekly, for 5 weeks following intervention. The HCA behavioural data was used to train a deep learning model, which then predicts if the animals were subjected to a brain injury or just a sham intervention without brain damage. We also explored and evaluated different ways to handle the class imbalance present in the uninjured class of our training data. We then evaluated our models with leave-one-out cross validation. Our proposed deep learning model achieved the best performance and showed promise in its capability to detect the presence of brain trauma in mice.",

Here, we show how one can use one ML potential model to train another: we use an accurate, but more computationally expensive model to generate reference data (locations and labels) for a series of much faster potentials. Without the need for quantum-mechanical reference computations at the secondary stage, extensive reference datasets can be easily generated, and we find that this improves the quality of fast potentials with less flexible functional forms. We apply the technique to disordered silicon, including a simulation of vitrification and polycrystalline grain formation under pressure with a system size of a million atoms. Our work provides conceptual insight into the ML of interatomic potential models and suggests a route toward accelerated simulations of condensed-phase systems.",

The considered problem covers the matrix ℓ2,1-norm regularized least squares which is widely used in multi-task learning for capturing the joint feature among each task. To solve the problem, we firstly minimize a quadratic approximated model of the objective function to derive a search direction at current iteration. We show that this direction descends automatically and reduces to the original spectral gradient direction if the regularized term is removed. Secondly, we incorporate a nonmonotone line search along this direction to improve the algorithm's numerical performance. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to a critical point under some mild conditions. The attractive feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is easily performable and only requires the gradient of the smooth function and the objective function's values at each and every step. Finally, we operate some experiments on synthetic data, which verifies that the proposed algorithm works quite well and performs better than the compared ones.",

Working with macromolecular structure in a machine learning context requires an adequate numerical representation, and researchers have extensively studied representations such as graphs, discretized 3D grids, and distance maps. As part of CASP14, we explored a new and conceptually simple representation in a blind experiment: atoms as points in 3D, each with associated features. These features-initially just the basic element type of each atom-are updated through a series of neural network layers featuring rotation-equivariant convolutions. Starting from all atoms, we further aggregate information at the level of alpha carbons before making a prediction at the level of the entire protein structure. We find that this approach yields competitive results in protein model quality assessment despite its simplicity and despite the fact that it incorporates minimal prior information and is trained on relatively little data. Its performance and generality are particularly noteworthy in an era where highly complex, customized machine learning methods such as AlphaFold 2 have come to dominate protein structure prediction.",

    "title": "Development of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Technique of Rotary Machine Element Bearing: A Machine Learning Approach.",
    "abstract": "The bearing is an essential component of a rotating machine. Sudden failure of the bearing may cause an unwanted breakdown of the manufacturing plant. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis technique was developed to diagnose various faults that occur in a deep groove ball bearing. An experimental setup was designed and developed to generate faulty data in various conditions, such as inner race fault, outer race fault, and cage fault, along with the healthy condition. The time waveform of raw vibration data generated from the system was transformed into a frequency spectrum using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. These FFT signals were analyzed to detect the defective bearing. Another significant contribution of this paper is the application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm to diagnose bearing faults. The support vector machine (SVM) was used as the primary algorithm. As the efficiency of SVM heavily depends on hyperparameter tuning and optimum feature selection, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique was used to improve the model performance. The classification accuracy obtained using SVM with a traditional grid search cross-validation (CV) optimizer was 92%, whereas the improved accuracy using the PSO-based SVM was found to be 93.9%. The developed model was also compared with other traditional ML techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In every case, the proposed model outperformed the existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of MCI can allow for treatment to improve cognitive function and reduce modifiable risk factors. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of individual MCI detection from healthy control (HC) using a minimum duration of resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. In this study, nine different measurement durations (i.e., 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, and 270 s) were evaluated for MCI detection via the graph theory analysis and traditional machine learning approach, such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. Moreover, feature representation- and classification-based transfer learning (TL) methods were applied to identify MCI from HC through the input of connectivity maps with 30 and 90 s duration. There was no significant difference among the nine various time windows in the machine learning and graph theory analysis. The feature representation-based TL showed improved accuracy in both 30 and 90 s cases (i.e., 30 s: 81.27% and 90 s: 76.73%). Notably, the classification-based TL method achieved the highest accuracy of 95.81% using the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model with the 30 s interval functional connectivity map input. The results indicate that a 30 s measurement of the resting-state with fNIRS could be used to detect MCI. Moreover, the combination of neuroimaging (e.g., functional connectivity maps) and deep learning methods (e.g., CNN and TL) can be considered as novel biomarkers for clinical computer-assisted MCI diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The rise of network pharmacology has led to the widespread use of network-based computational methods in predicting drug target interaction (DTI). However, existing DTI prediction models typically rely on a limited amount of data to extract drug and target features, potentially affecting the comprehensiveness and robustness of features. In addition, although multiple networks are used for DTI prediction, the integration of heterogeneous information often involves simplistic aggregation and attention mechanisms, which may impose certain limitations. MSH-DTI, a deep learning model for predicting drug-target interactions, is proposed in this paper. The model uses self-supervised learning methods to obtain drug and target structure features. A Heterogeneous Interaction-enhanced Feature Fusion Module is designed for multi-graph construction, and the graph convolutional networks are used to extract node features. With the help of an attention mechanism, the model focuses on the important parts of different features for prediction. Experimental results show that the AUROC and AUPR of MSH-DTI are 0.9620 and 0.9605 respectively, outperforming other models on the DTINet dataset. The proposed MSH-DTI is a helpful tool to discover drug-target interactions, which is also validated through case studies in predicting new DTIs.",

    "abstract": "The completion design of multistage hydraulic fractured wells including the cluster spacing injected proppant and slurry volumes has shown a great influence on the well production rates and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). EUR estimation is a critical process to evaluate the well profitability. This study proposes the use of different machine learning techniques to predict the EUR as a function of the completion design including the lateral length, the number of stages, the total injected proppant and slurry volumes, and the maximum treating pressure measured during the fracturing operations. A data set of 200 well production data and completion designs was collected from oil production wells in the Niobrara shale formation. Artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) techniques were implemented to predict EUR from the completion design. The results showed a low accuracy of direct prediction of the EUR from the completion design. Hence, an intermediate step of estimating the initial well production rate ( ) from the completion data was carried out, and then, the and the completion design were used as input parameters to predict the EUR. The ANN and RF models accurately predicted the EUR from the completion design data and the estimated . The correlation coefficient ( ) values between actual EUR and predicted EUR from the ANN model were 0.96 and 0.95 compared with 0.99 and 0.95 from the RF model for training and testing, respectively. A new correlation was developed based on the weight and biases from the optimized ANN model with an value of 0.95. This study provides ML application with an empirical correlation to predict the EUR from the completion design parameters at an early time without the need for complex numerical simulation analysis.

The proposed solution has been designed to be suitable for implementation in industrial plants not directly designed for Industry 4.0 applications. More precisely, this manuscript delineates an approach for implementing three machine-learning algorithms into a digital twin environment and then applying them to a real plant. This paper is based on two previous studies in which the digital twin environment was first developed for the industrial plant under investigation, and then used for monitoring selected plant parameters. Findings from the previous studies are exploited in this work and advanced by implementing and testing the machine-learning algorithms. The results show that two out of the three machine-learning algorithms are effective enough in predicting anomalies, thus suggesting their implementation for enhancing the safety of employees working at industrial plants.",

For image analysis, custom tools were developed within labs and until relatively recently, software packages were not widely available between researchers. We will discuss some of the most popular methods for calcium imaging analysis that are now widely available and describe why these protocols are so effective. We will also describe some of the newest innovations in the field that are likely to benefit researchers, particularly as calcium imaging is often an inherently low signal-to-noise method. Although calcium imaging analysis has seen recent advances, particularly following the rise of machine learning, we will end by highlighting the outstanding requirements and questions that hinder further progress and pose the question of how far we have come in the past sixty years and what can be expected for future development in the field.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) based drug design has demonstrated great potential to fundamentally change the pharmaceutical industries. Currently, a key issue in AI-based drug design is efficient transferable molecular descriptors or fingerprints. Here, we present hypergraph-based molecular topological representation, hypergraph-based (weighted) persistent cohomology (HPC/HWPC) and HPC/HWPC-based molecular fingerprints for machine learning models in drug design. Molecular structures and their atomic interactions are highly complicated and pose great challenges for efficient mathematical representations. We develop the first hypergraph-based topological framework to characterize detailed molecular structures and interactions at atomic level. Inspired by the elegant path complex model, hypergraph-based embedded homology and persistent homology have been proposed recently. Based on them, we construct HPC/HWPC, and use them to generate molecular descriptors for learning models in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, one of the key step in drug design. Our models are tested on three most commonly-used databases, including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013 and PDBbind-v2016, and outperform all existing machine learning models with traditional molecular descriptors. Our HPC/HWPC models have demonstrated great potential in AI-based drug design.",

It is not clear that when brain aging initiates, but elderly people are vulnerable to be incipient of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The EEG signals were recorded from 20 healthy middle age and 20 healthy elderly subjects while performing a working memory task. Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), Katz's fractal dimension (KFD), sample entropy and three Hjorth parameters were extracted to analyse the complexity of EEG signals. Four machine learning classifiers, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and logistic model tree (LMT) were employed to distinguish the EEG signals of middle age and elderly age groups. HFD, KFD and Hjorth complexity were found significantly correlated with age. MLP achieved the highest overall accuracy of 93.75%. For posterior region, the maximum accuracy of 92.50% was achieved using MLP. Since fractal dimension associated with the complexity of EEG signals, HFD, KFD and Hjorth complexity demonstrated the decreased complexity from middle age to elderly groups. The complexity features appear to be more appropriate indicators of monitoring EEG signal complexity in healthy aging.",

    "title": "A study on diversion behavior in weaving segments: Individualized traffic conflict prediction and causal mechanism analysis.",
    "abstract": "Lane change behavior disrupts traffic flow and increases the potential for traffic conflicts, especially on expressway weaving segments. Focusing on the diversion process, this study incorporating individual driving patterns into conflict prediction and causation analysis can help develop individualized intervention measures to avoid risky diversion behaviors. First, to minimize measurement errors, this study introduces a lane line reconstruction method. Second, several unsupervised clustering methods, including k-means, agglomerative clustering, gaussian mixture, and spectral clustering, are applied to explore diversion patterns. Moreover, machine learning methods, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Attention-based LSTM, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are employed for real-time traffic conflict prediction. Finally, mixed logit models are developed using pre-conflict condition data to investigate the causal mechanisms of traffic conflicts. The results indicate that the K-means algorithm with four clusters exhibits the highest Calinski-Harabasz and Silhouette scores and the lowest Davies-Bouldin scores. With superior classification accuracy and generalization ability, the LSTM is used to develop the personalized traffic conflict prediction model. Sensitivity analysis indicates that incorporating the diversion patterns into the LSTM model results in an improvement of 3.64% in Accuracy, 7.15% in Precision, and 1.34% in Recall. Results from the four mixed logit models indicate significant differences in factors contributing to traffic conflicts within each diversion pattern. For instance, increasing the speed difference between the target vehicle and the right preceding vehicle benefits traffic conflict during acceleration diversions but decreases the likelihood of traffic conflicts during deceleration diversions. These results can help traffic engineers propose individualized solutions to reduce unsafe diversion behavior.",

Hence, TTK inhibition is considered a promising therapeutic anti-cancer strategy. In this work, we used multiple docked poses of TTK inhibitors to augment training data for machine learning QSAR modeling. Ligand-Receptor Contacts Fingerprints and docking scoring values were used as descriptor variables. Escalating docking-scoring consensus levels were scanned against orthogonal machine learners, and the best learners (Random Forests and XGBoost) were coupled with genetic algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to determine critical descriptors for predicting anti-TTK bioactivity and for pharmacophore generation. Three successful pharmacophores were deduced and subsequently used for in silico screening against the NCI database. A total of 14 hits were evaluated in vitro for their anti-TTK bioactivities. One hit of novel chemotype showed reasonable dose-response curve with experimental IC of 1.0 μM. The presented work indicates the validity of data augmentation using multiple docked poses for building successful machine learning models and pharmacophore hypotheses.",

We assess the ability of the machine learning potentials, ANI-1ccx and ANI-2x, and the GFN2-xTB semiempirical quantum chemical method, to model ring pucker conformers of five monosaccharides and oxane in the gas phase. Relative to coupled-cluster quantum mechanical calculations, we find that ANI-1ccx most accurately reproduces the ring pucker energy landscape for these molecules, with a correlation coefficient r of 0.83. This correlation in relative energies lowers to values of 0.70 for ANI-2x and 0.60 for GFN2-xTB. The ANI-1ccx also provides the most accurate estimate of the energetics of the C -to- C minimum energy pathway for the six molecules. All three models reproduce chair more accurately than non-chair geometries. Analysis of small model molecules suggests that the ANI-1ccx model favors puckers with equatorial hydrogen bonding substituents; that ANI-2x and GFN2-xTB models overstabilize conformers with axially oriented groups; and that the endo-anomeric effect is overestimated by the machine learning models and underestimated via the GFN2-xTB method. While the pucker conformers considered in this study correspond to a gas phase environment, the accuracy and computational efficiency of the ANI-1ccx approach in modeling ring pucker in vacuo provides a promising basis for future evaluation and application to condensed phase environments.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of high-resolution inertial sensor and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data collected by mobile and wearable devices is a relatively new methodology in forestry and safety research that provides opportunities for modeling work activities in greater detail than traditional time study analysis. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether smartwatch-based activity recognition models could quantify the activities of rigging crew workers setting and disconnecting log chokers on cable logging operations. Four productive cycle elements (travel to log, set choker, travel away, clear) were timed for choker setters and four productive cycle elements (travel to log, unhook, travel away, clear) were timed for chasers working at five logging sites in North Idaho. Each worker wore a smartwatch that recorded accelerometer data at 25 Hz. Random forest machine learning was used to develop predictive models that classified the different cycle elements based on features extracted from the smartwatch acceleration data using 15 sliding window sizes (1 to 15 s) and five window overlap levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90%). Models were compared using multiclass area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC. The best choker setter model was created using a 3-s window with 90% overlap and had sensitivity values ranging from 76.95% to 83.59% and precision values ranging from 41.42% to 97.08%. The best chaser model was created using a 1-s window with 90% overlap and had sensitivity values ranging from 71.95% to 82.75% and precision values ranging from 14.74% to 99.16%.

Due to the limited power in wireless sensor networks, options to rely on the security of ordinary protocols embodied in encryption and key management are futile due to the nature of communication between sensors and the ever-changing network topology. Therefore, machine learning algorithms are one of the proposed solutions for providing security services in this type of network by including monitoring and decision intelligence. Machine learning algorithms present additional hurdles in terms of training and the amount of data required for training. This paper provides a convenient reference for wireless sensor network infrastructure and the security challenges it faces. It also discusses the possibility of benefiting from machine learning algorithms by reducing the security costs of wireless sensor networks in several domains; in addition to the challenges and proposed solutions to improving the ability of sensors to identify threats, attacks, risks, and malicious nodes through their ability to learn and self-development using machine learning algorithms.

This development is thanks to the increase in data availability as well as to advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning research and access to computational resources. Highly promising research examples are published daily. However, at the same time, there are some unrealistic, often overly optimistic, expectations and assumptions with regard to the development, validation and acceptance of such methods. The healthcare application field introduces requirements and potential pitfalls that are not immediately obvious from the 'general data science' viewpoint. Reliable, objective, and generalisable validation and performance assessment of developed data-analysis methods is one particular pain-point. This may lead to unmet schedules and disappointments regarding true performance in real-life with as result poor uptake (or non-uptake) at the end-user side. It is the aim of this tutorial to provide practical guidance on how to assess performance reliably and efficiently and avoid common traps especially when dealing with application for health and wellness settings. Instead of giving a list of do's and don't s, this tutorial tries to build a better understanding behind these issues and presents both the most relevant performance evaluation criteria as well as approaches how to compute them.

The technology is available today for such AVI applications. Machine vision companies have integrated ML as an additional visual inspection tool with minimal upgrades to existing hardware. Studies have demonstrated superior results in defect detection and reduction in false rejects, when compared with conventional inspection tools. ML implementation does not require modifications to current AVI qualification strategies. The utilization of this technology for AVI will accelerate recipe development by use of faster computers rather than by direct human configuration and coding of vision tools.

Here we characterized the environmental risk of 50 main kinds of antibiotics from 9 classes at a concentration of 10 μg/L for aquatic bacterial communities via metadata analysis combined with machine learning. Metadata analysis showed that the alpha diversity of the bacterial community increased only after treatment with aminoglycoside and β-lactam antibiotics, while its structure was changed by almost all tested antibiotics. The antibiotic treatment also disturbed the functions of the bacterial community, especially with regard to metabolic pathways, including amino acids, cofactors, vitamins, xenobiotics and carbohydrate metabolism. The critical characteristics (atom stereocenter count, number of hydrogen atoms in the antibiotic, and the adipose water coefficient) of antibiotics affecting the composition of the bacterial community in aquatic habitats were screened by machine learning. The key characteristics of antibiotics affecting the function bacterial communities were the number of hydrogen atoms, molecular weight and complexity. In summary, by developing machine learning models and by performing metadata analysis, this study provides the relationship between the properties of antibiotics and their adverse impacts on aquatic microbial communities from a macro perspective. The study also provides guidance for the rational design of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Gene/feature selection is an essential preprocessing step for creating models using machine learning techniques. It also plays a critical role in different biological applications such as the identification of biomarkers. Although many feature/gene selection algorithms and methods have been introduced, they may suffer from problems such as parameter tuning or low level of performance. To tackle such limitations, in this study, a universal wrapper approach is introduced based on our introduced optimization algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed approach, candidate solutions have variable lengths, and a support vector machine scores them. To show the usefulness of the method, thirteen classification and regression-based datasets with different properties were chosen from various biological scopes, including drug discovery, cancer diagnostics, clinical applications, etc. Our findings confirmed that the proposed method outperforms most of the other currently used approaches and can also free the users from difficulties related to the tuning of various parameters. As a result, users may optimize their biological applications such as obtaining a biomarker diagnostic kit with the minimum number of genes and maximum separability power.",

    "title": "Stabilizing machine learning prediction of dynamics: Novel noise-inspired regularization tested with reservoir computing.",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that machine learning (ML) models can skillfully forecast the dynamics of unknown chaotic systems. Short-term predictions of the state evolution and long-term predictions of the statistical patterns of the dynamics (\"climate\") can be produced by employing a feedback loop, whereby the model is trained to predict forward only one time step, then the model output is used as input for multiple time steps. In the absence of mitigating techniques, however, this feedback can result in artificially rapid error growth (\"instability\"). One established mitigating technique is to add noise to the ML model training input. Based on this technique, we formulate a new penalty term in the loss function for ML models with memory of past inputs that deterministically approximates the effect of many small, independent noise realizations added to the model input during training. We refer to this penalty and the resulting regularization as Linearized Multi-Noise Training (LMNT). We systematically examine the effect of LMNT, input noise, and other established regularization techniques in a case study using reservoir computing, a machine learning method using recurrent neural networks, to predict the spatiotemporal chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We find that reservoir computers trained with noise or with LMNT produce climate predictions that appear to be indefinitely stable and have a climate very similar to the true system, while the short-term forecasts are substantially more accurate than those trained with other regularization techniques. Finally, we show the deterministic aspect of our LMNT regularization facilitates fast reservoir computer regularization hyperparameter tuning.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly its use for predicting native protein structures from sequence information alone. However, biomolecules are inherently dynamic, and there is a pressing need for accurate predictions of dynamic structural ensembles across multiple functional levels. These problems range from the relatively well-defined task of predicting conformational dynamics around the native state of a protein, which traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are particularly adept at handling, to generating large-scale conformational transitions connecting distinct functional states of structured proteins or numerous marginally stable states within the dynamic ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. Machine learning has been increasingly applied to learn low-dimensional representations of protein conformational spaces, which can then be used to drive additional MD sampling or directly generate novel conformations. These methods promise to greatly reduce the computational cost of generating dynamic protein ensembles, compared to traditional MD simulations. In this review, we examine recent progress in machine learning approaches towards generative modeling of dynamic protein ensembles and emphasize the crucial importance of integrating advances in machine learning, structural data, and physical principles to achieve these ambitious goals.",

    "abstract": "Accurate sleep stage classification is significant for sleep health assessment. In recent years, several machine-learning based sleep staging algorithms have been developed, and in particular, deep-learning based algorithms have achieved performance on par with human annotation. Despite improved performance, a limitation of most deep-learning based algorithms is their black-box behavior, which have limited their use in clinical settings. Here, we propose a cross-modal transformer, which is a transformer-based method for sleep stage classification. The proposed cross-modal transformer consists of a cross-modal transformer encoder architecture along with a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network for automatic representation learning. The performance of our method is on-par with the state-of-the-art methods and eliminates the black-box behavior of deep-learning models by utilizing the interpretability aspect of the attention modules. Furthermore, our method provides considerable reductions in the number of parameters and training time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Ethiopia has been challenged by the growing magnitude of diabetes in general and type-2 diabetes in particular. Knowledge extraction from stored dataset can be an important base for better decision on diabetes rapid diagnosis, suggestive on prediction for early intervention. Thus, this study was addressed these problem by application of supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction of type 2 diabetes disease status and might provide context-specific information to program planners and policy makers so that, priority will be given to the more affected groups. To apply supervised machine learning algorithms; compare these algorithms and select the best algorithm based on their performance for classification and prediction of type-2 diabetic disease status (positive or negative) in public hospitals of Afar regional state, Northeastern Ethiopia. This study was conducted at Afar regional state from February to June of 2021. Decision tree; pruned J 48, Artificial neural network, K-nearest neighbor, Support vector machine, Binary logistic regression, Random forest, and Naïve Bayes supervised machine learning algorithms were applied using secondary data from the medical database record review. A total of 2239 sample Dataset diagnosed for diabetes from 2012 to April 22/2020 (1523 with type-2 diabetes and 716 without type-2 diabetes) was checked for its completeness prior to analysis. For all algorithms, WEKA3.7 tool was used for analysis purposes. Moreover, all algorithms were compared based on their correctly classification rate, kappa statistics, confusion matrix, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. From the seven major supervised machine learning algorithms, the best classification and prediction results were obtained from random forest [correctly classified rate (93.8%), kappa statistics (0.85), sensitivity (0.98), area under the curve (0.97) and confusion matrix (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 446)] which was followed by decision tree pruned J 48 [correctly classified rate (91.8%), kappa statistics (0.80), sensitivity (0.96), area under the curve (0.91) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 438)] and k-nearest neighbor [correctly classified rate (89.8%), kappa statistics (0.76), sensitivity (0.92), area under the curve (0.88) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 421)]. Random forest, Decision tree pruned J48 and k-nearest neighbor algorithms have better classification and prediction performance for classifying and predicting type-2 diabetes disease status. Therefore, based on this performance, random forest algorithm can be judged as suggestive and supportive for clinicians at the time of type-2 diabetes diagnosis.",

    "title": "A Privacy-Preserved Variational-Autoencoder for DGA Identification in the Education Industry and Distance Learning.",
    "abstract": "One of the most insidious methods of bypassing security mechanisms in a modern information system is the domain generation algorithms (DGAs), which are used to disguise the identity of malware by periodically switching the domain name assigned to a command and control (C&C) server. Combating advanced techniques, such as DGAs, is an ongoing challenge that security organizations often need to work with and possibly share private data to train better and more up-to-date machine learning models. This logic raises serious concerns about data integrity, trade-related issues, and strict privacy protocols that must be adhered to. To address the concerns regarding the privacy and security of private data, we propose in this work a privacy-preserved variational-autoencoder to DGA combined with case studies from the education industry and distance learning, specifically because the recent pandemic has brought an explosive increase to remote learning. This is a system that, using the secured multi-party computation (SMPC) methodology, can successfully apply machine learning techniques, specifically the Siamese variational-autoencoder algorithm, on encrypted data and metadata. The method proposed for the first time in the literature facilitates learning specialized extraction functions of useful intermediate representations in complex deep learning architectures, producing improved training stability, high generalization performance, and remarkable categorization accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The adaptability of heart to external and internal stimuli is reflected by the heart rate variability (HRV). Reduced HRV can be a predictor of negative cardiovascular outcomes. Based on the nonlinear, nonstationary, and highly complex dynamics of the controlling mechanism of the cardiovascular system, linear HRV measures have limited capability to accurately analyze the underlying dynamics. In this study, we propose an automated system to analyze HRV signals by extracting multimodal features to capture temporal, spectral, and complex dynamics. Robust machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) with its kernel (linear, Gaussian, radial base function, and polynomial), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and ensemble classifiers, were employed to evaluate the detection performance. Performance was evaluated in terms of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The highest performance was obtained using SVM linear kernel (TA = 93.1%, AUC = 0.97, 95% CI [lower bound = 0.04, upper bound = 0.89]), followed by ensemble subspace discriminant (TA = 91.4%, AUC = 0.96, 95% CI [lower bound 0.07, upper bound = 0.81]) and SVM medium Gaussian kernel (TA = 90.5%, AUC = 0.95, 95% CI [lower bound = 0.07, upper bound = 0.86]). The results reveal that the proposed approach can provide an effective and computationally efficient tool for automatic detection of congestive heart failure patients.",

A narrative review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities.",

    "title": "Testing machine learning techniques for general application by using protein secondary structure prediction. A brief survey with studies of pitfalls and benefits using a simple progressive learning approach.",
    "abstract": "Many researchers have recently used the prediction of protein secondary structure (local conformational states of amino acid residues) to test advances in predictive and machine learning technology such as Neural Net Deep Learning. Protein secondary structure prediction continues to be a helpful tool in research in biomedicine and the life sciences, but it is also extremely enticing for testing predictive methods such as neural nets that are intended for different or more general purposes. A complication is highlighted here for researchers testing their methods for other applications. Modern protein databases inevitably contain important clues to the answer, so-called \"strong buried clues\", though often obscurely; they are hard to avoid. This is because most proteins or parts of proteins in a modern protein data base are related to others by biological evolution. For researchers developing machine learning and predictive methods, this can overstate and so confuse understanding of the true quality of a predictive method. However, for researchers using the algorithms as tools, understanding strong buried clues is of great value, because they need to make maximum use of all information available. A simple method related to the GOR methods but with some features of neural nets in the sense of progressive learning of large numbers of weights, is used to explore this. It can acquire tens of millions and hence gigabytes of weights, but they are learned stably by exhaustive sampling. The significance of the findings is discussed in the light of promising recent results from AlphaFold using Google's DeepMind.",

    "abstract": "Road crash fatality is a universal problem of the transportation system. A massive death toll caused annually due to road crash incidents, and among them, vulnerable road users (VRU) are endangered with high crash severity. This paper focuses on employing machine learning-based classification approaches for modelling injury severity of vulnerable road users-pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorcyclist. Specifically, this study aims to analyse critical features associated with different VRU groups-for pedestrian, bicyclist, motorcyclist and all VRU groups together. The critical factor of crash severity outcomes for these VRU groups is estimated in identifying the similarities and differences across different important features associated with different VRU groups. The crash data for the study is sourced from the state of Queensland in Australia for the years 2013 through 2019. The supervised machine learning algorithms considered for the empirical analysis includes the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). In these models, 17 distinct road crash parameters are considered as input features to train models, which originate from road user characteristics, weather and environment, vehicle and driver condition, period, road characteristics and regions, traffic, and speed jurisdiction. These classification models are separately trained and tested for individual and unified VRU to assess crash severity levels. Afterwards, model performances are compared with each other to justify the best classifier where Random Forest classification models for all VRU modes are found to be comparatively robust in test accuracy: (motorcyclist: 72.30%, bicyclist: 64.45%, pedestrian: 67.23%, unified VRU: 68.57%). Based on the Random Forest model, the road crash features are ranked and compared according to their impact on crash severity classification. Furthermore, a model-based partial dependency of each road crash parameters on the severity levels is plotted and compared for each individual and unified VRU. This clarifies the tendency of road crash parameters to vary with different VRU crash severity. Based on the outcome of the comparative analysis, motorcyclists are found to be more likely exposed to higher crash severity, followed by pedestrians and bicyclists.",

Researchers are searching for alternative strategies to identify the author of an unknown text. There is a need to develop a system to identify the actual author of unknown texts based on a given set of writing samples. This study presents a novel approach based on ensemble learning, DistilBERT, and conventional machine learning techniques for authorship identification. The proposed approach extracts the valuable characteristics of the author using a count vectorizer and bi-gram Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). An extensive and detailed dataset, \"All the news\" is used in this study for experimentation. The dataset is divided into three subsets (article1, article2, and article3). We limit the scope of the dataset and selected ten authors in the first scope and 20 authors in the second scope for experimentation. The experimental results of proposed ensemble learning and DistilBERT provide better performance for all the three subsets of the \"All the news\" dataset. In the first scope, the experimental results prove that the proposed ensemble learning approach from 10 authors provides a better accuracy gain of 3.14% and from DistilBERT 2.44% from the article1 dataset. Similarly, in the second scope from 20 authors, the proposed ensemble learning approach provides a better accuracy gain of 5.25% and from DistilBERT 7.17% from the article1 dataset, which is better than previous state-of-the-art studies.",

    "abstract": "An important problem that hinders the use of supervised classification algorithms for brain imaging is that the number of variables per single subject far exceeds the number of training subjects available. Deriving multivariate measures of variable importance becomes a challenge in such scenarios. This paper proposes a new measure of variable importance termed sign-consistency bagging (SCB). The SCB captures variable importance by analyzing the sign consistency of the corresponding weights in an ensemble of linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Further, the SCB variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. This extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. Finally, the proposal of these SCB variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance. The new importance measures were compared with a t-test based univariate and an SVM-based multivariate variable importances using anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The obtained results demonstrated that the new SCB based importance measures were superior to the compared methods in terms of reproducibility and classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Digital technologies hold enormous potential for improving the performance of future-generation sorting and processing plants; however, this potential remains largely untapped. Improved sensor-based material flow characterization (SBMC) methods could enable new sensor applications such as adaptive plant control, improved sensor-based sorting (SBS), and more far-reaching data utilizations along the value chain. This review aims to expedite research on SBMC by (i) providing a comprehensive overview of existing SBMC publications, (ii) summarizing existing SBMC methods, and (iii) identifying future research potentials in SBMC. By conducting a systematic literature search covering the period 2000 - 2021, we identified 198 peer-reviewed journal articles on SBMC applications based on optical sensors and machine learning algorithms for dry-mechanical recycling of non-hazardous waste. The review shows that SBMC has received increasing attention in recent years, with more than half of the reviewed publications published between 2019 and 2021. While applications were initially focused solely on SBS, the last decade has seen a trend toward new applications, including sensor-based material flow monitoring, quality control, and process monitoring/control. However, SBMC at the material flow and process level remains largely unexplored, and significant potential exists in upscaling investigations from laboratory to plant scale. Future research will benefit from a broader application of deep learning methods, increased use of low-cost sensors and new sensor technologies, and the use of data streams from existing SBS equipment. These advancements could significantly improve the performance of future-generation sorting and processing plants, keep more materials in closed loops, and help paving the way towards circular economy.",

    "title": "A Wrapper Feature Subset Selection Method Based on Randomized Search and Multilayer Structure.",
    "abstract": "The identification of discriminative features from information-rich data with the goal of clinical diagnosis is crucial in the field of biomedical science. In this context, many machine-learning techniques have been widely applied and achieved remarkable results. However, disease, especially cancer, is often caused by a group of features with complex interactions. Unlike traditional feature selection methods, which only focused on finding single discriminative features, a multilayer feature subset selection method (MLFSSM), which employs randomized search and multilayer structure to select a discriminative subset, is proposed herein. In each level of this method, many feature subsets are generated to assure the diversity of the combinations, and the weights of features are evaluated on the performances of the subsets. The weight of a feature would increase if the feature is selected into more subsets with better performances compared with other features on the current layer. In this manner, the values of feature weights are revised layer-by-layer; the precision of feature weights is constantly improved; and better subsets are repeatedly constructed by the features with higher weights. Finally, the topmost feature subset of the last layer is returned. The experimental results based on five public gene datasets showed that the subsets selected by MLFSSM were more discriminative than the results by traditional feature methods including LVW (a feature subset method used the Las Vegas method for randomized search strategy), GAANN (a feature subset selection method based genetic algorithm (GA)), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Furthermore, MLFSSM showed higher classification performance than some state-of-the-art methods which selected feature pairs or groups, including top scoring pair (TSP), k-top scoring pairs (K-TSP), and relative simplicity-based direct classifier (RS-DC).",

    "abstract": "We use energies and forces predicted within response operator based quantum machine learning (OQML) to perform geometry optimization and transition state search calculations with legacy optimizers but without the need for subsequent re-optimization with quantum chemistry methods. For randomly sampled initial coordinates of small organic query molecules, we report systematic improvement of equilibrium and transition state geometry output as training set sizes increase. Out-of-sample S 2 reactant complexes and transition state geometries have been predicted using the LBFGS and the QST2 algorithms with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.16 and 0.4 Å-after training on up to 200 reactant complex relaxations and transition state search trajectories from the QMrxn20 dataset, respectively. For geometry optimizations, we have also considered relaxation paths up to 5'595 constitutional isomers with sum formula C H O from the QM9-database. Using the resulting OQML models with an LBFGS optimizer reproduces the minimum geometry with an RMSD of 0.14 Å, only using ∼6000 training points obtained from normal mode sampling along the optimization paths of the training compounds without the need for active learning. For converged equilibrium and transition state geometries, subsequent vibrational normal mode frequency analysis indicates deviation from MP2 reference results by on average 14 and 26 cm , respectively. While the numerical cost for OQML predictions is negligible in comparison to density functional theory or MP2, the number of steps until convergence is typically larger in either case. The success rate for reaching convergence, however, improves systematically with training set size, underscoring OQML's potential for universal applicability.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the qualitative moral impact of machine learning-based clinical decision support systems in the process of medical diagnosis. To date, discussions about machine learning in this context have focused on problems that can be measured and assessed quantitatively, such as by estimating the extent of potential harm or calculating incurred risks. We maintain that such discussions neglect the qualitative moral impact of these technologies. Drawing on the philosophical approaches of technomoral change and technological mediation theory, which explore the interplay between technologies and morality, we present an analysis of concerns related to the adoption of machine learning-aided medical diagnosis. We analyze anticipated moral issues that machine learning systems pose for different stakeholders, such as bias and opacity in the way that models are trained to produce diagnoses, changes to how health care providers, patients, and developers understand their roles and professions, and challenges to existing forms of medical legislation. Albeit preliminary in nature, the insights offered by the technomoral change and the technological mediation approaches expand and enrich the current discussion about machine learning in diagnostic practices, bringing distinct and currently underexplored areas of concern to the forefront. These insights can contribute to a more encompassing and better informed decision-making process when adapting machine learning techniques to medical diagnosis, while acknowledging the interests of multiple stakeholders and the active role that technologies play in generating, perpetuating, and modifying ethical concerns in health care.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent multifactorial disorder that can increase the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. We aimed to compare different machine learning classification methods in predicting metabolic syndrome status as well as identifying influential genetic or environmental risk factors. This candidate gene study was conducted on 4756 eligible participants from the Tehran Cardio-metabolic Genetic study (TCGS). We compared predictive models using logistic regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and discriminant analyses. Demographic and clinical features, as well as variables regarding common GCKR gene polymorphisms, were included in the models. We used a 10-repeated tenfold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. 50.6% of participants had MetS. MetS was significantly associated with age, gender, schooling years, BMI, physical activity, rs780094, and rs780093 (P < 0.05) as indicated by LR. RF showed the best performance overall (AUC-ROC = 0.804, AUC-PR = 0.776, and Accuracy = 0.743) and indicated BMI, physical activity, and age to be the most influential model features. According to the DT, a person with BMI < 24 and physical activity < 8.8 possesses a 4% chance for MetS. In contrast, a person with BMI ≥ 25, physical activity < 2.7, and age ≥ 33, has 77% probability of suffering from MetS. Our findings indicated that, on average, machine learning models outperformed conventional statistical approaches for patient classification. These well-performing models may be used to develop future support systems that use a variety of data sources to identify persons at high risk of getting MetS.",

    "abstract": "Determining which substances on the global market could be classified as persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substances or very persistent, very mobile (vPvM) substances is essential to prevent or reduce drinking water contamination from them. This study developed machine learning models based on different molecular descriptors (MDs) and defined applicability domains for the screening of PMT/vPvM substances. The models were trained with 3111 substances with expert weight-of-evidence based PMT/vPvM hazard classifications that considered the highest quality data available. The model was based on the hypothesis that PMT/vPvM substances contain similar MDs, representative of chemical structures resistant to degradation, be associated with low sorption (or high-water solubility) and in some cases be associated with known toxic mechanisms. All possible model combinations were tested by integrating different molecular description methods, data balancing strategies and machine learning algorithms. Our model allows one-step prediction of candidate PMT/vPvM substances, and our method was compared with the approach predicting P, M and T separately (i.e. three-step prediction). The results showed that the one-step model achieved a higher accuracy of 92% for PMT/vPvM identification (i.e. positive samples) for an internal test set, and also resulted in a higher accuracy of 90% for an external test set of chemical pollutants detected in Taihu Lake, China. Furthermore, prediction mechanism of the model was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). This work presents an advance of big data in silico screening models for the identification of substances that potentially meet the PMT/vPvM criteria.",

    "abstract": "Functional seizures (FS) look like epileptic seizures but are characterized by a lack of epileptic activity in the brain. Approximately one in five referrals to epilepsy clinics are diagnosed with this condition. FS are diagnosed by recording a seizure using video-electroencephalography (EEG), from which an expert inspects the semiology and the EEG. However, this method can be expensive and inaccessible and can present significant patient burden. No single biomarker has been found to diagnose FS. However, the current limitations in FS diagnosis could be improved with machine learning to classify signal features extracted from EEG, thus providing a potentially very useful aid to clinicians. The current study has investigated the use of seizure-free EEG signals with machine learning to identify subjects with FS from those with epilepsy. The dataset included interictal and preictal EEG recordings from 48 subjects with FS (mean age = 34.76 ± 10.55 years, 14 males) and 29 subjects with epilepsy (mean age = 38.95 ± 13.93 years, 18 males) from which various statistical, temporal, and spectral features from the five EEG frequency bands were extracted then analyzed with threshold accuracy, five machine learning classifiers, and two feature importance approaches. The highest classification accuracy reported from thresholding was 60.67%. However, the temporal features were the best performing, with the highest balanced accuracy reported by the machine learning models: 95.71% with all frequency bands combined and a support vector machine classifier. Machine learning was much more effective than using individual features and could be a powerful aid in FS diagnosis. Furthermore, combining the frequency bands improved the accuracy of the classifiers in most cases, and the lowest performing EEG bands were consistently delta and gamma.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. This disorder slowly disintegrates thinking ability and changes behaviours of patients. These patients will show some psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder and movement disorder. These symptoms are in common with some other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and mood spectrum disorder. As patients would require immediate treatment, an on-time diagnosis is critical. This study explores the use of omics data in diagnosis of schizophrenia. Transcriptome, miRNA and epigenome data are used in diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia with the aid of machine learning algorithms. As the data is in high dimension, mutual information and feature importance are independently used for selecting relevant features for the study. Selected sets of features (biomarkers) are individually used with different machine learning algorithms and their performances are compared to select the best-performing model. This study shows that the top 140 miRNA features selected using mutual information along with support vector machines give the highest accuracy (0.86 ± 0.07) in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. All reported accuracies are validated using 5-fold cross validation. They are further validated using leave one out cross validation and the accuracies are reported in the supplementary material.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, the integration of modern technologies - such as electronic health records, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) - has revolutionized the collection, storage, and analysis of medical data in neurology. In epilepsy, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) are the most established biomarker, indicating an increased likelihood of seizures. Their detection traditionally relies on visual EEG assessment, a time-consuming and subjective process contributing to a high misdiagnosis rate. These limitations have spurred the development of automated AI-driven approaches aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency in IED detection. Research on automated IED detection began 45 years ago, spanning from morphological methods to deep learning techniques. In this review, we examine various IED detection approaches, evaluating their performance and limitations. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have produced the most promising results to date, and their application in IED detection continues to grow. Today, AI-driven tools are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, assisting clinicians in identifying abnormalities while reducing false-positive rates. To optimize the clinical implementation of automated AI-based IED detection, it is essential to render the codes publicly available and to standardize the datasets and metrics. Establishing uniform benchmarks will enable objective model comparisons and help determine which approaches are best suited for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in approximately 5 million deaths around the world with unprecedented consequences in people's daily routines and in the global economy. Despite vast increases in time and money spent on COVID-19-related research, there is still limited information about the factors at the country level that affected COVID-19 transmission and fatality in EU. The paper focuses on the identification of these risk factors using a machine learning (ML) predictive pipeline and an associated explainability analysis. To achieve this, a hybrid dataset was created employing publicly available sources comprising heterogeneous parameters from the majority of EU countries, e.g., mobility measures, policy responses, vaccinations, and demographics/generic country-level parameters. Data pre-processing and data exploration techniques were initially applied to normalize the available data and decrease the feature dimensionality of the data problem considered. Then, a linear ε-Support Vector Machine (ε-SVM) model was employed to implement the regression task of predicting the number of deaths for each one of the three first pandemic waves (with mean square error of 0.027 for wave 1 and less than 0.02 for waves 2 and 3). Post hoc explainability analysis was finally applied to uncover the rationale behind the decision-making mechanisms of the ML pipeline and thus enhance our understanding with respect to the contribution of the selected country-level parameters to the prediction of COVID-19 deaths in EU.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the classification of individuals as healthy or at risk of Parkinson's disease using machine learning (ML) models, focusing on the impact of dataset size and preprocessing techniques on model performance. Four datasets are created from an original dataset: [Formula: see text] (normal dataset), [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] subjected to Canny edge detection and Hessian filtering), [Formula: see text] (augmented [Formula: see text]), and [Formula: see text] (augmented [Formula: see text]). We evaluate a range of ML models-Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), XGBoost (XBG), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost (AdB)-on these datasets, analyzing prediction accuracy, model size, and prediction latency. The results show that while larger datasets lead to increased model memory footprints and prediction latencies, the Canny edge detection preprocessing supplemented by Hessian filtering (used in [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) degrades the performance of most models. In our experiment, we observe that Random Forest (RF) maintains a stable memory footprint of 61 KB across all datasets, while models like KNN and SVM show significant increases in memory usage, from 5.7-7 KB on [Formula: see text] to 102-220 KB on [Formula: see text], and similar increases in prediction time. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes show stable memory footprints and fast prediction times across all datasets. XGBoost's prediction time increases from 180-200 ms on [Formula: see text] to 700-3000 ms on [Formula: see text]. Statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test with 100 prediction accuracy observations per model (98 degrees of freedom) reveals significant differences in performance between models trained on [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (p-values < 1e-34 for most models), while the effect sizes measured by estimating Cliff's delta values (approaching [Formula: see text]) indicate large shifts in performance, especially for SVM and XGBoost. These findings highlight the importance of selecting lightweight models like LR and DT for deployment in resource-constrained healthcare applications, as models like KNN, SVM, and XGBoost show significant increases in resource demands with larger datasets, particularly when Canny preprocessing is applied.",

    "abstract": "A transmission hyperspectral microscopic imager (THMI) that utilizes machine learning algorithms for hyperspectral detection of microalgae is presented. The THMI system has excellent performance with spatial and spectral resolutions of 4 µm and 3 nm, respectively. We performed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of three species of microalgae to verify their absorption characteristics. Transmission spectra were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and peak ratio algorithms for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, and a support vector machine (SVM) model was used for classification. The average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to distinguish one species from the other two species were found to be 94.4%, 94.4% and 97.2%, respectively. A species identification experiment for a group of mixed microalgae in solution demonstrates the usability of the classification method. Using a random forest (RF) model, the growth stage in a phaeocystis growth cycle cultivated under laboratory conditions was predicted with an accuracy of 98.1%, indicating the feasibility to evaluate the growth state of microalgae through their transmission spectra. Experimental results show that the THMI system has the capability for classification, identification and growth stage estimation of microalgae, with strong potential for in-situ marine environmental monitoring and early warning detection applications.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in biomass gasification modeling. However, a significant drawback of the machine learning approaches is their poor physical interpretability when relying on limited experimental data. In the present work, a physics-informed neural network method (PINN) is developed to predict biomass gasification products (N , H , CO, CO , and CH ). PINN simultaneously considers regression, structure, and physical monotonicity constraints in the loss function, providing physically feasible predictions. Specifically, the PINN models have outperformed prediction capability (average test R 0.91-0.97) compared to five other machine learning methods through 50 times random sample classifications. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the developed models can maintain correct monotonicity even if the feedstock characteristics or gasification conditions are outside the training data. By using a reliable physical mechanism to guide machine learning, the model can ensure better generalizability and scientific interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Helices are important secondary structural motifs within proteins and are pivotal in numerous physiological processes. While amino acids (AA) such as alanine and leucine are known to promote helix formation, proline and glycine disfavor it. Helical structure formation, however, also depends on its environment, and hence, prior prediction of a mutational effect on a helical structure is difficult. Here, we employ a reinforcement learning algorithm to develop a predictive model for helix-disrupting mutations. We start with a model to disrupt helices independent of their protein environment. Our results show that only a few mutations lead to a drastic disruption of the target helix. We further extend our approach to helices in proteins and validate the results using rigorous free energy calculations. Our strategy identifies amino acids crucial for maintaining structural integrity and predicts key mutations that could alter protein structure. Through our work, we present a new use case for reinforcement learning in protein structure disruption.",

The article contributes in two primary ways: 1) validating the effectiveness of using a minimally invasive electroencephalography (EEG) device combined with machine learning techniques to control fundamental movements in a robotic setting, and 2) demonstrating these findings practically through the construction of a robotic vehicle. In this vehicle, tasks involving motor imagery align directly with control commands for the vehicle. To validate our approach, we identified four-class and two-class classification tasks. The signals have been acquired from a portable EEG device equipped with eight dry electrodes. We employed sliding window strategies to segment the data, along with feature extraction using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) method. Classification modules were implemented based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models. The experimentation involved five participants, each with their own personalized model. While the accuracy of results in the four-class tasks is not notably high, the outcomes in binary classification tasks are promising, boasting an average accuracy of approximately 61%. Results suggest a promising potential for this approach in the realm of robot control, particularly when employing dry-electrode EEG devices.",

By combining accurate models with interpretable insights, explainable machine learning promises to accelerate data-driven cancer pharmacology. However, owing to the highly correlated and high-dimensional nature of transcriptomic data, naively applying current explainable machine-learning strategies to large transcriptomic datasets leads to suboptimal outcomes. Here by using feature attribution methods, we show that the quality of the explanations can be increased by leveraging ensembles of explainable machine-learning models. We applied the approach to a dataset of 133 combinations of 46 anticancer drugs tested in ex vivo tumour samples from 285 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and uncovered a haematopoietic-differentiation signature underlying drug combinations with therapeutic synergy. Ensembles of machine-learning models trained to predict drug combination synergies on the basis of gene-expression data may improve the feature attribution quality of complex machine-learning models.",

    "title": "Algorithms and Techniques for the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridges: Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are used to analyze the health of infrastructures such as bridges, using data from various types of sensors. While SHM systems consist of various stages, feature extraction and pattern recognition steps are the most important. Consequently, signal processing techniques in the feature extraction stage and machine learning algorithms in the pattern recognition stage play an effective role in analyzing the health of bridges. In other words, there exists a plethora of signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, and the selection of the appropriate technique/algorithm is guided by the limitations of each technique/algorithm. The selection also depends on the requirements of SHM in terms of damage identification level and operating conditions. This has provided the motivation to conduct a Systematic literature review (SLR) of feature extraction techniques and pattern recognition algorithms for the structural health monitoring of bridges. The existing literature reviews describe the current trends in the field with different focus aspects. However, a systematic literature review that presents an in-depth comparative study of different applications of machine learning algorithms in the field of SHM of bridges does not exist. Furthermore, there is a lack of analytical studies that investigate the SHM systems in terms of several design considerations including feature extraction techniques, analytical approaches (classification/ regression), operational functionality levels (diagnosis/prognosis) and system implementation techniques (data-driven/model-based). Consequently, this paper identifies 45 recent research practices (during 2016-2023), pertaining to feature extraction techniques and pattern recognition algorithms in SHM for bridges through an SLR process. First, the identified research studies are classified into three different categories: supervised learning algorithms, neural networks and a combination of both. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of various machine learning algorithms is performed in each category. Moreover, the analysis of selected research studies (total = 45) in terms of feature extraction techniques is made, and 25 different techniques are identified. Furthermore, this article also explores other design considerations like analytical approaches in the pattern recognition process, operational functionality and system implementation. It is expected that the outcomes of this research may facilitate the researchers and practitioners of the domain during the selection of appropriate feature extraction techniques, machine learning algorithms and other design considerations according to the SHM system requirements.",

    "title": "Evaluating resampling methods and structured features to improve fall incident report identification by the severity level.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to improve the classification of the fall incident severity level by considering data imbalance issues and structured features through machine learning. We present an incident report classification (IRC) framework to classify the in-hospital fall incident severity level by addressing the imbalanced class problem and incorporating structured attributes. After text preprocessing, bag-of-words features, structured text features, and structured clinical features were extracted from the reports. Next, resampling techniques were incorporated into the training process. Machine learning algorithms were used to build classification models. IRC systems were trained, validated, and tested using a repeated and randomly stratified shuffle-split cross-validation method. Finally, we evaluated the system performance using the F1-measure, precision, and recall over 15 stratified test sets. The experimental results demonstrated that the classification system setting considering both data imbalance issues and structured features outperformed the other system settings (with a mean macro-averaged F1-measure of 0.733). Considering the structured features and resampling techniques, this classification system setting significantly improved the mean F1-measure for the rare class by 30.88% (P value < .001) and the mean macro-averaged F1-measure by 8.26% from the baseline system setting (P value < .001). In general, the classification system employing the random forest algorithm and random oversampling method outperformed the others. Structured features provide essential information for categorizing the fall incident severity level. Resampling methods help rebalance the class distribution of the original incident report data, which improves the performance of machine learning models. The IRC framework presented in this study effectively automates the identification of fall incident reports by the severity level.",

Under optimal conditions, Rp for moisture, caffeine, tea polyphenols, and tea polysaccharides were 0.9678, 0.9757, 0.7569, and 0.8185, respectively. The values of SEP were less than 0.9302, and absolute values of Bias were less than 0.3667.

    "abstract": "Soil heavy metal contamination was a global environmental issue that posed adverse impacts on ecological and human health risks. The controlling of soil heavy metal is mainly focused on the emission source and pipe-end treatment, less is known about the intermediate controlling process. The migration route of heavy metals exhibited the spatial evolution of pollutants from the sources to the pipe-end, which provided the more reasonable location for the target-oriented treatment of soil heavy metal. Here, we proposed a new view of heavy metal similarity, which quantitatively expressed how closely of the contaminations between the study area and the test areas. We found that the similarity of different heavy metals was unequally distributed across locations that were related with five main sources, namely agricultural activities, natural sources, traffic emissions, industrial activities, and other sources. Based on the similarity, a state-of-the-art machine learning method was applied to delineate the migration route of soil heavy metals. Thereinto, As was concentrated around livestock farms, and its migration route was close to the water system. Cd migration route was over-dispersed in the areas where located mine fields and chemical plants. Migration routes of Hg and Pb were along rivers, which were related to agricultural activities and natural sources. Overall, the perspective on similarity and migration routes provided theoretical basis and method to alleviate soil heavy metal pollution at regional scale and can be extended across largescale regions.",

Novel image analysis approaches have enabled us to capture patterns from images imperceptible by the human eye. This rich source of data can be combined with a range of clinical features, holding the potential to be a noninvasive source of biomarkers. Applications of radiomics in skull base pathologies have centered around three common tumor classes: meningioma, sellar/parasellar tumors, and vestibular schwannomas. Radiomic investigations can be categorized into five domains: tumor detection/segmentation, classification between tumor types, tumor grading, detection of tumor features, and prognostication. Various computational architectures have been employed across these domains, with deep-learning methods becoming more common versus machine learning. Across radiomic applications, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI images remain the most utilized sequence for model development. Efforts to standardize and connect radiomic features to tumor biology have facilitated more clinically applicable radiomic models. Despite the advancement in model performance, several challenges continue to hinder translatability, including small sample sizes and model training on homogenous single institution data. To recognize the potential of radiomics for skull base oncology, prospective, multi-institutional collaboration will be the cornerstone for a validated radiomic technology.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing trend of building larger wind turbines (WT) to reach greater economies of scale is contributing to the reduction in cost of wind energy, as well as the increase in WT drivetrain input loads into uncharted territories. The resulting intensification of the load situation within the WT gearbox motivates the need to monitor WT transmission input loads. However, due to the high costs of direct measurement solutions, more economical solutions, such as virtual sensing of transmission input loads using stationary sensors mounted on the gearbox housing or other drivetrain locations, are of interest. As the number, type, and location of sensors needed for a virtual sensing solutions can vary considerably in cost, in this investigation, we aimed to identify optimal sensor locations for virtually sensing WT 6-degree of freedom (6-DOF) transmission input loads. Random forest (RF) models were designed and applied to a dataset containing simulated operational data of a Vestas V52 WT multibody simulation model undergoing simulated wind fields. The dataset contained the 6-DOF transmission input loads and signals from potential sensor locations covering deformations, misalignments, and rotational speeds at various drivetrain locations. The RF models were used to identify the sensor locations with the highest impact on accuracy of virtual load sensing following a known statistical test in order to prioritize and reduce the number of needed input signals. The performance of the models was assessed before and after reducing the number of input signals required. By allowing for a screening of sensors prior to real-world tests, the results demonstrate the high promise of the proposed method for optimizing the cost of future virtual WT transmission load sensors.",

The LCP descriptor is generated from the coordinates of the polar hydrogen and heavy atoms of the docked ligand. We hypothesize that the prediction of binding poses can be enhanced through the combination of machine learning methods with the LCP descriptor. Two docking programs were used to predict ligand docking against xanthine oxidase. Four machine learning methods-k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and LightGBM-were used to determine whether machine learning-based models could be used to accurately identify the correct binding poses. Regardless of the machine learning method employed, the LCP descriptor demonstrated improved performance compared to the existing descriptor. The results of the leave-one-pdb-out approach revealed that the influence of the pose descriptor was also significant, as demonstrated through cross-validation. When evaluated using top-N metrics, the machine learning models were generally more effective than the docking programs. In addition, the LCP-based models outperformed those based on the existing descriptor. The results obtained in this study suggest that our proposed binding pose descriptor is effective for improving the docking accuracy of xanthine oxidase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on a problem important to automatic machine learning: the automatic processing of a nonpreprocessed time series. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular neural network (NN) algorithms for pattern recognition. Seasonal time series with trends are the most common data sets used in forecasting. Both the convolutional layer and the pooling layer of a CNN can be used to extract important features and patterns that reflect the seasonality, trends, and time lag correlation coefficients in the data. The ability to identify such features and patterns makes CNN a good candidate algorithm for analyzing seasonal time-series data with trends. This article reports our experimental findings using a fully connected NN (FNN), a nonpooling CNN (NPCNN), and a CNN to study both simulated and real time-series data with seasonality and trends. We found that convolutional layers tend to improve the performance, while pooling layers tend to introduce too many negative effects. Therefore, we recommend using an NPCNN when processing seasonal time-series data with trends. Moreover, we suggest using the Adam optimizer and selecting either a rectified linear unit (ReLU) function or a linear activation function. Using an NN to analyze seasonal time series with trends has become popular in the NN community. This article provides an approach for building a network that fits time-series data with seasonality and trends automatically.",

In this study, a machine learning model was built to predict and classify the presence or absence of SAPS in assembly workers with shoulder joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength data using support vector machine (SVM). Permutation importance was used to determine important variables for predicting workers with or without SAPS. The accuracy of the support vector classifier (SVC) polynomial model for classifying workers with SAPS was 82.4%. The important variables in model construction were internal rotation and abduction of shoulder ROM and internal rotation of shoulder muscle strength. It is possible to accurately perform SAPS classification of workers with relatively easy-to-obtain shoulder ROM and muscle strength data using this model. In addition, preventing SAPS in workers is possible by adjusting the factors affecting model building using exercise or rehabilitation programs. This study aimed to create a machine learning model that can predict and classify SAPS using shoulder ROM and muscle strength and identify the variables that are of high importance in model construction.

In these cases, surrogate measures can be used to make estimations by means of data-driven models. In this work, variables that are commonly measured in-situ are used as surrogates to estimate the concentrations of nutrients in a rural catchment and in an urban one, making use of machine learning models, specifically Random Forests. The results are compared with those of linear modelling using the same number of surrogates, obtaining a reduction in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of up to 60.1%. The profit from including up to seven surrogate sensors was computed, concluding that adding more than 4 and 5 sensors in each of the catchments respectively was not worthy in terms of error improvement.",

    "title": "Adap-BDCM: Adaptive Bilinear Dynamic Cascade Model for Classification Tasks on CNV Datasets.",
    "abstract": "Copy number variation (CNV) is an essential genetic driving factor of cancer formation and progression, making intelligent classification based on CNV feasible. However, there are a few challenges in the current machine learning and deep learning methods, such as the design of base classifier combination schemes in ensemble methods and the selection of layers of neural networks, which often result in low accuracy. Therefore, an adaptive bilinear dynamic cascade model (Adap-BDCM) is developed to further enhance the accuracy and applicability of these methods for intelligent classification on CNV datasets. In this model, a feature selection module is introduced to mitigate the interference of redundant information, and a bilinear model based on the gated attention mechanism is proposed to extract more beneficial deep fusion features. Furthermore, an adaptive base classifier selection scheme is designed to overcome the difficulty of manually designing base classifier combinations and enhance the applicability of the model. Lastly, a novel feature fusion scheme with an attribute recall submodule is constructed, effectively avoiding getting stuck in local solutions and missing some valuable information. Numerous experiments have demonstrated that our Adap-BDCM model exhibits optimal performance in cancer classification, stage prediction, and recurrence on CNV datasets. This study can assist physicians in making diagnoses faster and better.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to build a machine learning model that can predict healing of diabetes-related foot ulcers, using both clinical attributes extracted from electronic health records (EHR) and image features extracted from photographs. The clinical information and photographs were collected at an academic podiatry wound clinic over a three-year period. Both hand-crafted color and texture features and deep learning-based features from the global average pooling layer of ResNet-50 were extracted from the wound photographs. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were then trained for prediction. For prediction of eventual wound healing, the models built with hand-crafted imaging features alone outperformed models built with clinical or deep-learning features alone. Models trained with all features performed comparatively against models trained with hand-crafted imaging features. Utilization of smartphone and tablet photographs taken outside of research settings hold promise for predicting prognosis of diabetes-related foot ulcers.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches to problem-solving are growing rapidly within healthcare, and radiation oncology is no exception. With the burgeoning interest in machine learning comes the significant risk of misaligned expectations as to what it can and cannot accomplish. This paper evaluates the role of machine learning and the problems it solves within the context of current clinical challenges in radiation oncology. The role of learning algorithms within the workflow for external beam radiation therapy are surveyed, considering simulation imaging, multimodal fusion, image segmentation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery and adaptation. For each aspect, the clinical challenges faced, the learning algorithms proposed, and the successes and limitations of various approaches are analyzed. It is observed that machine learning has largely thrived on reproducibly mimicking conventional human-driven solutions with more efficiency and consistency. On the other hand, since algorithms are generally trained using expert opinion as ground truth, machine learning is of limited utility where problems or ground truths are not well-defined, or if suitable measures of correctness are not available. As a result, machines may excel at replicating, automating and standardizing human behaviour on manual chores, meanwhile the conceptual clinical challenges relating to definition, evaluation, and judgement remain in the realm of human intelligence and insight.",

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning-based medical image computing applications necessitate expert label curation, while unlabelled image data might be relatively abundant. Active learning methods aim to prioritise a subset of available image data for expert annotation, for label-efficient model training. We develop a controller neural network that measures priority of images in a sequence of batches, as in batch-mode active learning, for multi-class segmentation tasks. The controller is optimised by rewarding positive task-specific performance gain, within a Markov decision process (MDP) environment that also optimises the task predictor. In this work, the task predictor is a segmentation network. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed with multiple MDPs, such that the pre-trained controller can be adapted to a new MDP that contains data from different institutes and/or requires segmentation of different organs or structures within the abdomen. We present experimental results using multiple CT datasets from more than one thousand patients, with segmentation tasks of nine different abdominal organs, to demonstrate the efficacy of the learnt prioritisation controller function and its cross-institute and cross-organ adaptability. We show that the proposed adaptable prioritisation metric yields converging segmentation accuracy for a new kidney segmentation task, unseen in training, using between approximately 40% to 60% of labels otherwise required with other heuristic or random prioritisation metrics. For clinical datasets of limited size, the proposed adaptable prioritisation offers a performance improvement of 22.6% and 10.2% in Dice score, for tasks of kidney and liver vessel segmentation, respectively, compared to random prioritisation and alternative active sampling strategies.",

In supervised learning applications, all these models map inputs into a predicted output and then model the discrepancy between predicted values and the real output according to a loss function. The parameters of the mapping function are then optimized through the process of gradient descent and backward propagation in order to minimize this loss.

    "abstract": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus works as an important protocol in the real-time In-Vehicle Network (IVN) systems for its simple, suitable, and robust architecture. The risk of IVN devices has still been insecure and vulnerable due to the complex data-intensive architectures which greatly increase the accessibility to unauthorized networks and the possibility of various types of cyberattacks. Therefore, the detection of cyberattacks in IVN devices has become a growing interest. With the rapid development of IVNs and evolving threat types, the traditional machine learning-based IDS has to update to cope with the security requirements of the current environment. Nowadays, the progression of deep learning, deep transfer learning, and its impactful outcome in several areas has guided as an effective solution for network intrusion detection. This manuscript proposes a deep transfer learning-based IDS model for IVN along with improved performance in comparison to several other existing models. The unique contributions include effective attribute selection which is best suited to identify malicious CAN messages and accurately detect the normal and abnormal activities, designing a deep transfer learning-based LeNet model, and evaluating considering real-world data. To this end, an extensive experimental performance evaluation has been conducted. The architecture along with empirical analyses shows that the proposed IDS greatly improves the detection accuracy over the mainstream machine learning, deep learning, and benchmark deep transfer learning models and has demonstrated better performance for real-time IVN security.",

All systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional randomized controlled trials cited in recent clinical guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association (2 guidelines), and American Stroke Association were assessed. After reproducing the primary screening data set according to the published search strategy of each, we extracted correct articles (those actually reviewed) and incorrect articles (those not reviewed) from the data set. These 2 sets of articles were used to train a neural network-based artificial intelligence engine (Concept Encoder, Fronteo Inc). The primary endpoint was work saved over sampling at 95% recall (WSS@95%). Among 145 candidate reviews of randomized controlled trials, 8 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For these 8 reviews, the machine learning system significantly reduced the literature screening workload by at least 6-fold versus that of manual screening based on WSS@95%. When machine learning was initiated using 2 correct articles that were randomly selected by a researcher, a 10-fold reduction in workload was achieved versus that of manual screening based on the WSS@95% value, with high sensitivity for eligible studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased dramatically every time the algorithm learned a correct article. Concept Encoder achieved a 10-fold reduction of the screening workload for systematic review after learning from 2 randomly selected studies on the target topic. However, few meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included. Concept Encoder could facilitate the acquisition of evidence for clinical guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic peptides are versatile therapeutic agents that boast high binding affinity, minimal toxicity, and the potential to engage challenging protein targets. However, the pharmaceutical utility of cyclic peptides is limited by their low membrane permeability-an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting. Current machine learning-based models of cyclic peptide permeability show variable performance owing to the limitations of experimental data. Furthermore, these methods use features derived from the whole molecule that have traditionally been used to predict small molecules and ignore the unique structural properties of cyclic peptides. This study presents CycPeptMP: an accurate and efficient method to predict cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We designed features for cyclic peptides at the atom-, monomer-, and peptide-levels and seamlessly integrated these into a fusion model using deep learning technology. Additionally, we applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance model training efficiency using the latest data. The fusion model exhibited excellent prediction performance for the logarithm of permeability, with a mean absolute error of $0.355$ and correlation coefficient of $0.883$. Ablation studies demonstrated that all feature levels contributed and were relatively essential to predicting membrane permeability, confirming the effectiveness of augmentation to improve prediction accuracy. A comparison with a molecular dynamics-based method showed that CycPeptMP accurately predicted peptide permeability, which is otherwise difficult to predict using simulations.",

    "abstract": "IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is a disease of the glomeruli that may eventually lead to chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. The signs and symptoms of IgAN nephropathy are usually not specific enough and are similar to those of other glomerular or inflammatory diseases. This makes a correct diagnosis more difficult. This study collected data from a sample of adult patients diagnosed with primary IgAN at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, with proteinuria ≥1 g/d at the time of diagnosis. Based on these samples, we propose a machine learning framework based on weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO). An enhanced COINFO algorithm is proposed by merging INFO, Cauchy Mutation (CM) and Oppositional-based Learning (OBL) strategies. At the same time, COINFO and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were integrated to construct the BCOINFO-SVM framework for IgAN diagnosis and prediction. Initially, the proposed enhanced COINFO is evaluated using the IEEE CEC2017 benchmark problems, with the outcomes demonstrating its efficient optimization capability and accuracy in convergence. Furthermore, the feature selection capability of the proposed method is verified on the public medical datasets. Finally, the auxiliary diagnostic experiment was carried out through IgAN real sample data. The results demonstrate that the proposed BCOINFO-SVM can screen out essential features such as High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Uric Acid (UA), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), Hypertension and Diabetes. Simultaneously, the BCOINFO-SVM model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, with sensitivity at 96.08% and specificity at 97.73%, making it a potential auxiliary diagnostic model for IgAN.",

    "title": "Detecting noncredible symptomology in ADHD evaluations using machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Diagnostic evaluations for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are becoming increasingly complicated by the number of adults who fabricate or exaggerate symptoms. Novel methods are needed to improve the assessment process required to detect these noncredible symptoms. The present study investigated whether unsupervised machine learning (ML) could serve as one such method, and detect noncredible symptom reporting in adults undergoing ADHD evaluations. Participants were 623 adults who underwent outpatient ADHD evaluations. Patients' scores from symptom validity tests embedded in two self-report questionnaires were examined in an unsupervised ML model. The model, called \"sidClustering,\" is based on a clustering and random forest algorithm. The model synthesized the raw scores (without cutoffs) from the symptom validity tests into an unspecified number of groups. The groups were then compared to predetermined ratings of credible versus noncredible symptom reporting. The noncredible symptom ratings were defined by either two or three or more symptom validity test elevations. The model identified two groups that were significantly ( < .001) and meaningfully associated with the predetermined ratings of credible or noncredible symptom reporting, regardless of the number of elevations used to define noncredible reporting. The validity test assessing overreporting of various types of psychiatric symptoms was most influential in determining group membership; but symptom validity tests regarding ADHD-specific symptoms were also contributory. These findings suggest that unsupervised ML can effectively identify noncredible symptom reporting using scores from multiple symptom validity tests without predetermined cutoffs. The ML-derived groups also support the use of two validity test elevations to identify noncredible symptom reporting. Collectively, these findings serve as a proof of concept that unsupervised ML can improve the process of detecting noncredible symptoms during ADHD evaluations. With additional research, unsupervised ML may become a useful supplementary tool for quickly and accurately detecting noncredible symptoms during these evaluations.",

    "title": "Piece-wise quadratic approximations of arbitrary error functions for fast and robust machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Most of machine learning approaches have stemmed from the application of minimizing the mean squared distance principle, based on the computationally efficient quadratic optimization methods. However, when faced with high-dimensional and noisy data, the quadratic error functionals demonstrated many weaknesses including high sensitivity to contaminating factors and dimensionality curse. Therefore, a lot of recent applications in machine learning exploited properties of non-quadratic error functionals based on L norm or even sub-linear potentials corresponding to quasinorms L (0<p<1). The back side of these approaches is increase in computational cost for optimization. Till so far, no approaches have been suggested to deal with arbitrary error functionals, in a flexible and computationally efficient framework. In this paper, we develop a theory and basic universal data approximation algorithms (k-means, principal components, principal manifolds and graphs, regularized and sparse regression), based on piece-wise quadratic error potentials of subquadratic growth (PQSQ potentials). We develop a new and universal framework to minimize arbitrary sub-quadratic error potentials using an algorithm with guaranteed fast convergence to the local or global error minimum. The theory of PQSQ potentials is based on the notion of the cone of minorant functions, and represents a natural approximation formalism based on the application of min-plus algebra. The approach can be applied in most of existing machine learning methods, including methods of data approximation and regularized and sparse regression, leading to the improvement in the computational cost/accuracy trade-off. We demonstrate that on synthetic and real-life datasets PQSQ-based machine learning methods achieve orders of magnitude faster computational performance than the corresponding state-of-the-art methods, having similar or better approximation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury occurs commonly and is a leading cause of prolonged hospitalization, development and progression of chronic kidney disease, and death. Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury. A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation. The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two-hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours).

    "abstract": "Influent flow to the 75 mgd Neuse River Resource Recovery Facility (NRRRF) was modeled using machine learning. The trained model can predict hourly flow 72 h in advance. This model was deployed in July 2020, and has been in operation over two and a half years. The model's mean absolute error in training was 2.6 mgd, and mean absolute error has ranged from 10 to 13 mgd in deployment for any point during the wet weather event when predicting 12 h in advance. As a result of this tool, plant staff have optimized the use of their 32 MG wet weather equalization basin, using it approximately 10 times and never exceeding its volume. PRACTITIONER POINTS: A machine learning model was developed to predict influent flow to a WRF 72 h in advance. Selecting the appropriate model, variables, and properly characterizing the system are important considerations in machine learning modeling. This model was developed using free open source software/code (Python) and deployed securely using an automated Cloud-based data pipeline. This tool has been in operation for over 30 months and continues to make accurate predictions. Machine learning combined with subject matter expertise can greatly benefit the water industry.",

    "title": "Studies of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: Cross-Sectional Study With Temporal Trends, 2010-2023.",
    "abstract": "The rapid growth of research in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continues. However, it is unclear whether this growth reflects an increase in desirable study attributes or merely perpetuates the same issues previously raised in the literature. This study aims to evaluate temporal trends in AI/ML studies over time and identify variations that are not apparent from aggregated totals at a single point in time. We identified AI/ML studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with start dates between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2023. Studies were included if AI/ML-specific terms appeared in the official title, detailed description, brief summary, intervention, primary outcome, or sponsors' keywords. Studies registered as systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. We reported trends in AI/ML studies over time, along with study characteristics that were fast-growing and those that remained unchanged during 2010-2023. Of 3106 AI/ML studies, only 7.6% (n=235) were regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. The most common study characteristics were randomized (56.2%; 670/1193; interventional) and prospective (58.9%; 1126/1913; observational) designs; a focus on diagnosis (28.2%; 335/1190) and treatment (24.4%; 290/1190); hospital/clinic (44.2%; 1373/3106) or academic (28%; 869/3106) sponsorship; and neoplasm (12.9%; 420/3245), nervous system (12.2%; 395/3245), cardiovascular (11.1%; 356/3245) or pathological conditions (10%; 325/3245; multiple counts per study possible). Enrollment data were skewed to the right: maximum 13,977,257; mean 16,962 (SD 288,155); median 255 (IQR 80-1000). The most common size category was 101-1000 (44.8%; 1372/3061; excluding withdrawn or missing), but large studies (n>1000) represented 24.1% (738/3061) of all studies: 29% (551/1898) of observational studies and 16.1% (187/1163) of trials. Study locations were predominantly in high-income countries (75.3%; 2340/3106), followed by upper-middle-income (21.7%; 675/3106), lower-middle-income (2.8%; 88/3106), and low-income countries (0.1%; 3/3106). The fastest-growing characteristics over time were high-income countries (location); Europe, Asia, and North America (location); diagnosis and treatment (primary purpose); hospital/clinic and academia (lead sponsor); randomized and prospective designs; and the 1-100 and 101-1000 size categories. Only 5.6% (47/842) of completed studies had results available on ClinicalTrials.gov, and this pattern persisted. Over time, there was an increase in not only the number of newly initiated studies, but also the number of completed studies without posted results. Much of the rapid growth in AI/ML studies comes from high-income countries in high-resource settings, albeit with a modest increase in upper-middle-income countries (mostly China). Lower-middle-income or low-income countries remain poorly represented. The increase in randomized or prospective designs, along with 738 large studies (n>1000), mostly ongoing, may indicate that enough studies are shifting from an in silico evaluation stage toward a prospective comparative evaluation stage. However, the ongoing limited availability of basic results on ClinicalTrials.gov contrasts with this field's rapid advancements and the public registry's role in reducing publication and outcome reporting biases.",

Common methods for activity recognition rely on supervised learning requiring substantial amounts of labeled training data. Obtaining accurate and detailed annotations of activities is challenging, preventing the applicability of these approaches in real-world settings. This paper proposes new annotation strategies that substantially reduce the required amount of annotation. We explore two learning schemes for activity recognition that effectively leverage such sparsely labeled data together with more easily obtainable unlabeled data. Experimental results on two public data sets indicate that both approaches obtain results close to fully supervised techniques. The proposed methods are robust to the presence of erroneous labels occurring in real-world annotation data.",

Digital Twin and Cyber-Physical Systems in Industry 4.0 are key techniques to develop digital manufacturing. Since it is very difficult to create high-fidelity virtual models, the development of digital manufacturing for aircraft manufacturers is challenging. In this study, we provide a view from a data simulation perspective and adopt machine learning approaches to simplify the high-fidelity virtual models in Digital Twin. The novel concept is called Data Twin, and the deployable service to support the simulation is known as the Data Twin Service (DTS). Relying on the DTS, we also propose a microservice software architecture, Cyber-Physical Factory (CPF), to simulate the shop floor environment. Additionally, there are two war rooms in the CPF that can be used to establish a collaborative platform: one is the Physical War Room, used to integrate real data, and the other is the Cyber War Room for handling simulation data and the results of the CPF.",

    "title": "Phylogenetic inference using generative adversarial networks.",
    "abstract": "The application of machine learning approaches in phylogenetics has been impeded by the vast model space associated with inference. Supervised machine learning approaches require data from across this space to train models. Because of this, previous approaches have typically been limited to inferring relationships among unrooted quartets of taxa, where there are only three possible topologies. Here, we explore the potential of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address this limitation. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator: at each step, the generator aims to create data that is similar to real data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish generated and real data. By using an evolutionary model as the generator, we use GANs to make evolutionary inferences. Since a new model can be considered at each iteration, heuristic searches of complex model spaces are possible. Thus, GANs offer a potential solution to the challenges of applying machine learning in phylogenetics. We developed phyloGAN, a GAN that infers phylogenetic relationships among species. phyloGAN takes as input a concatenated alignment, or a set of gene alignments, and infers a phylogenetic tree either considering or ignoring gene tree heterogeneity. We explored the performance of phyloGAN for up to 15 taxa in the concatenation case and 6 taxa when considering gene tree heterogeneity. Error rates are relatively low in these simple cases. However, run times are slow and performance metrics suggest issues during training. Future work should explore novel architectures that may result in more stable and efficient GANs for phylogenetics. phyloGAN is available on github: https://github.com/meganlsmith/phyloGAN/.",

    "title": "Do machine learning methods solve the main pitfall of linear regression in dental age estimation?",
    "abstract": "Age estimation is crucial in forensic and anthropological fields. Teeth, are valued for their resilience to environmental factors and their preservation over time, making them essential for age estimation when other skeletal remains deteriorate. Recently, Machine Learning algorithms have been used in age estimation, demonstrating high levels of accuracy. However, their precision with respect to the trend of age estimation error, typical in some traditional methods like linear regression, has not been thoroughly investigated. To evaluate and compare the performance of frequently used Machine Learning-assisted methods against two traditional age estimation methods, linear regression and the Segmented Normal Bayesian Calibration model. Overall, 1.949 orthopantomographs from black and white South African children aged 5-14 years, with 49 % males, were evaluated. The performance of Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and the Gradient Boosting Method were compared against traditional linear regression and the Segmented Normal Bayesian Calibration model. The comparison was based on accuracy measures, including Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error, and precision measures, including the Inter-Quartile Range of the error distribution and the slope of the estimated age error relative to chronological age. The Machine Learning methods outperformed linear regression and the Segmented Normal Bayesian Calibration models in terms of accuracy, although the differences were small. Gradient Boosting Method and Support Vector Regression achieved the highest levels of accuracy (Mean Absolute Error: 0.69 years, Root Mean Squared Error: 0.85 years). All Machine Learning methods and linear regression exhibited significant bias in residuals, whereas the Segmented Normal Bayesian Calibration model showed no significant bias. Gender-stratified analyses revealed similar results in terms of the accuracy and precision of all considered models. Although Machine Learning methods demonstrate high levels of accuracy, they may be prone to trends in error distribution when estimating dental age. Evaluating this error is crucial and should be an integral part of model performance evaluation. Future research should aim to improve accuracy while rigorously addressing systematic biases.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient prediction of polymers properties is crucial for polymer design. Recently, data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated great promise in polymers property analysis. Even with the great progresses, a pivotal challenge in all the AI-driven models remains to be the effective representation of molecules. Here we introduce Multi-Cover Persistence (MCP)-based molecular representation and featurization for the first time. Our MCP-based polymer descriptors are combined with machine learning models, in particular, Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) models, for polymers property prediction. Different from all previous molecular representation, polymer molecular structure and interactions are represented as MCP, which utilizes Delaunay slices at different dimensions and Rhomboid tiling to characterize the complicated geometric and topological information within the data. Statistic features from the generated persistent barcodes are used as polymer descriptors, and further combined with GBT model. Our model has been extensively validated on polymer benchmark datasets. It has been found that our models can outperform traditional fingerprint-based models and has similar accuracy with geometric deep learning models. In particular, our model tends to be more effective on large-sized monomer structures, demonstrating the great potential of MCP in characterizing more complicated polymer data. This work underscores the potential of MCP in polymer informatics, presenting a novel perspective on molecular representation and its application in polymer science.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. The use of machine learning systems to detect respiratory diseases non-invasive measures such as physical and laboratory parameters is gaining momentum and has been proposed to decrease diagnostic uncertainty associated with bacterial pneumonia. Herein, this study conducted several experiments using eight machine learning models to predict pneumonia based on biomarkers, laboratory parameters, and physical features. We perform machine-learning analysis on 535 different patients, each with 45 features. Data normalization to rescale all real-valued features was performed. Since it is a binary problem, we categorized each patient into one class at a time. We designed three experiments to evaluate the models: (1) feature selection techniques to select appropriate features for the models, (2) experiments on the imbalanced original dataset, and (3) experiments on the SMOTE data. We then compared eight machine learning models to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting pneumonia. Biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin demonstrated the most significant discriminating power. Ensemble machine learning models such as RF (accuracy = 92.0%, precision = 91.3%, recall = 96.0%, f1-Score = 93.6%) and XGBoost (accuracy = 90.8%, precision = 92.6%, recall = 92.3%, f1-score = 92.4%) achieved the highest performance accuracy on the original dataset with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. On the SMOTE dataset, RF and XGBoost achieved the highest prediction results with f1-scores of 92.0 and 91.2%, respectively. Also, AUC of 0.97 was achieved for both RF and XGBoost models. Our models showed that in the diagnosis of pneumonia, individual clinical history, laboratory indicators, and symptoms do not have adequate discriminatory power. We can also conclude that the ensemble ML models performed better in this study.",

    "abstract": "With information systems worldwide being attacked daily, analogies from traditional warfare are apt, and deception tactics have historically proven effective as both a strategy and a technique for Defense. Defensive Deception includes thinking like an attacker and determining the best strategy to counter common attack strategies. Defensive Deception tactics are beneficial at introducing uncertainty for adversaries, increasing their learning costs, and, as a result, lowering the likelihood of successful attacks. In cybersecurity, honeypots and honeytokens and camouflaging and moving target defense commonly employ Defensive Deception tactics. For a variety of purposes, deceptive and anti-deceptive technologies have been created. However, there is a critical need for a broad, comprehensive and quantitative framework that can help us deploy advanced deception technologies. Computational intelligence provides an appropriate set of tools for creating advanced deception frameworks. Computational intelligence comprises two significant families of artificial intelligence technologies: deep learning and machine learning. These strategies can be used in various situations in Defensive Deception technologies. This survey focuses on Defensive Deception tactics deployed using the help of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Prior work has yielded insights, lessons, and limitations presented in this study. It culminates with a discussion about future directions, which helps address the important gaps in present Defensive Deception research.",

This study investigates the effects of food contamination on gastrointestinal-disease morbidities using eight different machine-learning models, including multiple linear regression, a shallow neural network, and three deep neural networks and their improved versions trained by an evolutionary algorithm. Experiments on the datasets from ten cities/counties in central China demonstrate that deep neural networks achieve significantly higher accuracy than classical linear-regression and shallow neural-network models, and the deep denoising autoencoder model with evolutionary learning exhibits the best prediction performance. The results also indicate that the prediction accuracies on acute gastrointestinal diseases are generally higher than those on other diseases, but the models are difficult to predict the morbidities of gastrointestinal tumors. This study demonstrates that evolutionary deep-learning models can be utilized to accurately predict the morbidities of most gastrointestinal diseases from food contamination, and this approach can be extended for the morbidity prediction of many other diseases.",

It is hitherto unknown why deep neural networks are easily optimizable. We analyze the energy landscape of a spin glass model of deep neural networks using random matrix theory and algebraic geometry. We analytically show that the multilayered structure holds the key to optimizability: Fixing the number of parameters and increasing network depth, the number of stationary points in the loss function decreases, minima become more clustered in parameter space, and the trade-off between the depth and width of minima becomes less severe. Our analytical results are numerically verified through comparison with neural networks trained on a set of classical benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Cell deformability is a well-established marker of cell states for diagnostic purposes. However, the measurement of a wide range of different deformability levels is still challenging, especially in cancer, where a large heterogeneity of rheological/mechanical properties is present. Therefore, a simple, versatile and cost-effective recognition method for variable rheological/mechanical properties of cells is needed. Here, we introduce a new set of in-flow motion parameters capable of identifying heterogeneity among cell deformability, properly modified by the administration of drugs for cytoskeleton destabilization. Firstly, we measured cell deformability by identification of in-flow motions, rolling (R), tumbling (T), swinging (S) and tank-treading (TT), distinctively associated with cell rheological/mechanical properties. Secondly, from a pool of motion and structural cell parameters, an unsupervised machine learning approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) revealed dominant features: the local cell velocity ( / ), the equilibrium position ( ) and the orientation angle variation (Δ ). These motion parameters clearly defined cell clusters in terms of motion regimes corresponding to specific deformability. Such correlation is verified in a wide range of rheological/mechanical properties from the elastic cells moving like R until the almost viscous cells moving as TT. Thus, our approach shows how simple motion parameters allow cell deformability heterogeneity recognition, directly measuring rheological/mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subset, machine learning, have tremendous potential to transform health care, medicine, and population health through improved diagnoses, treatments, and patient care. However, the effectiveness of these technologies hinges on the quality and diversity of the data used to train them. Many datasets currently used in machine learning are inherently biased and lack diversity, leading to inaccurate predictions that may perpetuate existing health disparities. This commentary highlights the challenges of biased datasets, the impact on marginalized communities, and the critical need for strategies to address these disparities throughout the research continuum. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to adopt more inclusive data collection practices, engage collaboratively with community stakeholders, and leverage innovative approaches like federated learning. These steps can help mitigate bias and enhance the accuracy and fairness of AI-assisted or informed health care solutions. By addressing systemic biases embedded across research phases, we can build a better foundation for AI to enhance diagnostic and treatment capabilities and move society closer to the goal where improved health and health care can be a fundamental right for all, and not just for some.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning collaborates with multiple clients to train a global model, enhancing the model generalization while allowing the local data transmission-free and security. However, federated learning currently faces three intractable challenges: (1) The large number of model parameters result in an excessive communication burden. (2) The non-independently and identically distributed local data induces the degradation of global model. (3) The model heterogeneity renders traditional federated aggregation infeasible. To dissipate the three difficulties, we propose to learn the global prompt in the low-rank tensor space (FedGPT) for heterogeneous federated learning. Specifically, we employ the prompts rather than the model parameters as the carrier of local knowledge to achieve the information interaction between multiple clients. Since the prompts only have a very small number of variables, the communication volume is greatly reduced. To cope with the data heterogeneity, the prompts from different clients are stacked into the third-order tensors, on which the tensor singular value decomposition is performed to extract the global information. Furthermore, the proposed FedGPT possesses the ability to handle the model heterogeneity, the local models of different sizes can transfer the knowledge with the help of the prompts to improve the performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted. Overall, FedGPT outperforms other state-of-the-art compared methods by up to 13.21%, and achieves less than 3% of communication volume of FedAvg, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed FedGPT.",

In response to this challenge, we have conducted the most extensive computational search to date for electrocatalysts that can facilitate NO reduction reaction, starting with 59 390 candidate bimetallic alloys from the Materials Project and Automatic-Flow databases. Using a joint machine learning- and computation-based screening strategy, we evaluated our candidates based on corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, N selectivity, cost, and the ability to synthesize. We found that only 20 materials will satisfy all criteria in our screening strategy, all of which contain varying amounts of Cu. Our proposed list of candidates is consistent with previous materials investigated in the literature, with the exception of Cu-Co and Cu-Ag based compounds that merit further investigation.",

    "title": "Predicting the pathogenicity of protein coding mutations using Natural Language Processing.",
    "abstract": "DNA-Sequencing of tumor cells has revealed thousands of genetic mutations. However, cancer is caused by only some of them. Identifying mutations that contribute to tumor growth from neutral ones is extremely challenging and is currently carried out manually. This manual annotation is very cumbersome and expensive in terms of time and money. In this study, we introduce a novel method \"NLP-SNPPred\" to read scientific literature and learn the implicit features that cause certain variations to be pathogenic. Precisely, our method ingests the bio-medical literature and produces its vector representation via exploiting state of the art NLP methods like sent2vec, word2vec and tf-idf. These representations are then fed to machine learning predictors to identify the pathogenic versus neutral variations. Our best model (NLPSNPPred) trained on OncoKB and evaluated on several publicly available benchmark datasets, outperformed state of the art function prediction methods. Our results show that NLP can be used effectively in predicting functional impact of protein coding variations with minimal complementary biological features. Moreover, encoding biological knowledge into the right representations, combined with machine learning methods can help in automating manual efforts.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) via deep learning has attracted appealing attention for tackling domain-shift problems caused by distribution discrepancy across different domains. Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field.",

For image classification, convolutional neural networks have reshaped the field, but have been challenging to apply to 3D movement data with its intrinsic multidimensional nonlinear correlations. Deep neural networks afford the opportunity to reduce feature engineering effort, remove model-based approximations that can introduce systematic errors, and reduce the manual data processing burden which is often a bottleneck in biomechanical data acquisition. What classification techniques are most appropriate for biomechanical movement data? Baseline performance for 3D joint centre trajectory classification using a number of traditional machine learning techniques are presented. Our framework and dataset support a robust comparison between classifier architectures over 416 athletes (professional, college, and amateur) from five primary and six non-primary sports performing thirteen non-sport-specific movements.

    "title": "A Federated Learning Latency Minimization Method for UAV Swarms Aided by Communication Compression and Energy Allocation.",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle swarms (UAVSs) can carry out numerous tasks such as detection and mapping when outfitted with machine learning (ML) models. However, due to the flying height and mobility of UAVs, it is very difficult to ensure a continuous and stable connection between ground base stations and UAVs, as a result of which distributed machine learning approaches, such as federated learning (FL), perform better than centralized machine learning approaches in some circumstances when utilized by UAVs. However, in practice, functions that UAVs must perform often, such as emergency obstacle avoidance, require a high sensitivity to latency. This work attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption and latency sensitivity of FL in UAVs and present a set of solutions based on an efficient asynchronous federated learning mechanism for edge network computing (EAFLM) combined with ant colony optimization (ACO) for the cases where UAVs execute such latency-sensitive jobs. Specifically, UAVs participating in each round of communication are screened, and only the UAVs that meet the conditions will participate in the regular round of communication so as to compress the communication times. At the same time, the transmit power and CPU frequency of the UAV are adjusted to obtain the shortest time of an individual iteration round. This method is verified using the MNIST dataset and numerical results are provided to support the usefulness of our proposed method. It greatly reduces the communication times between UAVs with a relatively low influence on accuracy and optimizes the allocation of UAVs' communication resources.",

While quantifiable improvements in prediction accuracy have been achieved over theory-driven efforts, models discovered through machine learning continue to fall short of clinical relevance. Thus, the value of machine learning for reaching this objective is hotly contested. We agree that machine learning, treated as a \"black box\" approach antithetical to theory-building, will not discover clinically relevant models of suicide. However, such models may be developed through deliberate synthesis of data- and theory-driven approaches. By providing an accessible overview of essential concepts and common methods, we highlight how generalizable models and scientific insight may be obtained by incorporating prior knowledge and expectations to machine learning research, drawing examples from suicidology. We then discuss challenges investigators will face when using machine learning to discover models of low prevalence outcomes, such as suicide.",

    "abstract": "The protein structure prediction problem has been solved for many types of proteins by AlphaFold. Recently, there has been considerable excitement to build off the success of AlphaFold and predict the 3D structures of RNAs. RNA prediction methods use a variety of techniques, from physics-based to machine learning approaches. We believe that there are challenges preventing the successful development of deep learning-based methods like AlphaFold for RNA in the short term. Broadly speaking, the challenges are the limited number of structures and alignments making data-hungry deep learning methods unlikely to succeed. Additionally, there are several issues with the existing structure and sequence data, as they are often of insufficient quality, highly biased and missing key information. Here, we discuss these challenges in detail and suggest some steps to remedy the situation. We believe that it is possible to create an accurate RNA structure prediction method, but it will require solving several data quality and volume issues, usage of data beyond simple sequence alignments, or the development of new less data-hungry machine learning methods.",

This task requires a nuanced application of language across many activities, including managing clinical requests, analyzing imaging findings in the context of clinical data, interpreting these through the radiologist's lens, and effectively documenting and communicating the outcomes. Radiology practices must ensure reliable communication among numerous systems and stakeholders critical for medical decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to improve the management and interpretation of the vast amounts of text data in radiology. Despite being developed as general-purpose tools, these advanced computational models demonstrate impressive capabilities in specialized tasks, even without specific training. Unlocking the potential of LLMs for radiology requires an understanding of their foundations and a strategic approach to navigate their idiosyncrasies. This review, drawing from practical radiology and machine learning expertise, provides general and technically adept radiologists insight into the potential of LLMs in radiology. It also equips those interested in implementing applicable best practices that have so far stood the test of time in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs. The review provides practical advice for optimizing LLM characteristics for radiology practices, including advice on limitations, effective prompting, and fine-tuning strategies.",

Workflow planning is one of the most common and important problems of this kind, as sub-optimal decision-making may create bottlenecks and delays that decrease efficiency and increase costs.

This makes them hard to implement and impossible to trust, significantly limiting their practical use. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: using machine learning to generate optimal, comprehensible strategies which can be understood and used by humans directly. Through three common decision-making problems found in scheduling, we demonstrate the implementation and feasibility of this approach, as well as its great potential to attain near-optimal results.",

Predictive algorithms belonging to bivariate statistics and machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied for fulfilling the data mining and generating the models. Results show that 60% of the wetland areas are covered by moderate to very high WHV, out of which > 300 km belong to very high WHV followed by a high vulnerability in almost 150 km . This areal coverage increases by 10-15% from phase II to phase III. On the other hand, a relatively safe situation is confined to < 200 km . The receiver operating characteristic curve, root-mean-square error, and correlation coefficient are used to assess the accuracy of these models and categorization of habitat vulnerability. Ensemble modeling is done using the individual models having a greater accuracy level in order to increase accuracy. A field-based model of the same is prepared by gathering information directly from the field which also exhibits similar results with the algorithm-based models. Analysis of residuals in standard regression strongly supports the relevance of the selected parameters and multi-parametric models.",

Towards addressing systems' vulnerabilities and alleviating the impact of these threats, this paper presents a machine learning based situational awareness framework that detects existing and newly introduced network-enabled entities, utilizing the real-time awareness feature provided by the SDN paradigm, assesses them against known vulnerabilities, and assigns them to a connectivity-appropriate network slice. The assessed entities are continuously monitored by an ML-based IDS, which is trained with an enhanced dataset. Our endeavor aims to demonstrate that a neural network, trained with heterogeneous data stemming from the operational environment (common vulnerability enumeration IDs that correlate attacks with existing vulnerabilities), can achieve more accurate prediction rates than a conventional one, thus addressing some aspects of the situational awareness paradigm. The proposed framework was evaluated within a real-life environment and the results revealed an increase of more than 4% in the overall prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of machine learning tools, it is challenging to properly model cause-specific deaths in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and choose appropriate treatments. Here, we propose an interesting feature selection framework, namely union with recursive feature elimination (U-RFE), to select the union feature sets that are crucial in CRC progression-specific mortality using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Based on the union feature sets, we compared the performance of 5 classification algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and Stacking, to identify the best model for classifying 4-category deaths. In the first stage of U-RFE, LR, SVM, and RF were used as base estimators to obtain subsets containing the same number of features but not exactly the same specific features. Union analysis of the subsets was then performed to determine the final union feature set, effectively combining the advantages of different algorithms. We found that the U-RFE framework could improve various models' performance. Stacking outperformed LR, SVM, RF, and XGBoost in most scenarios. When the target feature number of the RFE was set to 50 and the union feature set contained 298 deterministic features, the Stacking model achieved F1_weighted, Recall_weighted, Precision_weighted, Accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.851, 0.864, 0.854, 0.864, and 0.717, respectively. The performance of the minority categories was also significantly improved. Therefore, this recursive feature elimination-based approach of feature selection improves performances of classifying CRC deaths using clinical and omics data or those using other data with high feature redundancy and imbalance.",

After the training of the RF model using the data of polymer brush films synthesized from five different types of monomers, the model became capable of predicting the amount of adsorbed protein from the chemical structure, physicochemical properties of monomer molecules, and structural parameters (density and thickness of the films). The analysis of the trained RF quantitatively provided the importance of each structural parameter and physicochemical properties of monomers toward serum protein adsorption (SPA).

In previous years, most of the traditional molecular representations are based on hand-crafted features and rely heavily on biological experimentations, which are often costly and time consuming. However, recent researches achieve promising results using machine learning on various domains. In this article, we present a novel method named Smi2Vec-BiGRU that is designed for learning atoms and solving the single- and multitask binary classification problems in the field of drug discovery, which are the basic and also key problems in this field. Specifically, our approach transforms the molecule data in the SMILES format into a set of sample vectors and then feeds them into the bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural networks for training, which learns low-dimensional vector representations for molecular drug. We conduct extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks including Tox21, SIDER and ClinTox. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarking datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and competitiveness of our proposed approach.",

    "title": "Population pharmacokinetic model selection assisted by machine learning.",
    "abstract": "A fit-for-purpose structural and statistical model is the first major requirement in population pharmacometric model development. In this manuscript we discuss how this complex and computationally intensive task could benefit from supervised machine learning algorithms. We compared the classical pharmacometric approach with two machine learning methods, genetic algorithm and neural networks, in different scenarios based on simulated pharmacokinetic data. Genetic algorithm performance was assessed using a fitness function based on log-likelihood, whilst neural networks were trained using mean square error or binary cross-entropy loss. Machine learning provided a selection based only on statistical rules and achieved accurate selection. The minimization process of genetic algorithm was successful at allowing the algorithm to select plausible models. Neural network classification tasks achieved the most accurate results. Neural network regression tasks were less precise than neural network classification and genetic algorithm methods. The computational gain obtained by using machine learning was substantial, especially in the case of neural networks. We demonstrated that machine learning methods can greatly increase the efficiency of pharmacokinetic population model selection in case of large datasets or complex models requiring long run-times. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches can achieve a first fast selection of models which can be followed by more conventional pharmacometric approaches.",

    "title": "Single dendritic neural classification with an effective spherical search-based whale learning algorithm.",
    "abstract": "McCulloch-Pitts neuron-based neural networks have been the mainstream deep learning methods, achieving breakthrough in various real-world applications. However, McCulloch-Pitts neuron is also under longtime criticism of being overly simplistic. To alleviate this issue, the dendritic neuron model (DNM), which employs non-linear information processing capabilities of dendrites, has been widely used for prediction and classification tasks. In this study, we innovatively propose a hybrid approach to co-evolve DNM in contrast to back propagation (BP) techniques, which are sensitive to initial circumstances and readily fall into local minima. The whale optimization algorithm is improved by spherical search learning to perform co-evolution through dynamic hybridizing. Eleven classification datasets were selected from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. Its efficiency in our model was verified by statistical analysis of convergence speed and Wilcoxon sign-rank tests, with receiver operating characteristic curves and the calculation of area under the curve. In terms of classification accuracy, the proposed co-evolution method beats 10 existing cutting-edge non-BP methods and BP, suggesting that well-learned DNMs are computationally significantly more potent than conventional McCulloch-Pitts types and can be employed as the building blocks for the next-generation deep learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Progress in the application of machine learning (ML) methods to materials design is hindered by the lack of understanding of the reliability of ML predictions, in particular, for the application of ML to small data sets often found in materials science. Using ML prediction for transparent conductor oxide formation energy and band gap, dilute solute diffusion, and perovskite formation energy, band gap, and lattice parameter as examples, we demonstrate that (1) construction of a convex hull in feature space that encloses accurately predicted systems can be used to identify regions in feature space for which ML predictions are highly reliable; (2) analysis of the systems enclosed by the convex hull can be used to extract physical understanding; and (3) materials that satisfy all well-known chemical and physical principles that make a material physically reasonable are likely to be similar and show strong relationships between the properties of interest and the standard features used in ML. We also show that similar to the composition-structure-property relationships, inclusion in the ML training data set of materials from classes with different chemical properties will not be beneficial for the accuracy of ML prediction and that reliable results likely will be obtained by ML model for narrow classes of similar materials even in the case where the ML model will show large errors on the data set consisting of several classes of materials.",

Here we demonstrate how collaborative filtering, denoising autoencoders, and variational autoencoders can impute missing values in the context of LFQ at different levels. We applied our method, proteomics imputation modeling mass spectrometry (PIMMS), to an alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) cohort with blood plasma proteomics data available for 358 individuals. Removing 20 percent of the intensities we were able to recover 15 out of 17 significant abundant protein groups using PIMMS-VAE imputations. When analyzing the full dataset we identified 30 additional proteins (+13.2%) that were significantly differentially abundant across disease stages compared to no imputation and found that some of these were predictive of ALD progression in machine learning models. We, therefore, suggest the use of deep learning approaches for imputing missing values in MS-based proteomics on larger datasets and provide workflows for these.",

Image-based noninvasive methods are used for early detection and for providing appropriate treatment. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) schemes can support radiologists in making correct decisions. Computational intelligence paradigms such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have been used in the recent past in CAD systems to accelerate diagnosis. ML techniques are feature driven and require a high amount of domain expertise. However, DL approaches make decisions directly from the image. The current advancement in DL approaches for early diagnosis of BC is the motivation behind this review. This article throws light on various types of CAD approaches used in BC detection and diagnosis. A survey on DL, Transfer Learning, and DL-based CAD approaches for the diagnosis of BC is presented in detail. A comparative study on techniques, datasets, and performance metrics used in state-of-the-art literature in BC diagnosis is also summarized.

MRGCNs have been shown to yield results superior than traditional GCNs in various machine learning tasks. The key idea is to introduce a new kind of convolution operated on tensors that can effectively exploit correlations exhibited in multiple relationships. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the algorithmic stability and generalization guarantees of MRGCNs to confirm the usefulness of MRGCNs. Our contributions are of three folds. First, we develop a matrix representation of various tensor operations underneath MRGCNs to simplify the analysis significantly. Next, we prove the uniform stability of MRGCNs and deduce the convergence of the generalization gap to support the usefulness of MRGCNs. The analysis sheds lights on the design of MRGCNs, for instance, how the data should be scaled to achieve the uniform stability of the learning process. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate the stability results.",

    "abstract": "Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used and economical tests to diagnose a wide range of diseases. However, even for expert radiologists, it is a challenge to accurately diagnose diseases from CXR samples. Furthermore, there remains an acute shortage of trained radiologists worldwide. In the present study, a range of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL) approaches have been evaluated to classify diseases in an openly available CXR image dataset. A combination of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and weighted class balancing is used to alleviate the effects of class imbalance. A hybrid Inception-ResNet-v2 transfer learning model coupled with data augmentation and image enhancement gives the best accuracy. The model is deployed in an edge environment using Amazon IoT Core to automate the task of disease detection in CXR images with three categories, namely pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal. Comparative analysis has been given in various metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, AUC-ROC score, etc. The proposed technique gives an average accuracy of 98.66%. The accuracies of other TL models, namely SqueezeNet, VGG19, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 are 97.33%, 91.66%, 90.33%, and 76.00%, respectively. Further, a DL model, trained from scratch, gives an accuracy of 92.43%. Two feature-based ML classification techniques, namely support vector machine with local binary pattern (SVM + LBP) and decision tree with histogram of oriented gradients (DT + HOG) yield an accuracy of 87.98% and 86.87%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Natural compounds constitute a rich resource of potential small molecule therapeutics. While experimental access to this resource is limited due to its vast diversity and difficulties in systematic purification, computational assessment of structural similarity with known therapeutic molecules offers a scalable approach. Here, we assessed functional similarity between natural compounds and approved drugs by combining multiple chemical similarity metrics and physicochemical properties using a machine-learning approach. We computed pairwise similarities between 1410 drugs for training classification models and used the drugs shared protein targets as class labels. The best performing models were random forest which gave an average area under the ROC of 0.9, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.35, and F1 score of 0.33, suggesting that it captured the structure-activity relation well. The models were then used to predict protein targets of circa 11k natural compounds by comparing them with the drugs. This revealed therapeutic potential of several natural compounds, including those with support from previously published sources as well as those hitherto unexplored. We experimentally validated one of the predicted pair's activities, viz., Cox-1 inhibition by 5-methoxysalicylic acid, a molecule commonly found in tea, herbs and spices. In contrast, another natural compound, 4-isopropylbenzoic acid, with the highest similarity score when considering most weighted similarity metric but not picked by our models, did not inhibit Cox-1. Our results demonstrate the utility of a machine-learning approach combining multiple chemical features for uncovering protein binding potential of natural compounds.",

Among the different devices, the conical nanopores obtained by the track-etched technique on a polymer film are stable and easy to functionalize. However, these advantages are hampered by their high aspect ratio that avoids the discrimination of similar samples. Using machine learning, we demonstrate an improved resolution so that it can identify short single- and double-stranded DNA (10- and 40-mers). We have characterized each current blockade event by the relative intensity, dwell time, surface area and both the right and left slope. We show an overlap of the relative current blockade amplitudes and dwell time distributions that prevents their identification. We define the different parameters that characterize the events as features and the type of DNA sample as the target. By applying support-vector machines to discriminate each sample, we show accuracy between 50% and 72% by using two features that distinctly classify the data points. Finally, we achieved an increased accuracy (up to 82%) when five features were implemented.",

    "abstract": "Iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) pose significant health concerns due to their high toxicity. Current approaches to recognize unknown I-DBPs in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis rely on negative ionization mode, in which the characteristic I fragment can be observed in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). Still, many I-DBPs ionize exclusively in positive ionization mode, where the I fragment is absent. To address this gap, this work developed a machine learning-based strategy to recognize iodinated compounds (I-compounds) from their MS/MS in both electrospray positive (ESI+) and negative ionization (ESI-) modes. Investigating over 6000 MS/MS spectra of 381 I-compounds, we first identified five characteristic I-containing neutral losses and one diagnostic I fragment in ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. We then trained Random Forest models and integrated them into IodoFinder, a Python program, to streamline the recognition of I-compounds from raw LC-MS data. IodoFinder accurately recognized over 96% of the 161 I-compound standards in both ionization modes. In its application to DBP mixtures, IodoFinder discovered 19 I-DBPs with annotated structures and an additional 17 with assigned formulas, including 12 novel and 3 confirmed I-DBPs. We envision that IodoFinder will advance the identification of both known and unknown I-compounds in exposome studies.",

The use of algorithms for property prediction can reduce the extensive experimental work, saving time and costs. To assess this, ternary poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)-based bionanocomposites reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) and montmorillonite nanoclay were prepared herein via an environmentally friendly electrochemical process followed by solution casting. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different Machine Learning (ML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), in predicting their mechanical properties. The algorithms' input data were the Young's modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break for various concentrations of the nanofillers (GO and nanoclay). The correlation coefficient ( ), mean absolute error ( ), and mean square error ( ) were used as statistical indicators to assess the performance of the models. The results demonstrated that ANN and SVM are useful for estimating the Young's modulus and elongation at break, with values in the range of 0.64-1.0% and 0.14-0.28%, respectively. On the other hand, DT was more suitable for predicting the tensile strength, with the indicated error in the range of 0.02-9.11%. This study paves the way for the application of ML models as confident tools for predicting the mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites reinforced with different types of nanofiller, with a view to using them in practical applications such as biomedicine.",

Both classifiers employ salient features to determine the probability of curation-eligible publications, which can effectively reduce the workload of manual triage and curation process.

AlexNet provides comparable results, reaching 89.28% on spectrograms and 83.43% on MFCC.The Naïve Bayes classifier provides a 87.09% accuracy and a 0.985 average AUC while being faster to train and more interpretable. Feature selection shows how F0, MFCC and voicing-related features are the most characterizing for this SR task. The high amount of training samples and the emotional content of the DEMoS dataset better reflect a real case scenario for speaker recognition, and account for the generalization power of the models.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing large Language models (LLMs) for handling scientific information comes with risk of the outputs not matching expectations, commonly called hallucinations. To fully utilize LLMs in research requires improving their accuracy, avoiding hallucinations, and extending their scope to research topics outside their direct training. There is also a benefit to getting the most accurate information from an LLM at the time of inference without having to create and train custom new models for each application. Here, augmented generation and machine learning-driven prompt optimization are combined to extract performance improvements over base LLM function on a common chemical research task. Specifically, an LLM was used to predict the topological polar surface area (TPSA) of molecules. By using augmented generation and machine learning-optimized prompts, the error in the prediction was reduced to 11.76 root-mean-squared error (RMSE) from 62.34 RMSE with direct calls to the same LLM.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, human age estimation from face images attracted the attention of many researchers in computer vision and machine learning fields. This is due to its numerous applications. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for age estimation based on facial images. It is mainly based on a cascade of classification trees ensembles, which are known recently as a Deep Random Forest. Our architecture is composed of two types of DRF. The first type extends and enhances the feature representation of a given facial descriptor. The second type operates on the fused form of all enhanced representations in order to provide a prediction for the age while taking into account the fuzziness property of the human age. While the proposed methodology is able to work with all kinds of image features, the face descriptors adopted in this work used off-the-shelf deep features allowing to retain both the rich deep features and the powerful enhancement and decision provided by the proposed architecture. Experiments conducted on six public databases prove the superiority of the proposed architecture over other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Pipelines are integral components for storing and transporting liquid and gaseous petroleum products. Despite being durable structures, ruptures can still occur, resulting not only in financial losses and energy waste but, most importantly, in immeasurable environmental disasters and possibly in human casualties. The objective of the ESTHISIS project is the development of a low-cost and efficient wireless sensor system for the instantaneous detection of leaks in metallic pipeline networks transporting liquid and gaseous petroleum products in a noisy industrial environment. The implemented methodology is based on processing the spectrum of vibration signals appearing in the pipeline walls due to a leakage effect and aims to minimize interference in the piping system. It is intended to use low frequencies to detect and characterize leakage to increase the range of sensors and thus reduce cost. In the current work, the smart sensor system developed for signal acquisition and data analysis is briefly described. For this matter, two leakage detection methodologies are implemented. A 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model undertakes supervised classification in spectrograms extracted by the signals acquired by the accelerometers mounted on the pipeline wall. This approach allows us to supplant large-signal datasets with a more memory-efficient alternative to storing static images. Second, Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders (LSTM AE) are employed, receiving signals from the accelerometers, and providing an unsupervised leakage detection solution.",

    "abstract": "In considering the need of people all over the world for high-quality food, there has been a recent increase in interest in the role of nondestructive and rapid detection technologies in the food industry. Moreover, the analysis of data acquired by most nondestructive technologies is complex, time-consuming, and requires highly skilled operators. Meanwhile, the general applicability of various chemometric or statistical methods is affected by noise, sample, variability, and data complexity that vary under various testing conditions. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) techniques have a wide range of applications in the food industry, especially in nondestructive technology and equipment intelligence, due to their powerful ability in handling irrelevant information, extracting feature variables, and building calibration models. The review provides an introduction and comparison of machine learning techniques, and summarizes these algorithms as traditional machine learning (TML), and deep learning (DL). Moreover, several novel nondestructive technologies, namely acoustic analysis, machine vision (MV), electronic nose (E-nose), and spectral imaging, combined with different advanced ML techniques and their applications in food quality assessment such as variety identification and classification, safety inspection and processing control, are presented. In addition to this, the existing challenges and prospects are discussed. The result of this review indicates that nondestructive testing technologies combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques show great potential for monitoring the quality and safety of food products and different machine learning algorithms have their characteristics and applicability scenarios. Due to the nature of feature learning, DL is one of the most promising and powerful techniques for real-time applications, which needs further research for full and wide applications in the food industry.",

At present, reviewers need to manually identify relevant parts of research articles for a set of methodological elements that affect the risk of bias, in order to make a risk-of-bias judgement for each of these elements. We investigate the use of text mining methods to automate risk-of-bias assessments in systematic reviews. We aim to identify relevant sentences within the text of included articles, to rank articles by risk of bias and to reduce the number of risk-of-bias assessments that the reviewers need to perform by hand. We use supervised machine learning to train two types of models, for each of the three risk-of-bias properties of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. The first model predicts whether a sentence in a research article contains relevant information. The second model predicts a risk-of-bias value for each research article. We use logistic regression, where each independent variable is the frequency of a word in a sentence or article, respectively. We found that sentences can be successfully ranked by relevance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) > 0.98. Articles can be ranked by risk of bias with AUC > 0.72. We estimate that more than 33% of articles can be assessed by just one reviewer, where two reviewers are normally required. We show that text mining can be used to assist risk-of-bias assessments.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an upcoming machine learning paradigm which allows data from multiple sources to be used for training of classifiers without the data leaving the source it originally resides. This can be highly valuable for use cases such as medical research, where gathering data at a central location can be quite complicated due to privacy and legal concerns of the data. In such cases, federated learning has the potential to vastly speed up the research cycle. Although federated and central learning have been compared from a theoretical perspective, an extensive experimental comparison of performances and learning behavior still lacks. We have performed a comprehensive experimental comparison between federated and centralized learning. We evaluated various classifiers on various datasets exploring influences of different sample distributions as well as different class distributions across the clients. The results show similar performances under a wide variety of settings between the federated and central learning strategies. Federated learning is able to deal with various imbalances in the data distributions. It is sensitive to batch effects between different datasets when they coincide with location, similar to central learning, but this setting might go unobserved more easily. Federated learning seems to be robust to various challenges such as skewed data distributions, high data dimensionality, multiclass problems, and complex models. Taken together, the insights from our comparison gives much promise for applying federated learning as an alternative to sharing data.

    "abstract": "Due to connectivity and automation trends, the medical device industry is experiencing increased demand for safety and security mechanisms. Anomaly detection has proven to be a valuable approach for ensuring safety and security in other industries, such as automotive or IT. Medical devices must operate across a wide range of values due to variations in patient anthropometric data, making anomaly detection based on a simple threshold for signal deviations impractical. For example, surgical robots directly contacting the patient's tissue require precise sensor data. However, since the deformation of the patient's body during interaction or movement is highly dependent on body mass, it is impossible to define a single threshold for implausible sensor data that applies to all patients. This also involves statistical methods, such as Z-score, that consider standard deviation. Even pure machine learning algorithms cannot be expected to provide the required accuracy simply due to the lack of available training data. This paper proposes using hybrid filters by combining dynamic system models based on expert knowledge and data-based models for anomaly detection in an operating room scenario. This approach can improve detection performance and explainability while reducing the computing resources needed on embedded devices, enabling a distributed approach to anomaly detection.",

However, various approaches have been developed to tackle the obstacles this problem creates. Properly managing the size of blocks in a file system is essential as it saves memory and computing time and may reduce bottlenecks. In this article, a new approach using a Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm is suggested for dealing with small files. The proposed method identifies the files by their structure and via a special Dendrogram analysis, and then recommends which files can be merged. As a simulation, the proposed algorithm was applied via 100 CSV files with different structures, containing 2-4 columns with different data types (integer, decimal and text). Also, 20 files that were not CSV files were created to demonstrate that the algorithm only works on CSV files. All data were analyzed via a machine learning hierarchical clustering method, and a Dendrogram was created. According to the merge process that was performed, seven files from the Dendrogram analysis were chosen as appropriate files to be merged. This reduced the memory space in the HDFS. Furthermore, the results showed that using the suggested algorithm led to efficient file management.",

A total of 57 Polish participants, including PD patients and healthy controls, performed five speech tasks while using an MR head-mounted display (HMD). Speech data were recorded and analyzed to extract acoustic and linguistic features, which were then evaluated using machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.90 ± 0.05 in the story-retelling task. Key features such as MFCCs (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), spectral characteristics, RASTA-filtered auditory spectrum, and local shimmer were identified as significant in detecting PD-related speech alterations. Additionally, state-of-the-art deep learning models (wav2vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) were fine-tuned for PD detection. HuBERT achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score of 0.94 ± 0.04 in the diadochokinetic task, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to capture complex speech patterns linked to neurodegenerative diseases. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining MR technology for speech data collection with advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, offering a non-invasive and high-precision approach to PD diagnosis.

    "title": "Ensemble machine learning model trained on a new synthesized dataset generalizes well for stress prediction using wearable devices.",
    "abstract": "Advances in wearable sensor technology have enabled the collection of biomarkers that may correlate with levels of elevated stress. While significant research has been done in this domain, specifically in using machine learning to detect elevated levels of stress, the challenge of producing a machine learning model capable of generalizing well for use on new, unseen data remain. Acute stress response has both subjective, psychological and objectively measurable, biological components that can be expressed differently from person to person, further complicating the development of a generic stress measurement model. Another challenge is the lack of large, publicly available datasets labeled for stress response that can be used to develop robust machine learning models. In this paper, we first investigate the generalization ability of models built on datasets containing a small number of subjects, recorded in single study protocols. Next, we propose and evaluate methods combining these datasets into a single, large dataset to study the generalization capability of machine learning models built on larger datasets. Finally, we propose and evaluate the use of ensemble techniques by combining gradient boosting with an artificial neural network to measure predictive power on new, unseen data. In favor of reproducible research and to assist the community advance the field, we make all our experimental data and code publicly available through Github at https://github.com/xalentis/Stress. This paper's in-depth study of machine learning model generalization for stress detection provides an important foundation for the further study of stress response measurement using sensor biomarkers, recorded with wearable technologies. Sensor biomarker data from six public datasets were utilized in this study. Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the physiological variance between study subjects, and the complexity it introduces in building machine learning models capable of detecting elevated levels of stress on new, unseen data. To test model generalization, we developed a gradient boosting model trained on one dataset (SWELL), and tested its predictive power on two datasets previously used in other studies (WESAD, NEURO). Next, we merged four small datasets, i.e. (SWELL, NEURO, WESAD, UBFC-Phys), to provide a combined total of 99 subjects, and applied feature engineering to generate additional features utilizing statistical summaries, with sliding windows of 25 s. We name this large dataset, StressData. In addition, we utilized random sampling on StressData combined with another dataset (EXAM) to build a larger training dataset consisting of 200 synthesized subjects, which we name SynthesizedStressData. Finally, we developed an ensemble model that combines our gradient boosting model with an artificial neural network, and tested it using Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) validation, and on two additional, unseen publicly available stress biomarker datasets (WESAD and Toadstool). Our results show that previous models built on datasets containing a small number (<50) of subjects, recorded in single study protocols, cannot generalize well to new, unseen datasets. Our presented methodology for generating a large, synthesized training dataset by utilizing random sampling to construct scenarios closely aligned with experimental conditions demonstrate significant benefits. When combined with feature-engineering and ensemble learning, our method delivers a robust stress measurement system capable of achieving 85% predictive accuracy on new, unseen validation data, achieving a 25% performance improvement over single models trained on small datasets. The resulting model can be used as both a classification or regression predictor for estimating the level of perceived stress, when applied on specific sensor biomarkers recorded using a wearable device, while further allowing researchers to construct large, varied datasets for training machine learning models that closely emulate their exact experimental conditions. Models trained on small, single study protocol datasets do not generalize well for use on new, unseen data and lack statistical power. Machine learning models trained on a dataset containing a larger number of varied study subjects capture physiological variance better, resulting in more robust stress detection. Feature-engineering assists in capturing these physiological variance, and this is further improved by utilizing ensemble techniques by combining the predictive power of different machine learning models, each capable of learning unique signals contained within the data. While there is a general lack of large, labeled public datasets that can be utilized for training machine learning models capable of accurately measuring levels of acute stress, random sampling techniques can successfully be applied to construct larger, varied datasets from these smaller sample datasets, for building robust machine learning models.",

Our empirical findings demonstrate that TooT-BERT-CNN-C, which combines features from ProtBERT-BFD and a CNN, substantially surpasses existing benchmarks. On our original dataset, it achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.8584 and an accuracy of 98.35 %. More impressively, on a newly curated, larger dataset (DS-Cv2), it attains an MCC of 0.9492 and an ROC AUC of 0.9968 on the independent test set. These results not only highlight the power of integrating protein language models with deep learning for ion channel classification but also underscore the importance of using up-to-date, comprehensive datasets in bioinformatics tasks. Our approach represents a significant advancement in computational methods for ion channel identification, with potential implications for accelerating research in ion channel biology and aiding drug discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "Modern medical diagnosis, treatment, or rehabilitation problems of the patient reach completely different levels due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence tools. Methods of machine learning and optimization based on the intersection of historical data of various volumes provide significant support to physicians in the form of accurate and fast solutions of automated diagnostic systems. It significantly improves the quality of medical services. This special issue deals with the problems of medical diagnosis and prognosis in the case of short datasets. The problem is not new, but existing machine learning methods do not always demonstrate the adequacy of prediction or classification models, especially in the case of limited data to implement the training procedures. That is why the improvement of existing and development of new artificial intelligence tools that will be able to solve it effectively is an urgent task. The special issue contains the latest achievements in medical diagnostics based on the processing of small numerical and image-based datasets. Described methods have a strong theoretical basis, and numerous experimental studies confirm the high efficiency of their application in various applied fields of Medicine.",

    "title": "The Necessity of Multiple Data Sources for ECG-Based Machine Learning Models.",
    "abstract": "Even though the interest in machine learning studies is growing significantly, especially in medicine, the imbalance between study results and clinical relevance is more pronounced than ever. The reasons for this include data quality and interoperability issues. Hence, we aimed at examining site- and study-specific differences in publicly available standard electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets, which in theory should be interoperable by consistent 12-lead definition, sampling rate, and measurement duration. The focus lies upon the question of whether even slight study peculiarities can affect the stability of trained machine learning models. To this end, the performances of modern network architectures as well as unsupervised pattern detection algorithms are investigated across different datasets. Overall, this is intended to examine the generalization of machine learning results of single-site ECG studies.",
