    "title": "In-Vehicle Communication Cyber Security: Challenges and Solutions.",
    "abstract": "In-vehicle communication has become an integral part of today's driving environment considering the growing add-ons of sensor-centric communication and computing devices inside a vehicle for a range of purposes including vehicle monitoring, physical wiring reduction, and driving efficiency. However, related literature on cyber security for in-vehicle communication systems is still lacking potential dedicated solutions for in-vehicle cyber risks. Existing solutions are mainly relying on protocol-specific security techniques and lacking an overall security framework for in-vehicle communication. In this context, this paper critically explores the literature on cyber security for in-vehicle communication focusing on technical architecture, methodologies, challenges, and possible solutions. In-vehicle communication network architecture is presented considering key components, interfaces, and related technologies. The protocols for in-vehicle communication have been classified based on their characteristics, and usage type. Security solutions for in-vehicle communication have been critically reviewed considering machine learning, cryptography, and port-centric techniques. A multi-layer secure framework is also developed as a protocol and use case-independent in-vehicle communication solution. Finally, open challenges and future dimensions of research for in-vehicle communication cyber security are highlighted as observations and recommendations.",

    "title": "Hybrid Technique for Cyber-Physical Security in Cloud-Based Smart Industries.",
    "abstract": "New technologies and trends in industries have opened up ways for distributed establishment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) for smart industries. CPSs are largely based upon Internet of Things (IoT) because of data storage on cloud servers which poses many constraints due to the heterogeneous nature of devices involved in communication. Among other challenges, security is the most daunting challenge that contributes, at least in part, to the impeded momentum of the CPS realization. Designers assume that CPSs are themselves protected as they cannot be accessed from external networks. However, these days, CPSs have combined parts of the cyber world and also the physical layer. Therefore, cyber security problems are large for commercial CPSs because the systems move with one another and conjointly with physical surroundings, i.e., Complex Industrial Applications (CIA). Therefore, in this paper, a novel data security algorithm Dynamic Hybrid Secured Encryption Technique (DHSE) is proposed based on the hybrid encryption scheme of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). The proposed algorithm divides the data into three categories, i.e., less sensitive, mid-sensitive and high sensitive. The data is distributed by forming the named-data packets (NDPs) via labelling the names. One can choose the number of rounds depending on the actual size of a key; it is necessary to perform a minimum of 10 rounds for 128-bit keys in DHSE. The average encryption time taken by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), IBE (Identity-based encryption) and ABE (Attribute-Based Encryption) is 3.25 ms, 2.18 ms and 2.39 ms, respectively. Whereas the average time taken by the DHSE encryption algorithm is 2.07 ms which is very much less when compared to other algorithms. Similarly, the average decryption times taken by AES, IBE and ABE are 1.77 ms, 1.09 ms and 1.20 ms and the average times taken by the DHSE decryption algorithms are 1.07 ms, which is very much less when compared to other algorithms. The analysis shows that the framework is well designed and provides confidentiality of data with minimum encryption and decryption time. Therefore, the proposed approach is well suited for CPS-IoT.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity in healthcare: A systematic review of modern threats and trends.",
    "abstract": "The adoption of healthcare technology is arduous, and it requires planning and implementation time. Healthcare organizations are vulnerable to modern trends and threats because it has not kept up with threats. The objective of this systematic review is to identify cybersecurity trends, including ransomware, and identify possible solutions by querying academic literature. The reviewers conducted three separate searches through the CINAHL and PubMed (MEDLINE) and the Nursing and Allied Health Source via ProQuest databases. Using key words with Boolean operators, database filters, and hand screening, we identified 31 articles that met the objective of the review. The analysis of 31 articles showed the healthcare industry lags behind in security. Like other industries, healthcare should clearly define cybersecurity duties, establish clear procedures for upgrading software and handling a data breach, use VLANs and deauthentication and cloud-based computing, and to train their users not to open suspicious code. The healthcare industry is a prime target for medical information theft as it lags behind other leading industries in securing vital data. It is imperative that time and funding is invested in maintaining and ensuring the protection of healthcare technology and the confidentially of patient information from unauthorized access.",

    "title": "We need to aim at the top: Factors associated with cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers.",
    "abstract": "Cyberattacks pose a significant business risk to organizations. Although there is ample literature focusing on why people pose a major risk to organizational cybersecurity and how to deal with it, there is surprisingly little we know about cyber and information security decision-makers who are essentially the people in charge of setting up and maintaining organizational cybersecurity. In this paper, we study cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers, and investigate factors associated with it. We conducted an online survey among Slovenian cyber and information security decision-makers (N = 283) to (1) determine whether their cybersecurity awareness is associated with adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations, and (2) explore which organizational factors and personal characteristics are associated with their cybersecurity awareness. Our findings indicate that awareness of well-known threats and solutions seems to be quite low for individuals in decision-making roles. They also provide insights into which threats (e.g., distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, botnets, industrial espionage, and phishing) and solutions (e.g., security operation center (SOC), advanced antimalware solutions with endpoint detection and response (EDR)/extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities, organizational critical infrastructure access control, centralized device management, multi-factor authentication, centralized management of software updates, and remote data deletion on lost or stolen devices) are cyber and information security decision-makers the least aware of. We uncovered that awareness of certain threats and solutions is positively associated with either adoption of advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities or adoption of SOC. Additionally, we identified significant organizational factors (organizational role type) and personal characteristics (gender, age, experience with information security and experience with information technology (IT)) related to cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers. Organization size and formal education were not significant. These results offer insights that can be leveraged in targeted cybersecurity training tailored to the needs of groups of cyber and information security decision-makers based on these key factors.",

    "abstract": "The attitude that 'it won't happen to me' still prevails in the boardrooms of industry when senior executives consider the threat of targeted cyber intrusions. Not much has changed in the commercial world of cyber security over the past few years; hackers are not being challenged to find new ways to steal companies' intellectual property and confidential information. The consequences of even major security breaches seem not to be felt by the leaders of victim companies. Why is this so? Surely IT security practitioners are seeking new ways to detect and prevent targeted intrusions into companies' networks? Are the consequences of targeted intrusions so insignificant that the captains of industry tolerate them? Or do only others feel the pain of their failure? This paper initially explores the failure of cyber security in industry and contends that, while industry leaders should not be alone in accepting responsibility for this failure, they must take the initiative to make life harder for cyber threat actors. They cannot wait for government leadership on policy, strategy or coordination. The paper then suggests some measures that a CEO can adopt to build a new corporate approach to cyber security.",

    "title": "Bayesian Estimation of Oscillator Parameters: Toward Anomaly Detection and Cyber-Physical System Security.",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical system security presents unique challenges to conventional measurement science and technology. Anomaly detection in software-assisted physical systems, such as those employed in additive manufacturing or in DNA synthesis, is often hampered by the limited available parameter space of the underlying mechanism that is transducing the anomaly. As a result, the formulation of anomaly detection for such systems often leads to inverse or ill-posed problems, requiring statistical treatments. Here, we present Bayesian inference of unknown parameters associated with a generic actuator considered as a representative vital element of a cyber-physical system. Via a series of experimental input-output measurements, a transfer function for the actuator is obtained numerically, which serves as our model for the proposed method. Linear, nonlinear, and delayed dynamics may be assumed for the actuator response. By devising a code-based malicious signal, we study the efficacy of Bayesian inference for its potential to produce a detection, including uncertainty quantification, with a remarkably small number of input data points. Our approach should be adaptable to a variety of real-time cyber-physical anomaly detection scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have recently created previously unimaginable opportunities for boosting clinical and patient services, reducing costs and improving community health. Yet, a fundamental challenge that the modern healthcare management system faces is storing and securely transferring data. Therefore, this research proposes a novel Lionized remora optimization-based serpent (LRO-S) encryption method to encrypt sensitive data and reduce privacy breaches and cyber-attacks from unauthorized users and hackers. The LRO-S method is the combination of hybrid metaheuristic optimization and improved security algorithm. The fitness functions of lion and remora are combined to create a new algorithm for security key generation, which is provided to the serpent encryption algorithm. The LRO-S technique encrypts sensitive patient data before storing it in the cloud. The primary goal of this study is to improve the safety and adaptability of medical professionals' access to cloud-based patient-sensitive data more securely. The experiment's findings suggest that the secret keys generated are sufficiently random and one of a kind to provide adequate protection for the data stored in modern healthcare management systems. The proposed method minimizes the time needed to encrypt and decrypt data and improves privacy standards. This study found that the suggested technique outperformed previous techniques in terms of reducing execution time and is cost-effective.",

    "title": "Redefining cyber resilience : Through the risk register lens.",
    "abstract": "Resilience is deeper than maintaining a company's operations and services in the face of significant disruptions. It is the ability of a business to withstand, pivot and continue to grow in the face of a significant threat. To achieve resilience, companies must have an integrated, end-to-end understanding of how a specific threat magnifies the risks identified on their risk register, and what measures are needed across the enterprise to address the amplification of those risks. This paper details how the need for a holistic approach is especially important for cyber crises, compared with other types of crises, because they tend to have more broad-ranging impacts and complexities, such as: unclear timelines, lack of public empathy, unpredictable human threat actor(s), as well as a broader set of internal and external stakeholders that need to be engaged. Unlike other crises, cyber crises have the potential to magnify most - if not all - of the risks on the risk register. As such, cyber resilience requires ensuring that key stakeholders, whether shareholders, customers, regulators, business partners, employees, etc, stay resolute in their faith in a company and its leadership's ability to navigate the increasingly complex issues related to cyber risks and how these issues are addressed enterprise-wide, not purely seen through the lens of technical or operational resilience. To achieve cyber resilience, organisations must develop and implement programmes that integrate both the technical and the broader business measures needed to limit fallout, demonstrate leadership through cyber crises, and deepen trust regardless of the potential severity of the impact.",

    "abstract": "This research study mainly focused on the dynamic malware detection. Malware progressively changes, leading to the use of dynamic malware detection techniques in this research study. Each day brings a new influx of malicious software programmes that pose a threat to online safety by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Internet. The proliferation of harmful software has rendered manual heuristic examination of malware analysis ineffective. Automatic behaviour-based malware detection using machine learning algorithms is thus considered a game-changing innovation. Threats are automatically evaluated based on their behaviours in a simulated environment, and reports are created. These records are converted into sparse vector models for use in further machine learning efforts. Classifiers used to synthesise the results of this study included kNN, DT, RF, AdaBoost, SGD, extra trees and the Gaussian NB classifier. After reviewing the test and experimental data for all five classifiers, we found that the RF, SGD, extra trees and Gaussian NB Classifier all achieved a 100% accuracy in the test, as well as a perfect precision (1.00), a good recall (1.00), and a good f1-score (1.00). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the proof-of-concept employing autonomous behaviour-based malware analysis and machine learning methodologies might identify malware effectively and rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, in a world full of uncertainties and the threat of digital and cyber-attacks, blockchain technology is one of the major critical developments playing a vital role in the creative professional world. Along with energy, finance, governance, etc., the healthcare sector is one of the most prominent areas where blockchain technology is being used. We all are aware that data constitute our wealth and our currency; vulnerability and security become even more significant and a vital point of concern for healthcare. Recent cyberattacks have raised the questions of planning, requirement, and implementation to develop more cyber-secure models. This paper is based on a blockchain that classifies network participants into clusters and preserves a single copy of the blockchain for every cluster. The paper introduces a novel blockchain mechanism for secure healthcare sector data management, which reduces the communicational and computational overhead costs compared to the existing bitcoin network and the lightweight blockchain architecture. The paper also discusses how the proposed design can be utilized to address the recognized threats. The experimental results show that, as the number of nodes rises, the suggested architecture speeds up ledger updates by 63% and reduces network traffic by 10 times.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity on a budget: Evaluating security and performance of open-source SIEM solutions for SMEs.",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates robust security measures to safeguard critical assets and data in today's evolving digital landscape. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of the global economy are particularly vulnerable to these threats due to inadequate protection for critical and sensitive information, budgetary constraints, and lack of cybersecurity expertise and personnel. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have emerged as pivotal tools for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents. While proprietary SIEM solutions have historically dominated the market, open-source SIEM systems have gained prominence for their accessibility and cost-effectiveness for SMEs. This article presents a comprehensive study focusing on the evaluation of open-source SIEM systems. The research investigates the capabilities of these open-source solutions in addressing modern security challenges and compliance with regulatory requirements. Performance aspects are explored through empirical testing in simulated enterprise-grade SME network environments to assess resource utilization, and real-time data processing capabilities. By providing a rigorous assessment of the security and performance features of open-source SIEM systems, this research offers valuable insights to cybersecurity practitioners, organizations seeking cost-effective security solutions, and the broader academic community. The findings shed light on the strengths and limitations of these systems, aiding decision-makers in selecting the most suitable SIEM solution for their specific requirements while enhancing the cybersecurity posture of SMEs.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has brought about a profound transformation in our daily lives and work environments. However, this proliferation has also given rise to significant security challenges, as cybercriminals increasingly target IoT devices to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to sensitive data. This escalating threat landscape poses a severe issue across diverse domains where IoT is deployed, including agriculture, healthcare, and surveillance. In the realm of agriculture, where farmers have historically contended with pests and environmental challenges, a new adversary has emerged in the form of cyber criminals. The agriculture sector has witnessed a surge in cyber-attacks targeting smart agriculture solutions despite being a relatively recent addition to the industry. Farmers may not have control over the actions of cyber adversaries, but they possess the ability to make informed purchasing decisions when adopting smart farming solutions and implementing fundamental security measures, such as robust user credentials and regular system updates. In this regard, this research introduces a groundbreaking approach to addressing the cybersecurity concerns associated with smart agriculture-deception technology. Overall, deception technology involves the creation of deceptive elements, including decoys, traps, and false information, designed to divert cybercriminals away from genuine data and systems where this research presents a novel cyber threat intelligence platform that leverages deception technology to assess and mitigate the risks associated with smart agriculture as the first of its kind research. Based on the insights derived from the experimental work, actionable recommendations would be provided to relevant stakeholders on how to mitigate cyber risks and bolster the security posture of IoT-enabled smart agriculture. Overall, this innovative approach represents a significant step towards safeguarding the increasingly interconnected world of smart agriculture, offering a promising avenue for defending against the escalating cyber threats faced by this vital industry.",

    "abstract": "Online service providers (OSPs)-such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter-significantly shape the informational environment (infosphere) and influence users' experiences and interactions within it. There is a general agreement on the centrality of OSPs in information societies, but little consensus about what principles should shape their moral responsibilities and practices. In this article, we analyse the main contributions to the debate on the moral responsibilities of OSPs. By endorsing the method of the levels of abstract (LoAs), we first analyse the moral responsibilities of OSPs in the web (LoA ). These concern the management of online information, which includes information filtering, Internet censorship, the circulation of harmful content, and the implementation and fostering of human rights (including privacy). We then consider the moral responsibilities ascribed to OSPs on the web (LoA ) and focus on the existing legal regulation of access to users' data. The overall analysis provides an overview of the current state of the debate and highlights two main results. First, topics related to OSPs' public role-especially their gatekeeping function, their corporate social responsibilities, and their role in implementing and fostering human rights-have acquired increasing relevance in the specialised literature. Second, there is a lack of an ethical framework that can (a) define OSPs' responsibilities, and (b) provide the fundamental sharable principles necessary to guide OSPs' conduct within the multicultural and international context in which they operate. This article contributes to the ethical framework necessary to deal with (a) and (b) by endorsing a LoA enabling the definition of the responsibilities of OSPs with respect to the well-being of the infosphere and of the entities inhabiting it (LoA ).",

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks are increasing in both number and severity for private, corporate, and governmental bodies. To prevent these attacks, many intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems provide computer security by monitoring network packets and auditing system records. However, most of these systems only monitor network packets rather than the computer itself, so physical intrusion is also an important security issue. Furthermore, with the rapid progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, security problems of IoT devices are also increasing. Many IoT devices can be disassembled for decompilation, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. To prevent this, physical intrusion detection systems of the IoT should be considered. We here propose a physical security system that can protect data from unauthorized access when the computer chassis is opened or tampered with. Sensor switches monitor the chassis status at all times and upload event logs to a cloud server for remote monitoring. If the system finds that the computer has an abnormal condition, it takes protective measures and notifies the administrator. This system can be extended to IoT devices to protect their data from theft.",

    "abstract": "Advances in biomedical data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are profoundly changing the landscape of healthcare. This article reviews the ethical issues that arise with the development of AI technologies, including threats to privacy, data security, consent, and justice, as they relate to donors of tissue and data. It also considers broader societal obligations, including the importance of assessing the unintended consequences of AI research in biomedicine. In addition, this article highlights the challenge of rapid AI development against the backdrop of disparate regulatory frameworks, calling for a global approach to address concerns around data misuse, unintended surveillance, and the equitable distribution of AI's benefits and burdens. Finally, a number of potential solutions to these ethical quandaries are offered. Namely, the merits of advocating for a collaborative, informed, and flexible regulatory approach that balances innovation with individual rights and public welfare, fostering a trustworthy AI-driven healthcare ecosystem, are discussed.",

    "title": "A Framework for Malicious Traffic Detection in IoT Healthcare Environment.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.",

    "title": "BRISK: Dynamic Encryption Based Cipher for Long Term Security.",
    "abstract": "Several emerging areas like the Internet of Things, sensor networks, healthcare and distributed networks feature resource-constrained devices that share secure and privacy-preserving data to accomplish some goal. The majority of standard cryptographic algorithms do not fit with these constrained devices due to heavy cryptographic components. In this paper, a new block cipher, BRISK, is proposed with a block size of 32-bit. The cipher design is straightforward due to simple round operations, and these operations can be efficiently run in hardware and suitable for software. Another major concept used with this cipher is dynamism during encryption for each session; that is, instead of using the same encryption algorithm, participants use different ciphers for each session. Professor Lars R. Knudsen initially proposed dynamic encryption in 2015, where the sender picks a cipher from a large pool of ciphers to encrypt the data and send it along with the encrypted message. The receiver does not know about the encryption technique used before receiving the cipher along with the message. However, in the proposed algorithm, instead of choosing a new cipher, the process uses the same cipher for each session, but varies the cipher specifications from a given small pool, e.g., the number of rounds, cipher components, etc. Therefore, the dynamism concept is used here in a different way.",

    "title": "A conceptual system dynamics model for cybersecurity assessment of connected and autonomous vehicles.",
    "abstract": "Emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology have a ubiquitous communication framework. It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust-across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. \"Fixes that Fail\", in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. \"Shifting the burden\", where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The \"limits to success\" triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, self-regulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system.",

    "title": "What good cyber resilience looks like.",
    "abstract": "In January 2012, the World Economic Forum made cyber attacks its fourth top global risk. In the 2013 risk report, cyber attacks were noted to be an even higher risk in absolute terms. The reliance of critical infrastructure on cyber working has never been higher; the frequency, intensity, impact and sophistication of attacks is growing. This trend looks likely to continue. It can be argued that it is no longer a question whether an organisation will be successfully hacked, but how long it will take to detect. In the ever-changing cyber environment, traditional protection techniques and reliance on preventive controls are not enough. A more agile approach is required to give assurance of a sufficiently secure digital society. Are we faced with a paradigm shift or a storm in a digital teacup? This paper offers an introduction to why cyber is important, a wider taxonomy on the topic and some historical context on how the discipline of cyber security has evolved, and an interpretation on what this means in the new normal of today.",

    "title": "PrivCore: Multiplication-activation co-reduction for efficient private inference.",
    "abstract": "The marriage of deep neural network (DNN) and secure 2-party computation (2PC) enables private inference (PI) on the encrypted client-side data and server-side models with both privacy and accuracy guarantees, coming at the cost of orders of magnitude communication and latency penalties. Prior works on designing PI-friendly network architectures are confined to mitigating the overheads associated with non-linear (e.g., ReLU) operations, assuming other linear computations are free. Recent works have shown that linear convolutions can no longer be ignored and are responsible for the majority of communication in PI protocols. In this work, we present PrivCore, a framework that jointly optimizes the alternating linear and non-linear DNN operators via a careful co-design of sparse Winograd convolution and fine-grained activation reduction, to improve high-efficiency ciphertext computation without impacting the inference precision. Specifically, being aware of the incompatibility between the spatial pruning and Winograd convolution, we propose a two-tiered Winograd-aware structured pruning method that removes spatial filters and Winograd vectors from coarse to fine-grained for multiplication reduction, both of which are specifically optimized for Winograd convolution in a structured pattern. PrivCore further develops a novel sensitivity-based differentiable activation approximation to automate the selection of ineffectual ReLUs and polynomial options. PrivCore also supports the dynamic determination of coefficient-adaptive polynomial replacement to mitigate the accuracy degradation. Extensive experiments on various models and datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of PrivCore, achieving 2.2× communication reduction with 1.8% higher accuracy compared with SENet (ICLR 2023) on CIFAR-100, and 2.0× total communication reduction with iso-accuracy compared with CoPriv (NeurIPS 2023) on ImageNet.",

    "abstract": "Eavesdroppers can easily intercept the data transmitted in a wireless sensor network (WSN) because of the network's open properties and constrained resources. Therefore, it is important to ensure data confidentiality in WSN with highly efficient security mechanisms. We proposed a lightweight security transmission method based on information hiding and random data flipping to ensure that the ally fusion center (AFC) can achieve confidential data transmission over insecure open links. First, the sensors' local measurements are coded into a customized binary string, and then before data transmission, some parts of the string are flipped by the sensors according to the outputs of a pre-deployed pseudo-random function. The AFC can recover the flipped binaries using the same function and extract the measurement hidden in the string, while the enemy fusion center (EFC) cannot distinguish flipped and non-flipped data at all, and they cannot restore the measurement correctly as long as one bit in the string is not correctly recovered. We proved the security and anti-interference of the scheme through both simulations and physical experiments. Furthermore, the proposed method is more efficient such that it consumes less power than traditional digital encryptions through real power consumption tests.",

    "abstract": "Medical database security is a particularly important issue for all Healthcare establishments. Medical information systems are intended to support a wide range of pertinent health issues today, for example: assure the quality of care, support effective management of the health services institutions, monitor and contain the cost of care, implement technology into care without violating social values, ensure the equity and availability of care, preserve humanity despite the proliferation of technology etc.. In this context, medical database security aims primarily to support: high availability, accuracy and consistency of the stored data, the medical professional secrecy and confidentiality, and the protection of the privacy of the patient. These properties, though of technical nature, basically require that the system is actually helpful for medical care and not harmful to patients. These later properties require in turn not only that fundamental ethical principles are not violated by employing database systems, but instead, are effectively enforced by technical means. This document reviews the existing and emerging work on the security of medical database systems. It presents in detail the related problems and requirements related to medical database security. It addresses the problems of medical database security policies, secure design methodologies and implementation techniques. It also describes the current legal framework and regulatory requirements for medical database security. The issue of medical database security guidelines is also examined in detailed. The current national and international efforts in the area are studied. It also gives an overview of the research work in the area. The document also presents in detail the most complete to our knowledge set of security guidelines for the development and operation of medical database systems.",

    "abstract": "Smart healthcare systems play a vital role in the current era of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); i.e. Industry 4.0. Medical data security has become the integral part of smart hospital applications to ensure data privacy and patient data security. Usually, patient medical reports and diagnostic images are transferred to the specialist physician in other hospitals for effective diagnostics. Therefore, the transmission of medical data over the internet has attained significant interest among many researchers. The three main challenges associated with the e-healthcare systems are the following: (1) ensuring authentication of medical information; (2) transmission of medical image and patient health record (PHR) should not cause data mismatch/detachment; and (3) medical image should not be modified accidentally or intentionally as they are transmitted over the insecure medium. Thus, it is highly essential to ensure the integrity of the medical image, especially the region of interest (ROI) before taking any diagnostic decisions. Watermarking is a well-known technique used to overcome these challenges. The current research work has developed a watermarking algorithm to ensure integrity and authentication of the medical data and image. In this paper, a novel watermarking algorithm is designed based on Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT), combined chaotic map, recovery bit generation and SHA-256 to address the objective as mentioned earlier. The paper's significant contribution is divided into four phases, namely, watermark generation and data embedding phase, authentication phase, tamper detection phase and localisation and lossless recovery phase. Experiments are carried out to prove that the developed IWT-based data embedding scheme offers high robustness to the data embedded in region of non-interest (RONI), detects and localises the tampered blocks inside ROI with 100% accuracy and recovers the tampered segments of ROI with zero MSE. Further, a comparison is made with the state-of-art schemes to verify the sternness of the developed system.",

    "abstract": "Practical applications for data analysis may require combining multiple databases belonging to different owners, such as health centers. The analysis should be performed without violating privacy of neither the centers themselves, nor the patients whose records these centers store. To avoid biased analysis results, it may be important to remove duplicate records among the centers, so that each patient's data would be taken into account only once. This task is very closely related to privacy-preserving record linkage. This paper presents a solution to privacy-preserving deduplication among records of several databases using secure multiparty computation. It is build upon one of the fastest practical secure multiparty computation platforms, called Sharemind. The tests on ca 10 million records of simulated databases with 1000 health centers of 10000 records each show that the computation is feasible in practice. The expected running time of the experiment is ca. 30 min for computing servers connected over 100 Mbit/s WAN, the expected error of the results is 2 , and no errors have been detected for the particular test set that we used for our benchmarks. The solution is ready for practical use. It has well-defined security properties, implied by the properties of Sharemind platform. The solution assumes that exact matching of records is required, and a possible future research would be extending it to approximate matching.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information processing made a tremendous and remarkable impact on number of classical mechanic's problems. The impact does not only stop at classical mechanics but also the cyber security paradigm. Quantum information and cryptography are two classes of quantum information processing which use the idea of qubits instead of bits as in classical information security. The idea of fast computations with multiple complexity level is becoming more realistic in the age of quantum information due to quantum parallelism where a single quantum computer does allow to compute hundreds of classical computers with less efforts and more accuracy. The evolution of quantum information processing replaces a number of classical mechanic's aspects in computational and cyber security sciences. Our aim here is to introduce concepts of applied quantum dynamics in cryptography, which leads to an evolution of quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography is one of the most astonishing solicitations of quantum information theory. To measure the quantum state of any system is not possible without disturbing that system. The facts of quantum mechanics on traditional cryptosystems lead to a new protocol and achieving maximum remarkable security for systems. The scope of this paper is to design an innovative encryption scheme for digital data based on quantum spinning and rotation operators.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable achievements and have been extensively applied in various downstream tasks, such as node classification and community detection. However, recent studies have demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations on graphs, including node injection attacks, which negatively affect downstream tasks. Existing node injection attacks have mainly focused on the limited local nodes, neglecting the analysis of the whole graph which restricts the attack's ability. In this paper, we propose a novel global graph attack method named Spectral Node Injection Attack (SpNIA), which takes into account the spectral distance to more effectively leverage the limited adversarial budgets. Specifically, we maximize the Euclidean distance of eigenvalues decomposed from the Laplacian matrices of original and injected graph, and solve the optimization problem by gradient-based methods. Due to the different dimensions of matrices in original and injected graph, we construct a novel optimization framework of the node injection attack which also allows injected nodes to connect with each other for more malicious message passing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets indicate significant decrease in GNNs performance and show empirical evidences to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of SpNIA.",

The massive utilization of the web raises stress over how to pass on electronic information safely. Usually, intruders try different attacks for getting sensitive information.

In this paper, stream data mining is incorporated with an IDS to do a specific task. The task is to distinguish the important, covered up information successfully in less amount of time. The experiment focuses on improving the effectiveness of an IDS using the proposed Stacked Autoencoder Hoeffding Tree approach (SAE-HT) using Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) for feature selection. The experiment is performed in NSL_KDD dataset the important features are obtained using DPSO and the classification is performed using proposed SAE-HT technique. The proposed technique achieves a higher accuracy of 97.7% when compared with all the other state-of-art techniques. It is observed that the proposed technique increases the accuracy and detection rate thus reducing the false alarm rate.",

    "abstract": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) provide a mechanism of transmitting a persons physiological data to application providers e.g. hospital. Given the limited range of connectivity associated with WBAN, an intermediate portable device e.g. smartphone, placed within WBAN's connectivity, forwards the data to a remote server. This data, if not protected from an unauthorized access and modification may be lead to poor diagnosis. In order to ensure security and privacy between WBAN and a server at the application provider, several authentication schemes have been proposed. Recently, Wang and Zhang proposed an authentication scheme for WBAN using bilinear pairing. However, in their scheme, an application provider could easily impersonate a client. In order to overcome this weakness, we propose an efficient remote authentication scheme for WBAN. In terms of performance, our scheme can not only provide a malicious insider security, but also reduce running time of WBAN (client) by 51 % as compared to Wang and Zhang scheme.",

However, security remains a key factor that could limit their further growth potential. We reviewed and assessed the potential use of the cryptographic technique to resolve security issues. We also analyzed services available in the current market environment and determined their viability in supporting health care applications. While the cryptographic application has a great potential in protecting security of health care information transmitted over the Internet, a nationwide security infrastructure is needed to support deployment of the technology. Although desirable, it could be cost prohibitive to build a national system to be dedicated for the health care purpose. A hybrid approach that involves the government's development of a dedicated security infrastructure for health care providers and the use of commercial off-the-shelf products and services by the general public offers the most cost-effective and viable approach.",

    "abstract": "Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emergence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency.Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard.",

Big data analytics finds its application in population health management and clinical decision-support systems even in developing countries. The major challenges towards the integration of big data analytics in the healthcare sector in developing countries include fragmentation of healthcare data and lack of interoperability, data security, privacy and confidentiality concerns, limited resources and inadequate regulatory and policy frameworks for governing big data analytics technologies and limited reliable power and internet infrastructures. Digitalization of healthcare delivery in developing countries faces several significant challenges.

    "abstract": "Control-flow attestation (CFA) is a mechanism that securely logs software execution paths running on remote devices. It can detect whether a device is being control-flow hijacked by launching a challenge-response process. In the growing landscape of the Internet of Things, more and more peer devices need to communicate to share sensed data and conduct inter-operations without the involvement of a trusted center. Toward the scalability of CFA mechanisms and mitigating the single-point failure, it is important to design a decentralized CFA schema. This paper proposed a decentralized schema (CFRV) to verify the control flow on remote devices. Moreover, it introduces a token (asymmetric secret slices) into peer devices to make the attestation process mutual. In this case, CFRV can mitigate a particular kind of man-in-the-middle attack called . We built our prototype toolbox on Raspberry-Pi to formulate our proof of concept. In our evaluation, CFRV protects the verification process from malicious verifiers and the man-in-the-middle attack. The proposed mechanism can also limit the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) usage to a single stage to save the peer devices' computational cost. Compared to related decentralized schemes, the cryptographic operation's duration is reduced by 40%.",

Prior molecular keypad locks have an output signal dependent upon not only the appropriate combination but also the exact sequence of inputs, but it cannot be reset or reprogrammed. Here, a DNA-based security system with reset and never-reported reprogram function is successfully developed in proof-of-principle, with which one can change the password in case that the system is cracked. The previous password becomes invalid in the reprogrammed security system. Interestingly, more than one password is designed to permit multiple users to access. By harnessing the intrinsic merit of the different passwords, the system can distinguish different user who is endowed with prior authority. The intelligent device is addressed on solid support and facilitates electronic processes, avoiding chemical accumulation in the system by simple removal of the electrode from the input solution and indicating a main avenue for its further development.",

An ideal aggregate signature scheme is an identity-based aggregate signature (IBAS) scheme that supports full aggregation since it can reduce the total transmitted data by using an identity string as a public key and anyone can freely aggregate different signatures. Constructing a secure IBAS scheme that supports full aggregation in bilinear maps is an important open problem. Recently, Yuan et al. proposed such a scheme and claimed its security in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.

However, the marked image qualities of these schemes can be enhanced, and their authentication methods may fail to detect some special tampering. We propose a secure AMBTC tamper detection scheme that preserves high image fidelity with excellent detectability. In the proposed approach, a bit in bitmaps of AMBTC codes is sequentially toggled to generate a set of authentication codes. The one that causes the least distortion is embedded into the quantization levels with the guidance of a key-generated reference table (RT). Without the correct key, the same reference table cannot be constructed. Therefore, the proposed method is able to detect various kinds of malicious tampering, including those special tampering techniques designed for RT-based authentication schemes. The proposed method not only offers better image quality, but also provides an excellent and satisfactory detectability as compared with previous works.",

    "abstract": "Current blockchain-based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self-adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self-adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so-called self-adaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE-BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self-adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the -test and Mann-Whitney test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self-adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan.",

We used data on hospital ransomware attacks from the Tracking Healthcare Ransomware Events and Traits database, linked to American Hospital Association survey data and Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims data from 2016 to 2021. We measured Medicare FFS volume and revenue in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room setting-at the hospital-week level. We then conducted a stacked event study analysis, comparing hospital volume and revenue at ransomware-attacked and nonattacked hospitals before and after attacks. Ransomware attacks severely disrupted hospital operations-with comparable effects observed at rural versus urban hospitals. During the first week of the attack, inpatient admissions volume fell by 14.7% at rural hospitals (P = .04) and 16.9% at urban hospitals (P = .01)-recovering to preattack levels within 2-3 weeks. Outpatient visits fell by 35.3% at rural hospitals (P<.01) and 22.0% at urban hospitals (P = .03) during the first week. Emergency room visits fell by 10.0% at rural hospitals (P = .04) and 19.3% at urban hospitals (P = .01). Travel time and distance to the closest nonattacked hospital was 4-7 times greater for rural ransomware-attacked hospitals than for urban ransomware-attacked hospitals. Ransomware attacks disrupted hospital operations in rural and urban areas. Disruptions of similar magnitudes may be more detrimental in rural areas, given the greater distances patients must travel to receive care and the outsized impact that lost revenue may have on rural hospital finances.",

Image sharing is a secure and fault-tolerant method for protecting digital images, which can reduce the risk of information loss. In this paper, a new visual sharing method is proposed for protecting the security of the medical images. The patient information is firstly embedded into a medical image. Then the medical image with patient information can be divided into several shared images and protected by different participator. The original patient information and medical image can be retrieved by collecting the shared images. Experimental results can demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Ethical approach to the genetic, biometric and health data protection and processing in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (2018).",
    "abstract": "The main purpose of the present paper is to analyze the rules for processing of special categories of personal data (genetic data, including biological samples, biometric and health data) in the light of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thus contributing to overview the health status and the biomedical state of the data subject. Over the last two decades, debating the European Union's (EU) major legislation with regard to personal data and patients' rights became relevant for the scientific research. The paper assesses the basic legal provisions with regard to the genetic, biometric and data concerning health considered as \"sensitive data\", while safeguarding the ethical standards of the scientific research. The present article investigates the ethical and legal approaches to processing personal data in the understanding of the new regulatory guidelines regarding the data protection, here including the health status and the rights of a data subject. The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric and health data and the free movement of such data are reinforced in the new GDPR entered into force in May 2016 and applied from 25 May 2018. The new legal context elucidates: the special categories of personal data (\"sensitive data\"), the \"consent\" and the research exemption by explicitly recognizing the \"pseudonymised\" data. Although the new guidelines revisit the EU data protection reform, it also grants the EU Member States the right to maintain or introduce further limitations to the processing of such data.",

    "title": "Imperceptible reversible watermarking of radiographic images based on quantum noise masking.",
    "abstract": "Advances in information and communication technologies boost the sharing and remote access to medical images. Along with this evolution, needs in terms of data security are also increased. Watermarking can contribute to better protect images by dissimulating into their pixels some security attributes (e.g., digital signature, user identifier). But, to take full advantage of this technology in healthcare, one key problem to address is to ensure that the image distortion induced by the watermarking process does not endanger the image diagnosis value. To overcome this issue, reversible watermarking is one solution. It allows watermark removal with the exact recovery of the image. Unfortunately, reversibility does not mean that imperceptibility constraints are relaxed. Indeed, once the watermark removed, the image is unprotected. It is thus important to ensure the invisibility of reversible watermark in order to ensure a permanent image protection. We propose a new fragile reversible watermarking scheme for digital radiographic images, the main originality of which stands in masking a reversible watermark into the image quantum noise (the dominant noise in radiographic images). More clearly, in order to ensure the watermark imperceptibility, our scheme differentiates the image black background, where message embedding is conducted into pixel gray values with the well-known histogram shifting (HS) modulation, from the anatomical object, where HS is applied to wavelet detail coefficients, masking the watermark with the image quantum noise. In order to maintain the watermark embedder and reader synchronized in terms of image partitioning and insertion domain, our scheme makes use of different classification processes that are invariant to message embedding. We provide the theoretical performance limits of our scheme into the image quantum noise in terms of image distortion and message size (i.e. capacity). Experiments conducted on more than 800 12 bits radiographic images of different anatomical structures show that our scheme induces a very low image distortion (PSNR∼ 76.5 dB) for a relatively important capacity (capacity∼ 0.02 bits of message per pixel). The proposed watermarking scheme, while being reversible, preserves the diagnosis value of radiographic images by masking the watermark into the quantum noise. As theoretically and experimentally established our scheme offers a good capacity/image quality compromise that can support different watermarking based security services such as integrity and authenticity control. The watermark can be kept into the image during the interpretation of the image, offering thus a continuous protection. Such a masking strategy can be seen as the first psychovisual model for radiographic images. The reversibility allows the watermark update when necessary.",

    "abstract": "The recent introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation and Health Research Regulations has been an area of significant concern for those engaged in clinical research. These European regulations, following subsequent interpretation by Ireland's Department of Health, now place Ireland in a unique position which differs substantially from other European countries and may prove a significant impediment to Irish clinical research, depriving Irish patients of timely access to potentially life-saving treatments and making Ireland less attractive to pharmaceutical companies engaged in this area. At the very least, the regulations, as applied in Ireland, will place a significant extra burden of work on Ireland's clinical researchers and at their worst will force individuals and institutions out of the clinical research field, which will result in significant loss to the Irish knowledge economy and lead to the detriment of patient care. In this article, we explore what exactly is proposed by Europe's GDPR and by Ireland's Health Research Regulations. We look at the challenges presented to clinical researchers, and we highlight those areas, which need clarification by the Department of Health and by the Data Protection Commissioner. We propose five recommendations, which would ameliorate some of the more restrictive impositions of these regulations. This review was commissioned by the Irish Academy of Medical Science.",

    "title": "Authorized Shared Electronic Medical Record System with Proxy Re-Encryption and Blockchain Technology.",
    "abstract": "With the popularity of the internet 5G network, the network constructions of hospitals have also rapidly developed. Operations management in the healthcare system is becoming paperless, for example, via a shared electronic medical record (EMR) system. A shared electronic medical record system plays an important role in reducing diagnosis costs and improving diagnostic accuracy. In the traditional electronic medical record system, centralized database storage is typically used. Once there is a problem with the data storage, it could cause data privacy disclosure and security risks. Blockchain is tamper-proof and data traceable. It can ensure the security and correctness of data. Proxy re-encryption technology can ensure the safe sharing and transmission of relatively sensitive data. Based on the above situation, we propose an electronic medical record system based on consortium blockchain and proxy re-encryption to solve the problem of EMR security sharing. Electronic equipment in this process is connected to the blockchain network, and the security of data access is ensured through the automatic execution of blockchain chaincodes; the attribute-based access control method ensures fine-grained access to the data and improves the system security. Compared with the existing electronic medical records based on cloud storage, the system not only realizes the sharing of electronic medical records, but it also has advantages in privacy protection, access control, data security, etc.",

    "abstract": "Current image encryption methods have many shortcomings for the medical image encryption with high resolution, strong correlation and large storage space, and it is difficult to obtain reliable clinically applicable medical images. Therefore, this paper proposes a medical image encryption algorithm based on a new five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system and genetic operation. And the dynamic analysis of the phase diagram and bifurcation diagram of the five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system selected in this paper is carried out, and NIST is used to test the randomness of its chaotic sequence. This algorithm follows the diffusion-scrambling framework, especially using the principle of DNA recombination combined with the five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system to generate a chaotic matrix that participates in the operation. The bit-level DNA mutation operation is introduced in the diffusion, and the scrambling and diffusion effects have been further improved. Algorithm security and randomness have been enhanced. This paper evaluates the efficiency of this algorithm for medical image encryption in terms of security analysis and time performance. Security analysis is carried out from key space, information entropy, histogram, similarity between decrypted image and original image, PSNR, correlation, sensitivity, noise attack, cropping attack and so on. Perform time efficiency analysis from the perspective of time performance. The comparison between this algorithm and the experimental results obtained by some of the latest medical image encryption algorithms shows that this algorithm is superior to the existing medical image encryption algorithms to a certain extent in terms of security and time efficiency.",

The application background of blockchain technology in real-time tracking algorithm of e-commerce logistics information is firstly described. Also, the blockchain technology, logistics information real-time tracking algorithm, cryptography technology, blockchain consensus algorithm, blockchain application scenarios, and other related technologies are analyzed in detail. Then, the blockchain model of real-time tracking of e-commerce logistics information is established, and it is found that data will be stored on the chain only when more than 51% of the nodes in the distributed system confirm that the data are valid. Otherwise, the data on the chain cannot be affected. Finally, the model description and hypothesis of real-time tracking of e-commerce logistics information based on blockchain technology are verified to provide guarantee for improving real-time tracking of e-commerce logistics information.",

    "abstract": "Self-sovereign identity authentication protocol is an active research topic in the field of identity authentication and management. However, the current SSI authentication protocols pay little attention to privacy protection and the fine-grained access control. Therefore, a secure and decentralized SSI authentication protocol with privacy protection and fine-grained access control is proposed. Firstly, the formal model of SSI including the SDPP-SSI identity model and management model is presented. And then, based on the federated blockchain, the distributed identifier is used as a global identifier for users in the decentralized domain. Finally, the verifiable statement is encapsulated using a policy control signature supporting privacy protection to develop the user's access control for identity registration in the centralized domain. Compared with the related work (Lin 2018, Zhu 2018, Stokkink 2018, Hammudoglu 2017, Othman 2017, Abraham 2018, Guan 2019, Lin 2019) from controllability, security, flexibility, privacy protection, authentication and fine-grained access control, the proposed SSI authentication protocol not only meets controllability, authentication, and flexibility, but also supports privacy protection and fine-grained access control.",

    "title": "Heuristically enhanced multi-head attention based recurrent neural network for denial of wallet attacks detection on serverless computing environment.",
    "abstract": "Denial of Wallet (DoW) attacks are a cyber threat designed to utilize and deplete an organization's financial resources by generating excessive prices or charges in their cloud computing (CC) and serverless computing platforms. These threats are primarily appropriate in serverless manners because of features such as auto-scaling, pay-as-you-go, restricted control, and cost growth. Serverless computing, frequently recognized as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), is a CC method that permits designers to construct and run uses without the requirement to accomplish typical server structure. Detecting DoW threats involves monitoring and analyzing the system-level resource consumption of specific bare-metal mechanisms. Efficient and precise detection of internal DoW threats remains a crucial challenge. Timely recognition is significant in preventing potential damage, as DoW attacks exploit the financial model of serverless environments, impacting the cost structure and operational integrity of services. In this study, a Multi-Head Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network for Denial of Wallet Attacks Detection (MHARNN-DoWAD) technique is developed. The MHARNN-DoWAD method enables the detection of DoW attacks on serverless computing environments. At first, the presented MHARNN-DoWAD model performs data preprocessing by using min-max normalization to convert input data into constant format. Next, the wolf pack predation (WPP) method is employed for feature selection. The detection and classification of DoW attacks, the multi-head attention-based bi-directional gated recurrent unit (MHA-BiGRU) model is utilized. Eventually, the improved secretary bird optimizer algorithm (ISBOA)-based hyperparameter choice process is accomplished to optimize the detection results of the MHA-BiGRU model. A comprehensive set of simulations was conducted to demonstrate the promising results of the MHARNN-DoWAD method. The experimental validation of the MHARNN-DoWAD technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.30% over existing models.",

    "abstract": "Over the last couple of years, Blockchain technology has emerged as a game-changer for various industry domains, ranging from FinTech and the supply chain to healthcare and education, thereby enabling them to meet the competitive market demands and end-user requirements. Blockchain technology gained its popularity after the massive success of Bitcoin, of which it constitutes the backbone technology. While blockchain is still emerging and finding its foothold across domains, Cloud computing is comparatively well defined and established. Organizations such as Amazon, IBM, Google, and Microsoft have extensively invested in Cloud and continue to provide a plethora of related services to a wide range of customers. The pay-per-use policy and easy access to resources are some of the biggest advantages of Cloud, but it continues to face challenges like data security, compliance, interoperability, and data management. In this article, we present the advantages of integrating Cloud and blockchain technology along with applications of Blockchain-as-a-Service. The article presents itself with a detailed survey illustrating recent works combining the amalgamation of both technologies. The survey also talks about blockchain-cloud services being offered by existing Cloud Service providers.",

    "title": "Security of the electronic health care record--professional and ethical implications.",
    "abstract": "Many challenges face developers of secure computerised clinical systems but the technical problems are overshadowed by procedural, professional and ethical issues. The development and use of computerised systems must be controlled through compliance with standards and procedures for information security, enforced through national legislation and professional codes of conduct, if serious abuse of the data is to be avoided. Health care professionals cannot be expected to acquire working knowledge of how information systems are made secure since this is a technical and highly complex subject. However, it is essential that health care professionals understand why it is important to maintain a secure environment for the records they keep about patients and their care and how this can be organised. This is best achieved through a well structured educational programme involving all trainee and qualified health care staff, a task which should be coordinated by the national professional bodies. A management structure is needed within health care facilities that recognises the responsibility of health care professionals to keep the health care data relating to their patients secure. An arrangement is proposed that gives the most senior clinician in a health care facility the ultimate responsibility for security of health care data held in the organisation. Where appropriate, this would be delegated to a senior clinician with training and experience in information systems and their security. This 'information doctor' would, with the assistance of computer experts and health care managers, implement and monitor the organisation's information security strategy. Contracts should be developed between health care facilities and their patients, defining the limits to the use and disclosure of personal health data. Similar contracts with external agencies should also stipulate the minimum level of security to be applied to health records shared between the organisations.",

The embedding is done when the original image is compressed using the embedded zero-tree wavelet (EZW) algorithm. The extraction process is performed at the decompression time of the watermarked image. Our algorithm has been tested on several CT and MRI images and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) between the original and watermarked image is greater than 35 dB for watermarking of 512 to 8192 bytes of the mark signal. The proposed method is able to utilize about 15% of the host image to embed the mark signal. This marking percentage has improved previous works while preserving the image details.",

In the present paper, we consider the keyword search problem further and introduce a novel notion called attribute-based proxy re-encryption with keyword search (ABRKS), which introduces a promising feature: In addition to supporting keyword search on encrypted data, it enables data owners to delegate the keyword search capability to some other data users complying with the specific access control policy. To be specific, ABRKS allows (i) the data owner to outsource his encrypted data to the cloud and then ask the cloud to conduct keyword search on outsourced encrypted data with the given search token, and (ii) the data owner to delegate other data users keyword search capability in the fine-grained access control manner through allowing the cloud to re-encrypted stored encrypted data with a re-encrypted data (embedding with some form of access control policy). We formalize the syntax and security definitions for ABRKS, and propose two concrete constructions for ABRKS: key-policy ABRKS and ciphertext-policy ABRKS. In the nutshell, our constructions can be treated as the integration of technologies in the fields of attribute-based cryptography and proxy re-encryption cryptography.",

Although no cyberattack leading to patient harm has been reported to date, the threat is real and has been demonstrated in research laboratory scenarios and echoed in patient concerns. The CIED universe comprises a complex interplay of devices, connectivity protocols, and sensitive information flow between the devices and the central cloud server. Various manufacturers use proprietary software and black-box connectivity protocols that are susceptible to hacking.

    "abstract": "Both reliable detection of the primary signal in a noisy and fading environment and nullifying the effect of unauthorized users are important tasks in cognitive radio networks. To address these issues, we consider a cooperative spectrum sensing approach where each user is assigned nonuniform reliability based on the sensing performance. Users with poor channel or faulty sensor are assigned low reliability. The nonuniform reliabilities serve as identification tags and are used to isolate users with malicious behavior. We consider a link layer attack similar to the Byzantine attack, which falsifies the spectrum sensing data. Three different strategies are presented in this paper to ignore unreliable and malicious users in the network. Considering only reliable users for global decision improves sensing time and decreases collisions in the control channel. The fusion center uses the degree of reliability as a weighting factor to determine the global decision in scheme I. Schemes II and III consider the unreliability of users, which makes the computations even simpler. The proposed schemes reduce the number of sensing reports and increase the inference accuracy. The advantages of our proposed schemes over conventional cooperative spectrum sensing and the Chair-Varshney optimum rule are demonstrated through simulations.",

    "abstract": "The use of low-cost sensors in IoT over high-cost devices has been considered less expensive. However, these low-cost sensors have their own limitations such as the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the data collected. Fog computing offers solutions to those limitations; nevertheless, owning to its intrinsic distributed architecture, it faces challenges in the form of security of fog devices, secure authentication and privacy. Blockchain technology has been utilised to offer solutions for the authentication and security challenges in fog systems. This paper proposes an authentication system that utilises the characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email address, username, Ethereum address, password and data from a biometric reader to register and authenticate users. Experiments showed that the proposed method is secure and achieved performance improvement when compared to existing methods. The comparison of results with state-of-the-art showed that the proposed authentication system consumed up to 30% fewer resources in transaction and execution cost; however, there was an increase of up to 30% in miner fees.",

    "abstract": "Although data protection is compulsory when personal data is shared, there is no systematic method available to evaluate to what extent each individual is at risk of a privacy breach. We use a collection of measures that quantify how much information is needed to uncover sensitive information. Combined with visualization techniques, our approach can be used to perform a detailed privacy analysis of medical data. Because privacy is evaluated per variable, these adjustments can be made while incorporating how likely it is that these variables will be exploited to uncover sensitive information in practice, as is mandatory in the European Union. Additionally, the analysis of privacy can be used to evaluate to what extent knowledge on specific variables in the data can contribute to privacy breaches, which can subsequently guide the use of anonymization techniques, such as generalization.",

The distribution structure model of health privacy data blockchain inside and outside the university physical education class is established, arithmetic coding and quantitative feature analysis methods to schedule and adaptively control health privacy data blockchain inside and outside the university physical education class are adopted, public key coding configuration and vector quantization coding methods are combined to design encryption keys in the process of health privacy data transmission inside and outside the university physical education class, and blockchain hybrid encryption algorithm is adopted to design encryption keys for health privacy data inside and outside the university physical education class.

    "title": "Ensuring General Data Protection Regulation Compliance and Security in a Clinical Data Warehouse From a University Hospital: Implementation Study.",
    "abstract": "The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has profoundly influenced health data management, with significant implications for clinical data warehouses (CDWs). In 2021, France pioneered a national framework for GDPR-compliant CDW implementation, established by its data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés). This framework provides detailed guidelines for health care institutions, offering a unique opportunity to assess practical GDPR implementation in health data management. This study evaluates the real-world applicability of France's CDW framework through its implementation at a major university hospital. It identifies practical challenges for its implementation by health institutions and proposes adaptations relevant to regulatory authorities in order to facilitate research in secondary use data domains. A systematic assessment was conducted in May 2023 at the University Hospital of Rennes, which manages data for over 2 million patients through the eHOP CDW system. The evaluation examined 116 criteria across 13 categories using a dual-assessment approach validated by information security and data protection officers. Compliance was rated as met, unmet, or not applicable, with criteria classified as software-related (n=25) or institution-related (n=91). Software-related criteria showed 60% (n=15) compliance, with 28% (n=7) noncompliant or partially compliant and 12% (n=3) not applicable. Institution-related criteria achieved 72% (n=28) compliance for security requirements. Key challenges included managing genetic data, implementing automated archiving, and controlling data exports. The findings revealed effective privacy protection measures but also highlighted areas requiring regulatory adjustments to better support research. This first empirical assessment of a national CDW compliance framework offers valuable insights for health care institutions implementing GDPR requirements. While the framework establishes robust privacy protections, certain provisions may overly constrain research activities. The study identifies opportunities for framework evolution, balancing data protection with research imperatives.",

The protocol used the Delegated Proof of Stake(DPOS) algorithm to select the proxy node, which reencrypted the EHR to share data between a pair of users.

    "abstract": "With countless devices connected to the Internet of Things, trust mechanisms are especially important. IoT devices are more deeply embedded in the privacy of people's lives, and their security issues cannot be ignored. Smart contracts backed by blockchain technology have the potential to solve these problems. Therefore, the security of smart contracts cannot be ignored. We propose a flexible and systematic hybrid model, which we call the Serial-Parallel Convolutional Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Network Model incorporating Ensemble Classifiers (SPCBIG-EC). The model showed excellent performance benefits in smart contract vulnerability detection. In addition, we propose a serial-parallel convolution (SPCNN) suitable for our hybrid model. It can extract features from the input sequence for multivariate combinations while retaining temporal structure and location information. The Ensemble Classifier is used in the classification phase of the model to enhance its robustness. In addition, we focused on six typical smart contract vulnerabilities and constructed two datasets, CESC and UCESC, for multi-task vulnerability detection in our experiments. Numerous experiments showed that SPCBIG-EC is better than most existing methods. It is worth mentioning that SPCBIG-EC can achieve F1-scores of 96.74%, 91.62%, and 95.00% for reentrancy, timestamp dependency, and infinite loop vulnerability detection.",

    "title": "Reconciling the biomedical data commons and the GDPR: three lessons from the EUCAN ELSI collaboratory.",
    "abstract": "The coming-into-force of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a watershed moment in the legal recognition of enforceable rights to informational self-determination. The rapid evolution of legal requirements applicable to data use, however, has the potential to outstrip the capabilities of networks of biomedical data users to respond to the shifting norms. It can also delegitimate established institutional bodies that are responsible for assessing and authorising the downstream use of data, including research ethics committees and institutional data custodians. These burdens are especially pronounced for clinical and research networks that are of transnational scale, because the legal compliance burden for outbound international data transfers from the EEA is especially high. Legislatures, courts, and regulators in the EU should therefore implement the following three legal changes. First, the responsibilities of particular actors in a data sharing network should be delimited through the contractual allocation of responsibilities between collaborators. Second, the use of data through secure data processing environments should not trigger the international transfer provisions of the GDPR. Third, the use of federated data analysis methodologies that do not provide analysis nodes or downstream users access to identifiable personal data as part of the outputs of those analyses should not be considered circumstances of joint controllership, nor lead to the users of non-identifiable data to be considered controllers or processors. These small clarifications of, or modifications to, the GDPR would facilitate the exchange of biomedical data amongst clinicians and researchers.",

    "title": "Blockchain-Based Data Access Control and Key Agreement System in IoT Environment.",
    "abstract": "Recently, with the increasing application of the Internet of Things (IoT), various IoT environments such as smart factories, smart homes, and smart grids are being generated. In the IoT environment, a lot of data are generated in real time, and the generated IoT data can be used as source data for various services such as artificial intelligence, remote medical care, and finance, and can also be used for purposes such as electricity bill generation. Therefore, data access control is required to grant access rights to various data users in the IoT environment who need such IoT data. In addition, IoT data contain sensitive information such as personal information, so privacy protection is also essential. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology has been utilized to address these requirements. Furthermore, system structures applying blockchains with CP-ABE are being studied to prevent bottlenecks and single failures of cloud servers, as well as to support data auditing. However, these systems do not stipulate authentication and key agreement to ensure the security of the data transmission process and data outsourcing. Accordingly, we propose a data access control and key agreement scheme using CP-ABE to ensure data security in a blockchain-based system. In addition, we propose a system that can provide data nonrepudiation, data accountability, and data verification functions by utilizing blockchains. Both formal and informal security verifications are performed to demonstrate the security of the proposed system. We also compare the security, functional aspects, and computational and communication costs of previous systems. Furthermore, we perform cryptographic calculations to analyze the system in practical terms. As a result, our proposed protocol is safer against attacks such as guessing attacks and tracing attacks than other protocols, and can provide mutual authentication and key agreement functions. In addition, the proposed protocol is more efficient than other protocols, so it can be applied to practical IoT environments.",

One challenging step for this type of study is collecting groundwater data from different sites and securely sending it to the nearby edges without exposure to hacking and data tampering. In the current paper, we send raw data formats from the Internet of Things to the Distributed Data Storage (DDS) and Blockchain (BC) edges. We use a distributed and decentralized architecture to store the statistics, perform double hashing, and implement access control through smart contracts.

The architecture entails a low power implementation with minimal delay overhead and the performance of proposed RCA based S-Box in terms of security is evaluated using the cryptographic properties such as nonlinearity, correlation immunity bias, strict avalanche criteria, entropy and also found that the proposed architecture is secure enough for cryptographic applications. Moreover, the proposed AES algorithm architecture simulation studies show that energy consumption of 68.726 nJ, power dissipation of 3.856 mW for 0.18- μm at 13.69 MHz and energy consumption of 29.408 nJ, power dissipation of 1.65 mW for 0.13- μm at 13.69 MHz. The proposed AES algorithm with RCA based S-Box shows a reduction power consumption by 50 % and energy consumption by 5 % compared to best classical S-Box and composite field arithmetic based AES algorithm. Apart from that, it is also shown that RCA based S-Boxes are dynamic in nature, invertible, low power dissipation compared to that of LUT based S-Box and hence suitable for Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications.",

    "abstract": "Preserving the privacy of electronic medical records (EMRs) is extremely important especially when medical systems adopt cloud services to store patients' electronic medical records. Considering both the privacy and the utilization of EMRs, some medical systems apply searchable encryption to encrypt EMRs and enable authorized users to search over these encrypted records. Since individuals would like to share their EMRs with multiple persons, how to design an efficient searchable encryption for sharable EMRs is still a very challenge work. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient secure channel free searchable encryption (SCF-PEKS) scheme for sharable EMRs. Comparing with existing SCF-PEKS solutions, our scheme reduces the storage overhead and achieves better computation performance. Moreover, our scheme can guard against keyword guessing attack, which is neglected by most of the existing schemes. Finally, we implement both our scheme and a latest medical-based scheme to evaluate the performance. The evaluation results show that our scheme performs much better performance than the latest one for sharable EMRs.",

This paper presents multiple watermarking schemes for a healthcare information management system for 3D medical image data for the protection, authentication, indexing, and hiding of diagnosis information. The proposed scheme, which is based on POCS watermarking, embeds a robust watermark for a doctor's digital signature and an information retrieval indexing key to the distribution of vertex curvedness; the scheme also embeds a fragile watermark for diagnosis information and an authentication reference message to the vertex distance difference. The multiple embedding process creates three convex sets for robustness, fragileness, and invisibility and projects the 3D medical image data onto these three convex sets alternately and iteratively. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed scheme has the robustness and fragileness to handle various 3D geometric and mesh modifiers simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "A mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled blockchain system is proposed in this study for secure data storage and sharing in internet of things (IoT) networks, with the MEC acting as an overlay system to provide dynamic computation offloading services. Considering latency-critical, resource-limited, and dynamic IoT scenarios, an adaptive system resource allocation and computation offloading scheme is designed to optimize the scalability performance for MEC-enabled blockchain systems, wherein the scalability is quantified as MEC computational efficiency and blockchain system throughput. Specifically, we jointly optimize the computation offloading policy and block generation strategy to maximize the scalability of MEC-enabled blockchain systems and meanwhile guarantee data security and system efficiency. In contrast to existing works that ignore frequent user movement and dynamic task requirements in IoT networks, the joint performance optimization scheme is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, we design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm to solve the MDP problem and define the multiple and variable number of consecutive time slots as a decision epoch to conduct model training. Specifically, DDPG can solve an MDP problem with a continuous action space and it only requires a straightforward actor-critic architecture, making it suitable for tackling the dynamics and complexity of the MEC-enabled blockchain system. As demonstrated by simulations, the proposed scheme can achieve performance improvements over the deep Q network (DQN)-based scheme and some other greedy schemes in terms of long-term transactional throughput.",

The electronic health record (EHR) is an electronic record for patient health information that has alleviated many of the traditional issues associated with paper-based records. However, in the current era of the internet and with the variability of EHR systems, privacy, security, and interoperability remain challenges of the current patient health information management systems. Blockchain technologies provide an opportunity to address many of the challenges associated with current EHR systems. In addition, new frameworks have explored the utility of blockchain-based applications in addressing concerns in different medical disciplines such as neurosurgery. This review discusses these applications, including blockchain-based solutions impacting all of medicine, relating to the EHR, and directly relating to neurosurgery. This review also discusses blockchain technology and the related intricacies for appreciating the relevant frameworks, while also highlighting the challenges associated with this technology.",

    "abstract": "A review of patient confidentiality issues was commissioned and its findings published as the Caldicott Report in December 1997. It made 16 recommendations and formulated six principals. To help in remembering these principles the mnemonic FIONA C can be used: Formal justification of purpose; Information transferred only when absolutely necessary; Only the minimum required; Need to know access controls; All to understand their responsibilities; Comply with and understand the law. Since the Caldicott Report in 1997 the following acts have become law. Data Protection Act 1998, Human Rights Act 1998, Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, Audit Commission Act 1998, Terrorism Act 2000, section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 and Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and by 2005 The Freedom of Information Act 2000 will become law and affect the NHS. Consequently it can be seen that the role and responsibility of Caldicott guardians has grown significantly into what is now known as information governance.",

There are multiple competing concerns from the sponsor, patient and principal investigator's perspectives resulting in most clinical trials not meeting recruitment requirements on time. Conducting under-enrolled clinical trials affects the power of conclusive results or causes premature trial termination. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology originally applied in the financial sector. Its features as a peer-to-peer system with publicly audited transactions, data security, and patient privacy are a good fit for the needs of clinical trials recruitment. The \"Smart Contract\" is a programmable self-executing protocol that regulates the blockchain transactions. Given current recruitment challenges, we have proposed a blockchain model containing multiple trial-based contracts for trial management and patient engagement and a master smart contract for automated subject matching, patient recruitment, and trial-based contracts management.",

This paper proposes a robust model that overcomes critical issues related to security, privacy, access control, and ownership transfer of patients' records. The model incorporates data collection to assess clinical needs, followed by deployment-level checks to mitigate network attacks and enhance Quality-of-Service according to scalability demands. A Modified Genetic Algorithm is employed to improve blockchain scalability. The model also introduces mechanisms for ensuring database integrity, mitigating external attacks, and enhancing usability. It further supports platform-level modularization, access control, department-specific configurations, and patient-level confidentiality. The proposed solution outperforms existing systems, particularly in terms of ease of use, deployment delay, deployment complexity, and module-level efficiency, making it a highly suitable option for implementing secure, customized clinic security systems based on Electronic Health Records.",

Efficiency of such searchable encryption in a medical cloud storage system is very crucial as it involves client platforms such as smartphones or tablets that only have constrained computing power and resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient secure-channel free public key encryption with keyword search (SCF-PEKS) scheme that is proven secure in the standard model. We show that our SCF-PEKS scheme is not only secure against chosen keyword and ciphertext attacks (IND-SCF-CKCA), but also secure against keyword guessing attacks (IND-KGA).

    "title": "The privacy protection of the internet of vehicles resource transaction details based on blockchain.",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of Things technology has promoted the popularization of Internet of Vehicles, and its safety and reliability have become the focus of intelligent transportation system research. Vehicle-road collaboration relies on the collaborative computing and storage resources of the vehicle on-board unit (OBU), which are usually limited. When the vehicle in the edge area needs to do computing tasks such as intelligent driving, but its own computing resources are insufficient. Therefore, it needs other computing resources from idle vehicles and road side unit (RSU). This resource sharing can get additional computing resources to complete the task, and can be more convenient to complete the computing task quickly. Most current studies consider this type of resource sharing as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network transaction, aiming to stimulate the enthusiasm of vehicle sharing and optimize the utilization of computing resources in edge areas. However, the traditional blockchain transaction mode exposes serious privacy disclosure risks in vehicle networking resource transactions, including the openness and transparency of user identity, transaction details, and transaction addresses, which poses great challenges to data security. Therefore, this study innovatively proposed a blockchain-based privacy protection scheme for vehicle networking resource transaction details. By introducing committed value protection, zero-knowledge proof technology and constructing temporary transaction addressed mechanism. The scheme realized the comprehensive privacy protection of transaction funds, transaction details and transaction addresses, which could effectively avoid the disclosure of users' sensitive information. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed scheme not only greatly enhanced the privacy protection capability, but also ensured the efficiency and security of transaction verification through zero-knowledge proof, avoiding the direct exposure of private keys. Meanwhile, the experimental verification demonstrates that the scheme not only enhances the level of privacy protection but also does not augment the supplementary processing burden. Furthermore, it is evident that the scheme meets the rigorous requirements for real-time resource transactions in the Internet of Vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Digitization and automation have always had an immense impact on healthcare. It embraces every new and advanced technology. Recently the world has witnessed the prominence of the metaverse which is an emerging technology in digital space. The metaverse has huge potential to provide a plethora of health services seamlessly to patients and medical professionals with an immersive experience. This paper proposes the amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain in the metaverse to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience. Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, namely the doctor's environment, the patient's environment, and the metaverse environment. The doctors and patients interact in a metaverse environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data. The metaverse environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by avatars in the metaverse environment. All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data, i.e., images, speech, text, videos, clinical data, etc., will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain. These data are used for disease prediction and diagnosis by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models. The GradCAM and LIME approaches of XAI provide logical reasoning for the prediction of diseases and ensure trust, explainability, interpretability, and transparency regarding the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Blockchain technology provides data security for patients while enabling transparency, traceability, and immutability regarding their data. These features of blockchain ensure trust among the patients regarding their data. Consequently, this proposed architecture ensures transparency and trust regarding both the diagnosis of diseases and the data security of the patient. We also explored the building block technologies of the metaverse. Furthermore, we also investigated the advantages and challenges of a metaverse in healthcare.",

    "title": "A robust algorithm for authenticated health data access via blockchain and cloud computing.",
    "abstract": "In modern healthcare, providers increasingly use cloud services to store and share electronic medical records. However, traditional cloud hosting, which depends on intermediaries, poses risks to privacy and security, including inadequate control over access, data auditing, and tracking data origins. Additionally, current schemes face significant limitations such as scalability concerns, high computational overhead, practical implementation challenges, and issues with interoperability and data standardization. Unauthorized data access by cloud providers further exacerbates these concerns. Blockchain technology, known for its secure and decentralized nature, offers a solution by enabling secure data auditing in sharing systems. This research integrates blockchain into healthcare for efficient record management. We proposed a blockchain-based method for secure EHR management and integrated Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) for fine-grained access control. The proposed algorithm combines blockchain and smart contracts with a cloud-based healthcare Service Management System (SMS) to ensure secure and accessible EHRs. Smart contracts automate key management, encryption, and decryption processes, enhancing data security and integrity. The blockchain ledger authenticates data transactions, while the cloud provides scalability. The SMS manages access requests, enhancing resource allocation and response times. A dual authentication system confirms patient keys before granting data access, with failed attempts leading to access revocation and incident logging. Our analyses show that this algorithm significantly improves the security and efficiency of health data exchanges. By combining blockchain's decentralized structure with the cloud's scalability, this approach significantly improves EHR security protocols in modern healthcare setting.",

    "title": "Nonfungible Tokens in Cardiovascular Medicine.",
    "abstract": "The integration of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in health care, particularly in cardiovascular medicine, represents a disruptive shift toward enhancing the security and interconnection of electronic health data around the patient. NFTs, unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain network, bind various sources of health data to their owner (the patient) and delineate the access rights for stakeholders (providers, researchers) using smart contracts. Data sources might include electronic medical records from different hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, test centres, and mHealth devices. Accordingly, patients and their providers benefit from seamless visibility of diagnoses, medications, electrocardiograms, imaging, home blood pressure logs, and artificial intelligence-enabled insights from these aggregated data. Rather than being stored on proprietary servers, data are encrypted and stored on decentralized networks with a unified point of access and immutable proof of ownership, making them more robust to theft or tampering. As custodians of their NFTs, patients are incentivized to actively partake in their health monitoring and self-driven research that aligns with their needs using innovative marketplaces that allow them to browse studies, document their informed consent, and monetize their contributions. Furthermore, they are empowered to educate themselves and seek care across siloes in traditional settings or virtual platforms such as the metaverse, where NFTs serve as digital passports. Despite these exciting prospects, adoption within the health care sector remains in its infancy, with ethical and technical limitations still being addressed. In this article we explore the multifaceted applications and key players in the field, and outline use-cases for patient-centred cardiovascular care featuring NFTs.",

    "title": "Secure IIoT Information Reinforcement Model Based on IIoT Information Platform Using Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "Data created at industrial sites through industrial internet of things devices are now being processed automatically or in real-time in the industrial structure, due to the application of artificial intelligence technology to industrial sites. However, the expenses of autonomous or real-time data processing and steady data processing (analysis, prediction, prescription, and implementation) necessitate a new processing method. We propose a blockchain-based industrial internet of things information reinforcement model in this work that may reliably ensure the integrity of industrial internet of things data produced at industrial locations. The proposed model processes industrial internet of things data that may occur at endpoints at industrial sites into the blockchain by processing data generated by the same industrial internet of things device independently. As a result, the IIoT data sent to the industrial internet of things server can be evaluated more readily, and production accuracy may be enhanced. The proposed model optimizes industrial internet of things information linkage by stochastically reflecting the information based on attribute value frequency. By dynamically aggregating the related data of industrial internet of things information acquired as a seed through hierarchical subnets, the proposed model increases stability and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed model may be used to enhance an organizations' operational efficiency (consulting and training, for example) and strategic decision-making by utilizing fundamental knowledge about items produced at industrial locations. Furthermore, the proposed model allows for information sharing and system connectivity between industrial locations, allowing for close collaboration between industrial internet of things features. As a result of the performance evaluation, the proposed model included an industrial internet of things sensor to the blockchain, eliminating the need for an extra function in the manufacturing process and reducing the time required to validate the integrity of industrial internet of things data. In addition, as a result of analyzing industrial internet of things data by an algorithm according to the number of simulated clouds, the accuracy of industrial internet of things information was improved by 2.5% to 3%, on average.",

    "abstract": "The increased application of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, has fueled concerns regarding the security and privacy of patient data. Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithms can be seen as a potential solution to address this concern. Due to the high variation of LWC, the primary objective of this study was to identify a suitable yet effective algorithm for securing sensitive patient information on IoT devices. This study evaluates the performance of eight LWC algorithms-AES, PRESENT, MSEA, LEA, XTEA, SIMON, PRINCE, and RECTANGLE-using machine learning models. Experiments were conducted on a Raspberry Pi 3 microcontroller using 16 KB to 2048 KB files. Machine learning models were trained and tested for each LWC algorithm and their performance was evaluated based using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. The study analyzed the encryption/decryption execution time, energy consumption, memory usage, and throughput of eight LWC algorithms. The RECTANGLE algorithm was identified as the most suitable and efficient LWC algorithm for IoT in healthcare due to its speed, efficiency, simplicity, and flexibility. This research addresses security and privacy concerns in IoT healthcare and identifies key performance factors of LWC algorithms utilizing the SLR research methodology. Furthermore, the study provides insights into the optimal choice of LWC algorithm for enhancing privacy and security in IoT healthcare environments.",

However, existing network defense technologies do not have the ability to entirely block the penetration behavior of intruders. Therefore, the network needs additional defenses. In this paper, a decoy chain deployment (DCD) method based on SDN+NFV is proposed to address this problem. This method considers about the security status of networks, and deploys decoy chains with the resource constraints. DCD changes the attack surface of the network and makes it difficult for intruders to discern the current state of the network. Simulation experiments and analyses show that DCD can effectively resist penetration attacks by increasing the time cost and complexity of a penetration attack.",

    "abstract": "Medical health records comprise sensitive patient data for precise diagnosis and successive treatment. However, it must be stored and shared securely to protect data privacy. Generally, health records are kept on centralized servers, which raise the risk of security breaches and involve trust in a single authority that cannot efficiently defend data from internal attacks. Blockchain (BC) is extensively used in medical health records management because of its decentralized and tamper-proof properties. This work introduces a public-permissioned BC technology with a decentralized ledger (DL) to manage medical health records in the fog computing layer. The considered BC is decentralized and allows the transmission of records within the decentralized network of records. The data blocks are hashed using the SHA-256 hash algorithm. Especially, an Adaptive RSA Digital Signature Algorithm (ARSA-DS) is developed to prevent data tampering with medical health records in the fog computing layer. Moreover, an Ebola Search Optimization based Key Selection (ESO-KS) technique is employed to find the ideal key from the randomly generated keys to reduce processing time and increase overall efficiency. The proposed decentralized BC framework will help to preserve patient privacy and prevent the tampering of health records by attacks; moreover, it is efficient in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",

This situation creates a constant need for novel, realistic cybersecurity datasets. This paper introduces the effects of using machine-learning-based intrusion detection methods in network traffic coming from a real-life architecture. The main contribution of this work is a dataset coming from a real-world, academic network. Real-life traffic was collected and, after performing a series of attacks, a dataset was assembled. The dataset contains 44 network features and an unbalanced distribution of classes. In this work, the capability of the dataset for formulating machine-learning-based models was experimentally evaluated. To investigate the stability of the obtained models, cross-validation was performed, and an array of detection metrics were reported. The gathered dataset is part of an effort to bring security against novel cyberthreats and was completed in the SIMARGL project.",

    "abstract": "Organizations make use of important information in day-to-day business. Protecting sensitive information is imperative and must be managed. Companies in many parts of the world protect sensitive information using the international standard known as the information security management system (ISMS). ISO 27000 series is the international standard ISMS used to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. While an ISMS based on ISO 27000 series has no particular flaws for general information systems, it is unfit to manage sensitive information for industrial control systems (ICSs) because the first priority of industrial control is safety of the system. Therefore, a new information security management system based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability as well as safety is required for ICSs. This new ISMS must be mutually exclusive of an ICS. This paper provides a new paradigm of ISMS for ICSs, which will be shown to be more suitable than the existing ISMS.",

Such a threat is inspired by Locard's exchange principle, which states (in its digital form) that every interaction with a system must ultimately leave some trace, and as a result, such trace could carry with it sensitive information that subsequent interactions may obtain without authorisation. Therefore, we attempt in this paper to define a subsequent users analysis that calculates this potential loss in data security based on data visibility and sensitivity values. We outline how such analysis can be used in the real world to enhance decision making process when logging in to a shared computer. We adopt a data-driven approach in defining our analysis and we demonstrate the validity of the analysis over a large open Cybersecurity dataset, which associates users with computers.",

Second, we discussed security strategies to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of cloud computing information, focuses on the data encryption technology of cloud data security, and designs and implements the data backup and recovery system based on the cloud platform. The core layers of the system are the system layer and data operation layer. The system uses multithreading technology based on epoll and thread pool to improve the efficiency of data transmission. At the same time, the basic visual page is realized, and users can use the page to create a convenient operating system. Finally, the system is built in the laboratory environment and tested as a whole. The test results show that through the performance comparison with the current commonly used systems, it is found that the system in this paper has a certain improvement in data transmission rate, but the utilization rate of node CPU is as high as 40%, which leads to certain requirements for node CPU performance. Therefore, the system meets the functional requirements proposed in the design. Compared to the existing system, its performance has been found to meet the actual requirements of use, proving that the system is accessible and efficient.",

Experience and feedback have often been claimed to be effective in helping people make better decisions. In a large field experiment involving more than 10,000 employees of a Dutch ministry, we tested the effect of information provision, simulated experience, and their combination to reduce the risks of falling into a phishing attack. Both approaches substantially reduced the proportion of employees giving away their password. Combining both interventions did not have a larger impact.",

In the network, malicious nodes obstruct the performance of the network. The network can be vulnerable by Sybil attack. When a node illicitly assertions multiple identities or claims fake IDs, the WSN grieves from an attack named Sybil attack. This attack threatens wireless sensor network in data aggregation, synchronizing system, routing, fair resource allocation and misbehavior detection. Henceforth, the research is carried out to prevent the Sybil attack and increase the performance of the network. This paper presents the novel security mechanism and Fujisaki Okamoto algorithm and also application of the work. The Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) algorithm is ID based cryptographic scheme and gives strong authentication against Sybil attack. By using Network simulator2 (NS2) the scheme is simulated. In this proposed scheme broadcasting key, time taken for different key sizes, energy consumption, Packet delivery ratio, Throughput were analyzed.",

Recording of information in any such system, in response to a healthcare event, triggers the generation of an Encrypted Token, containing summary metadata about the event, clinical coding indicating its clinical context and a locator that can be used to retrieve the full record of the event from the original Source System. The Valkyrie architecture consists of a number of interlinked Security Domains, each with its own private and public keys, through which the Encrypted Tokens are passed. Each Security Domain performs a specific function on a set of Tokens and only has access to the information within each Token that is necessary to perform that function. This paper describes the structure of the Encrypted Token, the function of each Security Domain and the orchestration of the flow of Tokens through the Domains. Together this allows a user to run a Valkyrie Session, in which they can view the content of a patient record, where all content has been drawn in real-time from heterogenous Source Systems (ISO13606- and openEHR-based) and is destroyed when the session terminates.",

    "title": "Tamper detection and recovery for medical images using near-lossless information hiding technique.",
    "abstract": "Digital medical images are very easy to be modified for illegal purposes. For example, microcalcification in mammography is an important diagnostic clue, and it can be wiped off intentionally for insurance purposes or added intentionally into a normal mammography. In this paper, we proposed two methods to tamper detection and recovery for a medical image. A 1024 x 1024 x-ray mammogram was chosen to test the ability of tamper detection and recovery. At first, a medical image is divided into several blocks. For each block, an adaptive robust digital watermarking method combined with the modulo operation is used to hide both the authentication message and the recovery information. In the first method, each block is embedded with the authentication message and the recovery information of other blocks. Because the recovered block is too small and excessively compressed, the concept of region of interest (ROI) is introduced into the second method. If there are no tampered blocks, the original image can be obtained with only the stego image. When the ROI, such as microcalcification in mammography, is tampered with, an approximate image will be obtained from other blocks. From the experimental results, the proposed near-lossless method is proven to effectively detect a tampered medical image and recover the original ROI image. In this study, an adaptive robust digital watermarking method combined with the operation of modulo 256 was chosen to achieve information hiding and image authentication. With the proposal method, any random changes on the stego image will be detected in high probability.",

    "title": "A Temporal Credential-Based Mutual Authentication with Multiple-Password Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks.",
    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which consist of a large number of sensor nodes, have become among the most important technologies in numerous fields, such as environmental monitoring, military surveillance, control systems in nuclear reactors, vehicle safety systems, and medical monitoring. The most serious drawback for the widespread application of WSNs is the lack of security. Given the resource limitation of WSNs, traditional security schemes are unsuitable. Approaches toward withstanding related attacks with small overhead have thus recently been studied by many researchers. Numerous studies have focused on the authentication scheme for WSNs, but most of these works cannot achieve the security performance and overhead perfectly. Nam et al. proposed a two-factor authentication scheme with lightweight sensor computation for WSNs. In this paper, we review this scheme, emphasize its drawbacks, and propose a temporal credential-based mutual authentication with a multiple-password scheme for WSNs. Our scheme uses multiple passwords to achieve three-factor security performance and generate a session key between user and sensor nodes. The security analysis phase shows that our scheme can withstand related attacks, including a lost password threat, and the comparison phase shows that our scheme involves a relatively small overhead. In the comparison of the overhead phase, the result indicates that more than 95% of the overhead is composed of communication and not computation overhead. Therefore, the result motivates us to pay further attention to communication overhead than computation overhead in future research.",

Business resilience entails the integration of different areas of expertise in a joint effort to secure the future of an organisation in a dynamic environment. It requires the right balance of risk management, information security and data protection, business continuity management and crisis management. To ensure that each area of expertise can operate independently within a coordinated framework, the right structure is essential. Much like a carpenter needs a hammer, the business resilience manager requires the right tools. Attention must be paid to collaboration, information sharing and balancing the right level of integration. While the tooling process will not be a panacea for the various challenges facing the business resilience manager, it will, however, be an enabler: it is beneficial, has deliverables and supports management and control.",

    "title": "The fall and rise of cancer registration in Estonia: The dangers of overzealous application of data protection.",
    "abstract": "The population-based Estonian Cancer Registry (ECR) has maintained a database of cancer cases since 1968. Between 2001 and 2007 the ECR was prohibited from linking cancer records to death certificates. In January 2008, the prohibition was lifted, and two years later the ECR was able to begin tracing back unmatched deaths. This paper estimates the effect of the linkage ban on reported cancer incidence and survival. Incident cancers in 2001-2007 were extracted from the ECR database in May 2018 to allow for late registrations. Two datasets were created: one with all incident cases and another without death-certificate-initiated (DCI) cases. Using both datasets, age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR) and their ratios; age-standardised five-year relative survival ratios (ARSR) and excess mortality rate ratios were calculated. In 2001-2007, 46,535 incident cancers were registered in the ECR. Of them, 2299 (4.9 %) were DCI cases. The inclusion of DCI cases increased the ASIR for overall cancer by 6 % in men and 3 % in women. An increase ≥10 % in ASIR for lung, liver and pancreatic cancer was observed. The effect of accrued DCI cases to the ARSR was minor. Excess mortality in the dataset without DCI cases was 4 % underestimated in men and 3 % in women. Biases in cancer incidence and survival measures generated by the temporary record linkage ban were largely correctable by using trace-back procedures when this became possible. Nevertheless, this type of ban and the arguments put forward to justify it, harm disease registration and register-based research.",

Originally proposed as part of the Bitcoin distributed stack, it can be applied in a number of fields, most notably in smart contracts, social media, secure IoT, and cryptocurrency mining. It ensures data integrity by distributing strongly encrypted data in widely redundant segments. Each new insertion requires verification and approval by the majority of the users of the blockchain. Both encryption and verification are computationally intensive tasks which cannot be solved with ordinary off-the-shelf CPUs. This has resulted in a renewed scientific interest in secure distributed communication and coordination protocols. Mobile health applications are growing progressively popular and have the enormous advantage of timely diagnosis of certain conditions. However, privacy concerns have been raised as mobile health applications by default have access to highly sensitive personal data.

    "abstract": "In view of various security requirements, there are various security services in the network. In particular, DDoS attacks have various types and detection methods. How to flexibly combine security services and make full use of the information provided by security services have become urgent problems to be solved. This paper combines the reasoning ability of the malicious behavior knowledge base to realize the dynamic deployment of the service function chain and dynamic configuration of the security service function. The method feeds back the information generated by the security service to the knowledge base. After the analysis of the knowledge base, the service function chain path and the security service configuration policies are generated, and these policies will be dynamically distributed to the security service function. Finally, security services can be dynamically arranged for different network traffic, realizing the coordinated use of various security services and improving the overall detection rate of the network. The experimental results show that by arranging the paths under the UDP and the TCP, the overall detection rate of the network can reach 99% and 88%, respectively, indicating that it has a good overall detection performance for multiple distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.",

They claimed that their scheme can resist several types of attacks. However, through careful analysis, we find that Li et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to stolen smart card and off-line dictionary attacks, replay attacks, impersonation attacks and server spoofing attacks. By analyzing other similar schemes, we find that a certain type of dynamic ID-based multi-server authentication scheme in which only hash functions are used and whereby no registration center participates in the authentication and session key agreement phase faces difficulties in providing perfectly efficient and secure authentication. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a novel dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments based on pairing and self-certified public keys. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme is secure against various attacks and has many excellent features.",

    "abstract": "Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75% were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33% with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17% were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5% with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.",

    "abstract": "Smart devices have accentuated the importance of geolocation information. Geolocation identification using smart devices has paved the path for incentive-based location-based services (LBS). However, a user's full control over a smart device can allow tampering of the location proof. Witness-oriented location proof systems (LPS) have emerged to resist the generation of false proofs and mitigate collusion attacks. However, witness-oriented LPS are still susceptible to three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location authority, and the witness). To overcome the threat of three-way collusion in existing schemes, we introduce a decentralized consensus protocol called MobChain in this paper. In this scheme the selection of a witness and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of nodes in an underlying P2P network that establishes a private blockchain. The persistent provenance data over the blockchain provides strong security guarantees; as a result, the forging and manipulation of location becomes impractical. MobChain provides secure location provenance architecture, relying on decentralized decision making for the selection of participants of the protocol thereby addressing the three-way collusion problem. Our prototype implementation and comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions show that MobChain is computationally efficient and highly available while improving the security of LPS.",

    "title": "An image encryption algorithm utilizing julia sets and hilbert curves.",
    "abstract": "Image encryption is an important and effective technique to protect image security. In this paper, a novel image encryption algorithm combining Julia sets and Hilbert curves is proposed. The algorithm utilizes Julia sets' parameters to generate a random sequence as the initial keys and gets the final encryption keys by scrambling the initial keys through the Hilbert curve. The final cipher image is obtained by modulo arithmetic and diffuse operation. In this method, it needs only a few parameters for the key generation, which greatly reduces the storage space. Moreover, because of the Julia sets' properties, such as infiniteness and chaotic characteristics, the keys have high sensitivity even to a tiny perturbation. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm has large key space, good statistical property, high sensitivity for the keys, and effective resistance to the chosen-plaintext attack.",

    "title": "Protecting Biomedical Data Against Attribute Disclosure.",
    "abstract": "Modern medical research requires access to patient-level data of significant detail and volume. In this context, privacy concerns and legal requirements demand careful consideration. Data anonymization, which means that data is transformed to reduce privacy risks, is an important building block of data protection concepts. However, common methods of data anonymization often fail to protect data against inference of sensitive attribute values (also called attribute disclosure). Measures against such attacks have been developed, but it has been argued that they are of little practical relevance, as they involve significant data transformations which reduce output data utility to an unacceptable degree. In this article, we present an experimental study of the degree of protection and impact on data utility provided by different approaches for protecting biomedical data from attribute disclosure. We quantified the utility and privacy risks of datasets that have been protected using different anonymization methods and parameterizations. We put the results into relation with trivial baseline approaches, visualized them in the form of risk-utility curves and analyzed basic statistical properties of the sensitive attributes (e.g. the skewness of their distribution). Our results confirm that it is difficult to protect data from attribute disclosure, but they also indicate that it can be possible to achieve reasonable degrees of protection when appropriate methods are chosen based on data characteristics. While it is hard to give general recommendations, the approach presented in this article and the tools that we have used can be helpful for deciding how a given dataset can best be protected in a specific usage scenario.",

    "abstract": "QR code based visual encryption schemes are still relatively rare, and the existing schemes are mainly implemented by averaging grayscale maps. They become distorted when recovering complex secret images. In this paper, we propose a visual cryptography scheme based on QR codes. We use two adaptive schemes to improve the distortion problem in secret image recovery. The algorithm for generating the QR code shared matrix is improved, and the secret image can be restored quickly. This scheme could ensure the uniform distribution of secret vectors. Meanwhile individual shared QR codes would never reveal any secret information. The proposed algorithm reduces the space consumed by the secret vector and the probability of falling prey to illegal attacks. Compared with other schemes, the secret image recovered via the proposed method is clearer and the scheme is suitable for scenarios in which the secret images are more complex, as it yields better security and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution promises unconditionally secure communications. However, as practical devices tend to deviate from their specifications, the security of some practical systems is no longer valid. In particular, an adversary can exploit imperfect detectors to learn a large part of the secret key, even though the security proof claims otherwise. Recently, a practical approach--measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution--has been proposed to solve this problem. However, so far its security has only been fully proven under the assumption that the legitimate users of the system have unlimited resources. Here we fill this gap and provide a rigorous security proof against general attacks in the finite-key regime. This is obtained by applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound, to perform parameter estimation. For the first time we demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance implementations of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution within a reasonable time frame of signal transmission.",

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication is the process of recognizing a person by means of his\\her psychological or behavioral traits. One of the most important issues faced by the biometric system developer is to protect the template obtained from the biometric of a person. Unimodal biometric system has some drawbacks such as noisy data, interclass variations and spoof attack. Multimodal biometric system has been developed to address the boundaries of unimodal biometric system and increase the security of template. In this paper, template security analysis of multimodal biometric system based of fingerprint and palmprint is proposed and implemented. Fuzzy vault scheme is employed to protect both the fingerprint and palmprint template. At enrollment, image processing techniques such as image enhancement, segmentation and bottom-hat filtering are applied on both the biometric to improve the quality and subsequently the most important features are extracted. Extracted features are concatenated. Combined features along with secret key are utilized to generate the database in the vault. During authentication, query images are sent as an input with the stored template to recover the key. Experimental results are shown that the proposed multi biometrics system performs well than the other methods considered for comparison.",

    "abstract": "The scale of wireless sensor networks changes depending on specific application tasks. How to design a relatively simple security mechanism that can extend with the expansion of network scale is an arduous task. As the wireless sensor network mostly adopts the decentralized organization form, once the network nodes are distributed adequately, it is difficult to find out the failure of any node. In addition, the node has weak resistance to physical damage, so any node in the network may potentially become a cause of security vulnerability. In this study, firstly, the security standards that wireless sensor networks should have and the current security challenges faced by the network are discussed in detail, and the importance of security issues in wireless sensor networks is pointed out. Secondly, this paper studies and analyzes the current situation of wireless sensor network security problems including the internal and external attacks and the active and passive attacks. Thirdly, this paper also discusses the significance, concept, and characteristics of reputation and trust, the division and composition of reputation and trust system, and the common applications of the reputation and trust mechanism in wireless sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "As the popularity of wearable and the implantable body sensor network (BSN) devices increases, there is a growing concern regarding the data security of such power-constrained miniaturized medical devices. With limited computational power, BSN devices are often not able to provide strong security mechanisms to protect sensitive personal and health information, such as one's physiological data. Consequently, many new methods of securing wireless body area networks have been proposed recently. One effective solution is the biometric cryptosystem (BCS) approach. BCS exploits physiological and behavioral biometric traits, including face, iris, fingerprints, electrocardiogram, and photoplethysmography. In this paper, we propose a new BCS approach for securing wireless communications for wearable and implantable healthcare devices using gait signal energy variations and an artificial neural network framework. By simultaneously extracting similar features from BSN sensors using our approach, binary keys can be generated on demand without user intervention. Through an extensive analysis on our BCS approach using a gait dataset, the results have shown that the binary keys generated using our approach have high entropy for all subjects. The keys can pass both National Institute of Standards and Technology and Dieharder statistical tests with high efficiency. The experimental results also show the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of the similarity of intraclass keys and the discriminability of the interclass keys.",

    "title": "Novel model to authenticate role-based medical users for blockchain-based IoMT devices.",
    "abstract": "The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization.",

In addition to using these IT-enabled applications for business purposes, we also use WhatsApp, Facebook, and a variety of other IT applications to communicate with others. However, there will undoubtedly be a drawback to every benefit. Since everything is linked to the Internet, there are many opportunities for security to be compromised. To address this, we are working to identify security threats early on in the software development process, specifically during the requirements phase. During the requirement engineering process, an engineer can recognize the security specifications in a more structured manner to create threat-free software. In our research work, we suggest the Identification of Security Threats during Requirement Engineering (ISTDRE) technique for detecting security risks throughout the requirement engineering process. The four points that make up this ISTDRE technique are Hack Point (HP), Speculation Point (SP), Trust Point (TP), and Reliable Point (RP). The new ISTDRE methodology will be validated using a case study of an ERP system involving two currently used methodologies: Model Oriented Security Requirements Engineering (MOSRE) and System Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE).",

    "title": "Memory Visualization-Based Malware Detection Technique.",
    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threat is an attack campaign in which an intruder or team of intruders establishes a long-term presence on a network to mine sensitive data, which becomes more dangerous when combined with polymorphic malware. This type of malware is not only undetectable, but it also generates multiple variants of the same type of malware in the network and remains in the system's main memory to avoid detection. Few researchers employ a visualization approach based on a computer's memory to detect and classify various classes of malware. However, a preprocessing step of denoising the malware images was not considered, which results in an overfitting problem and prevents us from perfectly generalizing a model. In this paper, we introduce a new data engineering approach comprising two main stages: Denoising and Re-Dimensioning. The first aims at reducing or ideally removing the noise in the malware's memory-based dump files' transformed images. The latter further processes the cleaned image by compressing them to reduce their dimensionality. This is to avoid the overfitting issue and lower the variance, computing cost, and memory utilization. We then built our machine learning model that implements the new data engineering approach and the result shows that the performance metrics of 97.82% for accuracy, 97.66% for precision, 97.25% for recall, and 97.57% for f1-score are obtained. Our new data engineering approach and machine learning model outperform existing solutions by 0.83% accuracy, 0.30% precision, 1.67% recall, and 1.25% f1-score. In addition to that, the computational time and memory usage have also reduced significantly.",

This study aims to measure the effectiveness of security practices at small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia in the event of a cybersecurity attack. Our paper is among the first research papers to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity practices and the threat posed by cybersecurity breaches among small enterprises in the event of cybersecurity attacks. A total of 282 respondents participated, all of them representing small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia. The study applies multiple regression tests to analyze the effectiveness of 12 cybersecurity practices in three aspects: financial damage, loss of sensitive data, and restoration time, at small enterprises. The findings indicate that having an inspection team and a recovery plan may limit the financial damage caused by cybersecurity attacks on small enterprises. The results also show that cybersecurity awareness, knowledge of cybersecurity damage, and professionals' salaries were related to the loss of sensitive data. Furthermore, the results indicate that contact with cybersecurity authorities and having an inspection team have statistically significant effects on restoration time.",

Most healthcare applications that use the Internet have at least implemented some kind of encryption. Most applications also enforce user authentication and access control policies, and many audit user actions. However, most fall short on providing strong assurances that the security mechanisms are behaving as expected and that they cannot be subverted. While no system can claim to be totally \"bulletproof,\" PCASSO provides assurance of correct operation through formal, disciplined design and development methodologies, as well as through functional and penetration testing. Through its security mechanisms, backed by strong system assurances, PCASSO is demonstrating \"safe\" use of public data networks for health care.",

We begin by reviewing three concepts necessary to any discussion about data security in a healthcare environment: privacy, confidentiality, and consent. We are giving some advice on how to protect local data. Authentication and privacy of e-mail via encryption is offered by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). The de facto Internet standard for encrypting Web-based information interchanges is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), more recently known as Transport Layer Security or TLS. There is a public key infrastructure process to 'sign' a message whereby the private key of an individual can be used to 'hash' the message. This can then be verified against the sender's public key. This ensures the data's authenticity and origin without conferring privacy, and is called a 'digital signature'. The best protection against viruses is not opening e-mails from unknown sources or those containing unusual message headers.",

They are endowed with the ability to meet the bandwidth requirement of those applications that require intensive bandwidth. There are more domains opening up in the OBS that evidently shows their advantages and their capability to face the future network traffic. However, the concept of OBS is still far from perfection facing issues in case of security threat. The transfer of optical switching paradigm to optical burst switching faces serious downfall in the fields of burst aggregation, routing, authentication, dispute resolution, and quality of service (QoS). This paper deals with employing RC4 (stream cipher) to encrypt and decrypt bursts thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the burst. Although the use of AES algorithm has already been proposed for the same issue, by contrasting the two algorithms under the parameters of burst encryption and decryption time, end-to-end delay, it was found that RC4 provided better results. This paper looks to provide a better solution for the confidentiality of the burst in OBS networks.",

    "title": "Security and privacy requirements for a multi-institutional cancer research data grid: an interview-based study.",
    "abstract": "Data protection is important for all information systems that deal with human-subjects data. Grid-based systems--such as the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG)--seek to develop new mechanisms to facilitate real-time federation of cancer-relevant data sources, including sources protected under a variety of regulatory laws, such as HIPAA and 21CFR11. These systems embody new models for data sharing, and hence pose new challenges to the regulatory community, and to those who would develop or adopt them. These challenges must be understood by both systems developers and system adopters. In this paper, we describe our work collecting policy statements, expectations, and requirements from regulatory decision makers at academic cancer centers in the United States. We use these statements to examine fundamental assumptions regarding data sharing using data federations and grid computing. An interview-based study of key stakeholders from a sample of US cancer centers. Interviews were structured, and used an instrument that was developed for the purpose of this study. The instrument included a set of problem scenarios--difficult policy situations that were derived during a full-day discussion of potentially problematic issues by a set of project participants with diverse expertise. Each problem scenario included a set of open-ended questions that were designed to elucidate stakeholder opinions and concerns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, data was aggregated at the individual or institutional unit of analysis, depending on the specific interview question. Thirty-one (31) individuals at six cancer centers were contacted to participate. Twenty-four out of thirty-one (24/31) individuals responded to our request- yielding a total response rate of 77%. Respondents included IRB directors and policy-makers, privacy and security officers, directors of offices of research, information security officers and university legal counsel. Nineteen total interviews were conducted over a period of 16 weeks. Respondents provided answers for all four scenarios (a total of 87 questions). Results were grouped by broad themes, including among others: governance, legal and financial issues, partnership agreements, de-identification, institutional technical infrastructure for security and privacy protection, training, risk management, auditing, IRB issues, and patient/subject consent. The findings suggest that with additional work, large scale federated sharing of data within a regulated environment is possible. A key challenge is developing suitable models for authentication and authorization practices within a federated environment. Authentication--the recognition and validation of a person's identity--is in fact a global property of such systems, while authorization - the permission to access data or resources--mimics data sharing agreements in being best served at a local level. Nine specific recommendations result from the work and are discussed in detail. These include: (1) the necessity to construct separate legal or corporate entities for governance of federated sharing initiatives on this scale; (2) consensus on the treatment of foreign and commercial partnerships; (3) the development of risk models and risk management processes; (4) development of technical infrastructure to support the credentialing process associated with research including human subjects; (5) exploring the feasibility of developing large-scale, federated honest broker approaches; (6) the development of suitable, federated identity provisioning processes to support federated authentication and authorization; (7) community development of requisite HIPAA and research ethics training modules by federation members; (8) the recognition of the need for central auditing requirements and authority, and; (9) use of two-protocol data exchange models where possible in the federation.",

    "abstract": "Using the metaphor and actuality of the 'everyday cyborg', this article makes the case that the law is ill-equipped to deal with challenges raised by the linking of the organic, biological person with synthetic, inorganic parts and devices. For instance, should internal medical devices that keep the person alive be viewed as part of the person or mere objects (or something else)? Is damage to neuro-prostheses (eg nervous system integrated limb prostheses) personal injury or damage to property? Who ought to control/own the software in implanted medical devices? And how should the law deal with risks around third-party device access (including that of unauthorised access and hacking)? We argue that satisfactorily answering such questions will likely require a re-analysis of the conceptual and philosophical underpinnings of the law, as well as the law itself. To demonstrate this, we examine the uncharted terrain which everyday cyborgs pose for the law, looking in particular at five areas: (i) medical device regulation, safety, and product liability; (ii) damage to devices and liability; (iii) data and privacy; (iv) security and biohacking; and (v) intellectual property rights. The article highlights how advancing biotechnology continues to reveal, and prompts us to confront, lacunae within the law. Our analysis calls particular attention to law's boundary-work (how the law utilises and incorporates supposed ontological and moral boundaries) and the challenges which everyday cyborgs pose to this.",

    "abstract": "A smart grid, considered the next-generation type of power grid, combines a traditional power grid with information and communication technologies to effectively facilitate power generation and ensure transmission security and reliability in real-time. Only authorized consumers should be able to access the smart grid because the information gathered by smart meters includes users' private information. However, smart grid security is still a challenge. Motivated by this challenge, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous signcryption (HSC) scheme for secure communication between smart meters and the utility. We demonstrate that this scheme is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) and ciphertext-anonymous against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (ANON-CCA2) under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and ciphertext anonymity in a single logical step. It supports heterogeneous systems, allowing a meter in an identity-based cryptography (IBC) environment to transmit electrical usage data to a utility in a public key infrastructure (PKI) environment. Compared with other existing related schemes, our scheme has the lowest communication overhead and energy consumption for the smart grid. Based on these features, our scheme is highly suitable for secure power transmissions in a smart grid.",

    "title": "Secure web messaging in a pediatric chronic care clinic: a slow takeoff of \"kids' airmail\".",
    "abstract": "Although e-mail may be an efficient clinician-patient communication tool, standard e-mail is not adequately secure to meet Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. For this reason, firewall-secured electronic messaging systems have been developed for use in health care. Impact and usability of these secure systems have not been broadly assessed. To evaluate the impact of a secure electronic messaging system implemented for a pediatric subspecialty clinic. This study was performed in an outpatient, academic pediatric respiratory clinic in spring 2009 in New Haven, Connecticut. Patients were surveyed prior to implementation regarding internet usage. The Kryptiq messaging system was implemented and messages were monitored continuously and tracked. Open-ended qualitative interviews with 28 users and nonusers were conducted, and we described the process of implementation. All of the 127 patients/families surveyed expressed interest in using the Internet to contact their clinic providers, and they all reported having the ability to access the Internet. In the 8 months after implementation, only 5 messages were initiated by patients in contrast to 2363 phone calls. Themes emerged from the open-ended interviews that indicated promoters, barriers, and potential uses. Prominent barriers included the lack of convenience and personal touch and being technically difficult to use. Although these patients/families expressed strong interest in e-mailing, secure Web messaging was less convenient than using the phone, too technically cumbersome, lacked a personal touch, and was used only by a handful of patients.",

    "abstract": "Dental students must be skilled in the use and application of information technology (IT), but there are few studies of IT use and knowledge among U.S. dental students. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze survey data regarding IT use and knowledge collected from first-year dental students at one U.S. dental school in 2009, 2012, and 2017. Data were collected from an anonymous survey of these students as part of a D1 course called Informatics and Evaluation of Dental Literature. All students participated in the survey each year, for a response rate of 100%. Annual numbers of participants were 80 (2009), 90 (2012), and 97 (2017), for a total 267 respondents. The students reported that they frequently accessed Internet resources multiple times per day and that frequency of use had increased over time, principally from access via smartphones. These students reported feeling comfortable with higher education IT applications such as learning management systems and computerized testing. However, despite their frequent IT use, the students reported low levels of knowledge about IT security, and the three years of survey data showed that IT security knowledge had declined over time. These findings have implications for dental educators, including the need for methods for training students to protect their personal data and that of their patients.",

    "title": "Integrating Visual Mnemonics and Input Feedback With Passphrases to Improve the Usability and Security of Digital Authentication.",
    "abstract": "We developed a new authentication system based on passphrases instead of passwords. Our new system incorporates a user-generated mnemonic picture displayed during login, definition tooltips, error correction to reduce typographical errors, a decoy-based input masking technique, and random passphrase generation using either a specialized wordlist or a sentence template. Passphrases exhibit a greater level of security than traditional passwords, but their wider adoption has been hindered by human factors issues. Our assertion is that the added features of our system work particularly well with passphrases and help address these shortcomings. We conducted a study to evaluate our new system with a customized 1,450-word list and our new system with a 6-word sentence structure against the control conditions of a user-created passphrase of at least 24 characters and a system-generated passphrase using a 10,326-word list. Fifty participants completed two sessions so that we could measure the usability and security of the authentication schemes. With the new system conditions, memorability was improved, and security was equivalent to or better than the control conditions. Usability and overall ratings also favored the new system conditions over the control conditions. Our research presents a new authentication system using innovative techniques that improve on the usability and security of existing password and passphrase authentication systems. In computer security, drastic changes should never happen overnight, but we recommend that our contributions be incorporated into current authentication systems to help facilitate a transition from passwords to usable passphrases.",

To improve the robustness of the system, the protocol has been upgraded by adding some mechanisms such as system feedback.

Through the tests for two different DICOM-e-mail teleradiology application, the validity of the new protocol is proved and at the same time some bugs are found. The implementation of the latest protocol and the general error tests can help to make the whole teleradiology system a better robustness.

Ensuring the security of smart homes is challenging due to the heterogeneity of applications and protocols involved in this environment. This work proposes the FamilyGuard architecture to add a new layer of security and simplify management of the home environment by detecting network traffic anomalies. Experiments are carried out to validate the main components of the architecture. An anomaly detection module is also developed by using machine learning through one-class classifiers based on the network flow. The results show that the proposed solution can offer smart home users additional and personalized security features using low-cost devices.",

    "abstract": "As a typical application of sensor networks, there exist many information security problems in smart parks, such as confusion of personnel access, lack of security management, disorderly data flow, insufficient collection of audit evidence, and so on. Aiming at the scenario of personnel and equipment moving in different areas of smart parks, the paper proposes a joint authorization and dynamic access control mechanism, which can provide unified identity management services, access control services, and policy management services, and effectively solve the problem of multi-authorization in user identity and authority management. The license negotiation interaction protocol is designed to prevent common network attack threats in the process of identity authentication and authority management. In order to realize the tamper-proof storage of personnel and equipment movement trajectory, the paper also designs a movement trajectory traceability protocol based on a Merkle tree, which solves the problems of internal personnel malicious attack, trusted third-party dependency bottleneck, high overheads of tracking algorithms, and so on. The experimental results show that compared with the current security control mechanisms for sensor networks, the joint authorization, and dynamic access control mechanism can support multi-party authorization and traceability, while the overhead it generates in initialization, encryption, decryption, and key generation steps are basically the same as other mechanisms do.",

These technologies are well embedded in the areas of global finance, health care and defence, to name a few. This review focuses on the relevance of blockchain technology to health care. Blockchain technology will be the unifying platform for sharing patient data currently inaccessible due to the siloed architecture of legacy software systems, and as a result potentially be the basis for precision or individualized patient treatment. It will also strengthen digital security of sensitive patient data that is presently a lucrative target for cyber criminals. In the current COVID-19 environment, clinicians will rely more on telehealth to reduce person-to-person contact. This service can be delivered by the clinical team with confidence in the veracity of the patient data made accessible through the blockchain platform. Smart contracts written on the blockchain platform will reduce the possibility of international humanitarian aid to low- and middle-income countries being misspent. The pharmaceutical supply chain industry is adopting blockchain technology to ensure supply chain provenance. Similarly, the health insurance industry recognizes how the blockchain ecosystem can improve services to its members and expedite reimbursements to clinicians.",

In this study, we focused on combining wireless transmission and digital watermarking technologies to better secure the transmission of medical images within and outside the hospital. We utilized an integrated system comprising the wireless network and the digital watermarking module to conduct a series of tests. The test results were evaluated by medical consultants. They concluded that the images suffered no visible quality degradation and maintained their diagnostic integrity. The proposed integrated system presented reasonable stability, and its performance was comparable to that of a fixed network.

Therefore, data security, privacy and user authentication are enormously important for accessing important medical data over insecure communication. Recently, many user authentication protocols for TMIS have been proposed in the literature and it has been observed that most of the protocols cannot achieve complete security requirements. In this paper, we have scrutinized two (Mishra et al., Xu et al.) remote user authentication protocols using smart card and explained that both the protocols are suffering against several security weaknesses. We have then presented three-factor user authentication and key agreement protocol usable for TMIS, which fix the security pitfalls of the above mentioned schemes. The informal cryptanalysis makes certain that the proposed protocol provides well security protection on the relevant security attacks. Furthermore, the simulator AVISPA tool confirms that the protocol is secure against active and passive attacks including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The security functionalities and performance comparison analysis confirm that our protocol not only provide strong protection on security attacks, but it also achieves better complexities along with efficient login and password change phase as well as session key verification property.",

    "abstract": "The study presents a framework to analyze and detect meddling in real-time network data and identify numerous meddling patterns that may be harmful to various communication means, academic institutes, and other industries. The major challenge was to develop a non-faulty framework to detect meddling (to overcome the traditional ways). With the development of machine learning technology, detecting and stopping the meddling process in the early stages is much easier. In this study, the proposed framework uses numerous data collection and processing techniques and machine learning techniques to train the meddling data and detect anomalies. The proposed framework uses support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithms to detect the meddling in a network entangled with blockchain technology to ensure the privacy and protection of models as well as communication data. SVM achieves the highest training detection accuracy (DA) and misclassification rate (MCR) of 99.59% and 0.41%, respectively, and SVM achieves the highest-testing DA and MCR of 99.05% and 0.95%, respectively. The presented framework portrays the best meddling detection results, which are very helpful for various communication and transaction processes.",

    "title": "Hackathons as Stepping Stones in Health Care Innovation: Case Study With Systematic Recommendations.",
    "abstract": "Until recently, developing health technologies was time-consuming and expensive, and often involved patients, doctors, and other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end product. So far, users have been minimally involved in the ideation and creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address users' unmet needs, a transdisciplinary and user-led approach, involving cocreation and direct user feedback, is required. In this context, hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating enthusiasm for user-centered innovation. This case study describes preparatory steps and the performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were assessed, leading to the development of systematic recommendations for future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care. A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin, Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in December 2017 and November 2018 were included. In total, 30 participants took part, with 63% (19/30) of participants between 25 and 34 years of age, 30% (9/30) between 35 and 44 years of age, and 7% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of 43% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of medical experts, including patients and health care professionals, was 30% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a chatbot for skin cancer recognition, an augmented reality exposure-based therapy (eg, for arachnophobia), an app for medical neighborhood connectivity, a doctor appointment platform, and a self-care app for people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n≤30) were developed, including aspects of community building, stakeholder engagement, mentoring, themes, announcements, follow-up, and timing for each step. This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary hackathons.",

    "title": "Is patient confidentiality compromised with the electronic health record?: a position paper.",
    "abstract": "In order for electronic health records to fulfill their expected benefits, protection of privacy of patient information is key. Lack of trust in confidentiality can lead to reluctance in disclosing all relevant information, which could have grave consequences. This position paper contemplates whether patient confidentiality is compromised by electronic health records. The position that confidentiality is compromised was supported by the four bioethical principles and argued that despite laws and various safeguards to protect patients' confidentiality, numerous data breaches have occurred. The position that confidentiality is not compromised was supported by virtue ethics and a utilitarian viewpoint and argued that safeguards keep information confidential and the public feels relatively safe with the electronic health record. The article concludes with an ethically superior position that confidentiality is compromised with the electronic health record. Although organizational and governmental ways of enhancing the confidentiality of patient information within the electronic health record facilitate confidentiality, the ultimate responsibility of maintaining confidentiality rests with the individual end-users and their ethical code of conduct. The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for nurses calls for nurses to be watchful with data security in electronic communications.",

    "abstract": "In order for national statistical offices to maintain the trust of the public to collect data and publish statistics of importance to society and decision-making, it is imperative that respondents (persons or establishments) be guaranteed privacy and confidentiality in return for providing requested confidential data. Consequently, for most survey and census data, disclosure limitation techniques must be applied before the data are ready for public release. For microdata, examples of methods that can be used to identify respondents include directly extracting identifying information from microdata files or indirectly identifying respondents by matching a given file with an external file. For tabular data, respondents may be identified directly from small cell counts or respondent contributions to heavily concentrated cells of magnitude data may be closely approximated by the cell value. Indirect disclosure is possible in tables through manipulation of additive tabular relationships between cell values and totals, e.g. manipulating rows and column totals in a two-dimensional table. Two-dimensional statistical tables are a staple of official statistics. This paper describes a desktop software system that for the first time implements within a single framework four standard disclosure limitation techniques for protecting tabular data in two-dimensional tables: complementary cell suppression, minimum-distance controlled rounding, unbiased controlled rounding, and controlled rounding subject to subtotals constraints, and a fifth, new method: controlled tabular adjustment, and summarizes the five methods.",

    "title": "Healthcare 5.0: A secure and distributed network for system informatics in medical surgery.",
    "abstract": "Health records serve not only as a database of a patient's health history and treatment process but also as a crucial tool for doctors to diagnose and treat patients. However, the storage and sharing of these records are sensitive issues as they involve maintaining patient privacy and ensuring data transparency, security, and interoperability between different parties. Challenges to achieving these goals in the current surgical process can impact the allocation of medical resources and surgical outcomes. This article proposes a healthcare 5.0 framework for medical surgery that deploys a secure and distributed network using Blockchain to demonstrate transactions between different parties in the orthopedic surgery process. The proposed network uses the Hyperledger Composer platform for deployment, and a patient-doctor-supplier orthopedic surgery network is designed and implemented to enable the safe sharing of medical records. A benchmarking tool was implemented for analyzing different scenarios of applying blockchain technology to orthopedic surgery. The application of blockchain technology to orthopedic surgery presents a promising solution for data sharing and supply chain management in the field. The integration of blockchain with cloud storage and hybrid encryption ensures secure and efficient storage of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Personal Health Record (PHR) data. By leveraging the tamper-proof nature of blockchain and addressing concerns regarding centralized data storage, this scenario demonstrates enhanced security, improved access efficiency, and privacy protection in medical data sharing. The article demonstrates the feasibility of using an IoT-based blockchain network in orthopedic surgery, which can reduce medical errors and improve data interoperability among different parties. This unique application of blockchain enables secure sharing of medical records, ensuring transparency, security, and interoperability. The network design may also be applicable to other surgeries and medical applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "The Internet goose has laid countless golden eggs, along with a growing number of rotten ones. But it's the rotten ones that now tempt commercial, governmental, and consumer interests to threaten the Internet's uniquely creative power. The expediently selected, almost accidentally generative properties of the Internet - its technical openness, ease of access and mastery, and adaptability - have combined, especially when coupled with those of the PC, to produce an unsurpassed environment for innovative experiment. Those same properties, however, also make the Internet hospitable to various forms of wickedness: hacking, porn, spam, fraud, theft, predation, and attacks on the network itself. As these undesirable phenomena proliferate, business, government, and many users find common cause for locking down Internet and PC architecture in the interests of security and order. PC and Internet security vulnerabilities are a legitimate menace. However, the most likely reactions - if they are not forestalled - will be at least as unfortunate as the security problems themselves. Consider the growing profusion of \"tethered appliances\" - devices whose functions cannot readily be altered by their owners (think TiVo). Such appliances take Internet innovations and wrap them up in a neat, easy-to-use package, which is good - but only if the Internet and PC can remain sufficiently in the center of the digital ecosystem to produce the next round of innovations and to generate competition. People buy these devices for their convenience or functionality and may appreciate the fact that they are safer to use (they limit the damage users can do through ignorance or carelessness). But the risk is that users, by migrating to such appliances, will unwittingly trade away the future benefits of generativity - a loss that will go unappreciated even as innovation tapers off.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain is a list of records that uses cryptography to make stored data immutable; their use has recently been proposed for electronic medical record (EMR) systems. This paper details a systematic review of trade-offs in blockchain technologies that are relevant to EMRs. Trade-offs are defined as \"a compromise between two desirable but incompatible features.\" This review's primary research question was: \"What are the trade-offs involved in different blockchain designs that are relevant to the creation of blockchain-based electronic medical records systems?\" Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Papers published from January 1, 2017 to June 15, 2018 were selected. Quality assessments of papers were performed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Critical Assessment Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Database searches identified 2885 articles, of which 15 were ultimately included for analysis. A total of 17 trade-offs were identified impacting the design, development, and implementation of blockchain systems; these trade-offs are organized into themes, including business, application, data, and technology architecture. The key findings concluded the following: (1) multiple trade-offs can be managed adaptively to improve EMR utility; (2) multiple trade-offs involve improving the security of blockchain systems at the cost of other features, meaning EMR efficacy highly depends on data protection standards; and (3) multiple trade-offs result in improved blockchain scalability. Consideration of these trade-offs will be important to the specific environment in which electronic medical records are being developed. This review also uses its findings to suggest useful design choices for a hypothetical National Health Service blockchain. RR2-10.2196/10994.",

Multiple database servers with heterogeneous user authentication protocols are linked to this network. \"One-stop information shopping\" implies one log-on procedure per session, not separate log-on and log-off procedures for each server or application used during a session. These circumstances provide challenges at the policy and technical levels to data security at the network level and insuring smooth information access for end users of these network-based services. Five activities being conducted as part of our security project are described: (1) policy development; (2) an authentication server for the network; (3) Kerberos as a tool for providing mutual authentication, encryption, and time stamping of authentication messages; (4) a prototype interface using Kerberos services to authenticate users accessing a network database server; and (5) a Kerberized electronic signature.",

However, the current data storage method has the risk of data loss, leakage, and tampering, and can't support extensive and secure sharing of medical data. To realize effective and secure medical data storage and sharing among offline medical institutions and Internet medicine platforms, this study used a combined private blockchain and consortium blockchain to design a medical blockchain double-chain system (MBDS). This system can store encrypted medical data in distributed storage mode and systematically integrate the medical data of patients in offline medical institutions and Internet medicine platforms, to achieve equality, credibility, and data sharing among participating nodes. The MBDS system constructed in this study incorporated Internet medicine care services into the current healthcare system and provided new solutions and practical guidance for the future development of collaborative medical care. This study helped to solve the problems of medical data interconnection and resource sharing, improve the efficiency and effect of disease diagnosis, alleviate the contradiction between doctors and patients, and facilitate personal health management. This study has substantial theoretical and practical implications for the research and application of medical data storage and sharing.",

This has happened at the La Nostra Famiglia Institution. Local push to high priority arose from several concurrent forces, like privacy both on the patient and on the doctor side, legal and ethical aspects. Recommendations on the protection of medical data require appropriate technical and organisational measures to be taken to protect personal data against unauthorised access, alterations or any other form of inappropriate processing. In the same time quick and easy access to patient information should be granted to authorised personnel to ensure proper and in time treatment of patients. A long lasting sequence of co-operative negotiation meetings between the CMO and the chief information officer (CIO) led to appropriate outline of policies. We developed a suitable and modular architecture for designing systems that can simultaneously manage an increasing number of healthcare actors, objects and related access levels taking into account temporal conditions. Actions for keeping the prototype in use on an everyday basis are directly taken by the CMO.",

    "abstract": "Recent large-scale personal data loss incidents highlighted the need for public bodies to more securely handle confidential data. We surveyed trainees from all specialties in the Welsh Deanery for their knowledge and practice. All registered trainees were invited to participate in an online anonymised survey. There were 880 completed and non-duplicated responses (52.9% response rate). Responses were analysed using Microsoft Access. Over 40% (388/880 (44.1%)) did not use formal guidelines on storage or disposal of confidential data. The majority appeared to dispose of confidential paper documents securely, that is, using shredders and white shredder bags. However, there were significant numbers of unmarked responses. Clinical documents, such as theatre lists, were taken home by 281/880 (31.9%) of trainees. The majority secured their computers (569/871 (65.3%)) by either not keeping patient identifiable data on them or using encryption. However, 302/871 (34.7%) did not adequately secure their computers. The surgical and anaesthetic specialties were least aware of formal confidentiality guidelines (95/178 (53.4%)) and 52/102 (51.0%) respectively) and least secured their computers (106/178 (59.6%) and 63/102 (61.8%) respectively). Education is needed to improve knowledge and practice of confidential data handling. This may be delivered through workshops during induction programmes or as part of European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) modules. Training is especially indicated for the surgical and anaesthetic specialties.",

This new tool must provide security to the information processing systems and especially to the medical data exchanges between the partners who collaborate to the care of the Beyond the purely data-processing aspects of the functions of safety offered by the CPS, safety depends above all on the practices on the users, their knowledge concerning the legislation, the risks and the stakes, of their adhesion to the procedures and protections installations. The aim of this study is to evaluate this level of knowledge, the practices and the feelings of the users concerning the computer security of the medical data, to check the relevance of the step taken, and if required, to try to improve it. The survey by questionnaires involved 648 users. The practices of users in terms of data security are clearly improved by the implementation of the security server and the use of the CPS system, but security breaches due to bad practices are not however completely eliminated. That confirms that is illusory to believe that data security is first and foremost a technical issue. Technical measures are of course indispensable, but the greatest efforts are required after their implementation and consist in making the key players [2], i.e. users, aware and responsible. However, it must be stressed that the user-friendliness of the security interface has a major effect on the results observed. For instance, it is highly probable that the bad practices continued or introduced upon the implementation of the security server and CPS scheme are due to the complicated nature or functional defects of the proposed solution, which must therefore be improved. Besides, this is only the pilot phase and card holders can be expected to become more responsible as time goes by, along with the gradual national implementation of the CPS project and the introduction of new functions using electronic signatures and encryption.",

    "abstract": "The complicated nature of cloud computing encompassing internet-based technologies and service models for delivering IT applications, processing capability, storage, and memory space brings along challenging problems. Some issues such as information security, privacy, and legal aspects of cloud computing may become challenging while cross passing with another complex domain like healthcare. The present study was conducted to report the results of a systematic literature review on the legal aspects of health cloud. The original English papers published in Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Digital Library databases were extracted, among which1582 were related to the legal aspects of health cloud environment and were selected using predefined search strings. Through the review process, effective factors in relation to a health cloud legal framework were identified and accordingly, a proper design was developed for this domain. Next, the identified factors were confirmed and adjusted by mapping the contents of the selected papers to different categories and subcategories under the proposed framework. Five Main categories like the issues related to the compliance, data protection, Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM), ownership, and quality of service were selected as the basic pillars in the proposed framework. Finally, 22 papers were selected, among which 19 were mapped to the compliance issues, 18 the issues related to \"Data protection\" were addressed, and 14 \"Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM)\" was discussed. Fifteen Papers were mapped to \"Data ownership\" and \"Quality of service\" categories. Some papers were found to present some solutions in all the mentioned areas; however, most of them have addressed only a few issues.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of eHealth platforms across the world, whose main objective is to centralize patient's healthcare information to ensure the best continuity of care, requires the development of advanced tools and techniques for supporting health professionals in retrieving relevant information in this vast quantity of data. However, for preserving patient's privacy, some countries decided to de-identify and encrypt data contained in the shared Electronic Health Records, which reinforces the complexity of proposing efficient medical information retrieval approach. In this paper, we describe an original approach exploiting standards metadata as well as knowledge organizing systems to overcome the barriers of data encryption for improving the results of medical information retrieval in centralized and encrypted Electronic Health Records. This is done through the exploitation of semantic properties provided by knowledge organizing systems, which enable query expansion. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the approach together with illustrating examples and a discussion on the advantages and limitations of the provided framework.",

With the passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, as well as other security legislation across the globe, even more attention has been focused on the subject. In this article, we discuss the various types of security threats faced by healthcare institutions, from external attacks via the Internet to internal violations resulting from malice or simple carelessness. We also discuss what you can do to maintain the privacy and integrity of your electronic records--not only the computer-based safeguards that are available, but also the internal systems and procedures you need to have in place. We tell you how to go about setting up (or beefing up) your institutional security system. And we describe the security efforts being made around the world by governments and standard-setting organizations. This article also includes an extensive glossary of computer-security terms and a listing of useful data-security Web sites.",

    "abstract": "In order to prove the ElGamal CCA(Chosen Ciphertext Attack) security in the random oracle model, it is necessary to use the group where ICDH(Interactive Computational Diffie Hellman) assumption holds. Until now, only bilinear group with complex algebraic structure has been known as the ICDH group. In this paper, we introduce the ICDH group with simple algebraic structure. In other words, we prove that ICDH assumption holds in the integer group with composite modulus. On the basis of this, we propose the CCA secure hashed ElGamal and its fast variant to speed up decryption by parallel processing. Our parallel scheme has the fastest decryption among all CCA secure PKE(Public Key Encryption) schemes implemented in integer group and gives the possibility that ElGamal protocol could be practical when the big modulus numbers are used to resist the quantum attack.",

These approaches will facilitate an easy understanding of the practical challenges associated with actual-world implementation. This paper also discusses the capabilities of language modeling and its role in the knowledge system. The source code is modeled to build a deep software security analysis model. The proposed model can help software engineers build secure software by assessing the software security during software development time.

    "abstract": "In the last few years, numerous remote user authentication and session key agreement schemes have been put forwarded for Telecare Medical Information System, where the patient and medical server exchange medical information using Internet. We have found that most of the schemes are not usable for practical applications due to known security weaknesses. It is also worth to note that unrestricted number of patients login to the single medical server across the globe. Therefore, the computation and maintenance overhead would be high and the server may fail to provide services. In this article, we have designed a medical system architecture and a standard mutual authentication scheme for single medical server, where the patient can securely exchange medical data with the doctor(s) via trusted central medical server over any insecure network. We then explored the security of the scheme with its resilience to attacks. Moreover, we formally validated the proposed scheme through the simulation using Automated Validation of Internet Security Schemes and Applications software whose outcomes confirm that the scheme is protected against active and passive attacks. The performance comparison demonstrated that the proposed scheme has lower communication cost than the existing schemes in literature. In addition, the computation cost of the proposed scheme is nearly equal to the exiting schemes. The proposed scheme not only efficient in terms of different security attacks, but it also provides an efficient login, mutual authentication, session key agreement and verification and password update phases along with password recovery.",

Simultaneously, constructing an integrated EPR information system of all the patients is beneficial because it can provide medical institutions and the academia with most of the patients' information in details for them to make correct decisions and clinical decisions, to maintain and analyze patients' health. Also beneficial to doctors and scholars, the EPR system can give them record linkage for researches, payment audits, or other services bound to be developed and integrated into medicine.

    "abstract": "As the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare is expanding, patients in the European Union (EU) are increasingly subjected to automated medical decision-making. This development poses challenges to the protection of patients' rights. A specific patients' right not to be subject to automated medical decision-making is not considered part of the traditional portfolio of patients' rights. The EU AI Act also does not contain such a right. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does, however, provide for the right 'not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing' in Article 22. At the same time, this provision has been severely critiqued in legal scholarship because of its lack of practical effectiveness. However, in December 2023, the Court of Justice of the EU first provided an interpretation of this right in C-634/21 (SCHUFA)-although in the context of credit scoring. Against this background, this article provides a critical analysis of the application of Article 22 GDPR to the medical context. The objective is to evaluate whether Article 22 GDPR may provide patients with the right to refuse automated medical decision-making. It proposes a health-conformant reading to strengthen patients' rights in the EU.",

    "abstract": "With the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), industrial wireless sensors need to upload the collected private data to the cloud servers, resulting in a large amount of private data being exposed on the Internet. Private data are vulnerable to hacking. Many complex wireless-sensor-authentication protocols have been proposed. In this paper, we proposed an efficient authentication protocol for IIoT-oriented wireless sensor networks. The protocol introduces the PUF chip, and uses the Bloom filter to save and query the challenge-response pairs generated by the PUF chip. It ensures the security of the physical layer of the device and reduces the computing cost and communication cost of the wireless sensor side. The protocol introduces a pre-authentication mechanism to achieve continuous authentication between the gateway and the cloud server. The overall computational cost of the protocol is reduced. Formal security analysis and informal security analysis proved that our proposed protocol has more security features. We implemented various security primitives using the MIRACL cryptographic library and GMP large number library. Our proposed protocol was compared in-depth with related work. Detailed experiments show that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the computational cost and communication cost on the wireless sensor side and the overall computational cost of the protocol.",

    "title": "[Fraudulent use of digital radiographs: secret reality or fiction?].",
    "abstract": "Digital radiography has several advantages and has become an indispensable diagnostic tool for many dentists in daily practice. Once the digital captation appears on screen, the dental x-ray software allows image enhancement, to get a better vision and diagnosis. This image enhancement is acquired for example by adjusting the colour, density, sharpness, brightness or contrast. If the digital radiographs are exported, using various software packages created for graphic design and image manipulation, digital information can be altered, added or removed. Dental radiographs are easily duplicated, stored or spread in digital format. How can their authenticity be guaranteed, especially in insurance cases? Image enhancement features of digital radiography allow mishandling or potential abuse. Recently published studies illustrate the potential fraudulent use of digital radiography. In this article, some manipulated radiographic images are presented, to raise concerns about security, reliability and the potential for fraud.",

    "title": "Formal Analysis of the Security Protocol with Timestamp Using SPIN.",
    "abstract": "The verification of security protocols is an important basis for network security. Now, some security protocols add timestamps to messages to defend against replay attacks by network intruders. Therefore, verifying the security properties of protocols with timestamps is of great significance to ensure network security. However, previous formal analysis method of such protocols often extracted timestamps into random numbers in order to simplify the model before modeling and verification, which probably cause time-dependent security properties that are ignored. To solve this problem, a method for verifying security protocols with timestamps using model checking technique is proposed in this paper. To preserve the time-dependent properties of the protocol, Promela (process meta language) is utilized to define global clock representing the protocol system time, timer representing message transmission time, and the clock function representing the passage of time; in addition, a mechanism for checking timestamps in messages is built using Promela. To mitigate state space explosion in model checking, we propose a vulnerable channel priority method of using Promela to build intruder model. We take the famous WMF protocol as an example by modeling it with Promela and verifying it with model checker SPIN (Simple Promela Interpreter), and we have successfully found two attacks in the protocol. The results of our work can make some security schemes based on WMF protocol used in the Internet of things or other fields get security alerts. The results also show that our method is effective, and it can provide a direction for the analysis of other security protocols with timestamp in many fields.",

    "title": "Revolutionizing Medical Data Sharing Using Advanced Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: Technical, Legal, and Ethical Synthesis.",
    "abstract": "Multisite medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research. The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data utility. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely upon bespoke data sharing contracts. The lengthy process and administration induced by these contracts increases the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research. This paper provides a synthesis between 2 novel advanced privacy-enhancing technologies-homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (defined together as multiparty homomorphic encryption). These privacy-enhancing technologies provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with multiparty homomorphic encryption providing a performance advantage over separately using homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation. We argue multiparty homomorphic encryption fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using multiparty homomorphic encryption can be considered anonymized data. We explain how multiparty homomorphic encryption can reduce the reliance upon customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research while offering additional incentives for health care and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.",

    "abstract": "Protecting information privacy is likely to promote trust in the digital world and increase its use. This trust may go a long way toward motivating a wider use of networks and the internet, making the vision of the semantic web and Internet of Things a reality. Many encryption techniques that purport to protect information against known attacks are available. However, since the security challenges are ever-growing, devising effective techniques that counter the emerging challenges seems a rational response to these challenges. This paper proffers an encryption technique with a unique computational model that inspires ideas from color theory and chaotic systems. This mix offers a novel computation model with effective operations that (1) highly confuse plaintext and (2) generate key-based enormously complicated codes to hide the resulting ciphertext. Experiments with the prototype implementation showed that the proposed technique is effective (passed rigorous NIST/ENT security tests) and fast.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of human-carried mobile devices has promoted the great development of mobile crowdsensing systems. Most existing mobile crowdsensing systems depend on the crowdsensing service of the deep cloud. With the increasing scale and complexity, there is a tendency to enhance mobile crowdsensing with the edge computing paradigm to reduce latency and computational complexity, and improve the expandability and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to stimulate the strategic users to contribute more for truth discovery in the edge-assisted mobile crowdsensing. We design an incentive mechanism consisting of truth discovery stage and budget feasible reverse auction stage. In truth discovery stage, we estimate the truth for each task in both deep cloud and edge cloud. In budget feasible reverse auction stage, we design a greedy algorithm to select the winners to maximize the quality function under the budget constraint. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is computationally efficient, individually rational, truthful, budget feasible and constant approximate. Moreover, the proposed mechanism shows great superiority in terms of estimation precision and expandability.",

    "abstract": "The Medical Internet of Things (MIoTs) encompasses compact, energy-efficient wireless sensor devices designed to monitor patients' body outcomes. Healthcare networks provide constant data monitoring, enabling patients to live independently. Despite advancements in MIoTs, critical issues persist that can affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in the network. The wearable IoT module collects data and stores it on cloud servers, making it vulnerable to privacy breaches and attacks by unauthorized users. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end secure remote healthcare framework called the Four Tier Remote Healthcare Monitoring Framework (FTRHMF). This framework comprises multiple entities, including Wireless Body Sensors (WBS), Distributed Gateway (DGW), Distributed Edge Server (DES), Blockchain Server (BS), and Cloud Server (CS). The framework operates in four tiers. In the first tier, WBS and DGW are authenticated to the BS using secret credentials, ensuring privacy and security for all entities. In the second tier, authenticated WBS transmit data to the DGW via a two-level Hybridized Metaheuristic Secure Federated Clustered Routing Protocol (HyMSFCRP), which leverages Mountaineering Team-Based Optimization (MTBO) and Sea Horse Optimization (SHO) algorithms. In the third tier, sensor reports are prioritized and analyzed using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL), with the results fed into the Hybrid-Transformer Deep Learning (HTDL) model. This model combines Lite Convolutional Neural Network and Swin Transformer networks to detect patient outcomes accurately. Finally, in the fourth tier, patients' outcomes are securely stored in a cloud-assisted redactable blockchain layer, allowing modifications without compromising the integrity of the original data. This research enhance the network lifetime by 18.3 %, reduce the transmission delays by 15.6 %, ensures classification accuracy of 7.4 %, with PSNR of 46.12 dB, SSIM of 0.8894, and MAE of 22.51 when compared to the existing works.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a new and popular technology in the digital age. Blockchain technology is referred to as decentralised and distributed digital ledgers, which are called blocks. These blocks are linked together with the cryptographic hashes and are used to record transactions between many computers. No single block can be altered without altering the related blocks. Modification of individual block data is impossible because each block contains information from the previous block. This is the unique strength of blockchain. Timestamps and hashes are some of the important terms when blockchains are considered. Data security is guaranteed with this advanced technology. Blockchain technology finds its application in the healthcare industry with many advantages in a queue. Medical data can be transferred safely and securely for fool-proof management of the medicine supply chain, which helps in healthcare research. Blockchains are used to securely encrypt a patient's information in the event of an outbreak of a pandemic disease. A stroke is referred to as a brain attack, also called cerebral infarction. A cerebral infarction is a sudden stoppage of blood flow in the blood vessels connected to the brain. This study focused on evaluating the application of blockchain technology in Stroke Nursing Information Management Systems. This emerging technology is already in use in the healthcare industry. The patient's data is kept decentralized, transparent, and mainly incorruptible, thus keeping it secured and sharing of data is quick.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern medical technology and the dramatic increase in the amount of medical data, traditional centralized medical information management is facing many challenges. In recent years blockchain, which is a peer-to-peer distributed database, has been increasingly accepted and adopted by different industries and use cases. Key areas of healthcare blockchain applications include electronic medical record (EMR) management, medical device supply chain management, remote condition monitoring, insurance claims and personal health data (PHD) management, among others. Even so, there are a number of challenges in applying blockchain concepts to healthcare and its data, including interoperability, data security privacy, scalability, TPS and so on. While these challenges may hinder the development of blockchain in healthcare scenarios, they can be improved with existing technologies In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based healthcare operations management framework that is combined with the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for managing EMRs, protects data privacy through a distributed approach while ensuring that this medical ledger is tamper-proof. Doctors act as full nodes, patients can participate in network maintenance either as light nodes or as full nodes, and the hospital acts as the endpoint database of data, i.e., the IPFS node, which saves the arithmetic power of nodes and allows the data stored in the hospitals and departments to be shared with the other organizations that have uploaded the data. Therefore, the integration of blockchain and zero-knowledge proof proposed in this paper helps to protect data privacy and is efficient, better scalable, and more throughput.",

The PACS at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center consolidate images and associated data from various scanners into a centralized data archive and transmit them to remote display stations for review and consultation purposes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the model of a digital trust center that integrates cryptographic algorithms and protocols seamlessly into such a digital radiology environment to improve the security of medical images. The timing performance of encryption, decryption, and transmission of the cryptographic protocols over 81 volumetric PACS datasets has been measured. Lossless data compression is also applied before the encryption. The transmission performance is measured against three types of networks of different bandwidths: narrow-band Integrated Services Digital Network, Ethernet, and OC-3c Asynchronous Transfer Mode. The proposed digital trust center provides a cryptosystem solution to protect the confidentiality and to determine the authenticity of digital images in hospitals. The results of this study indicate that diagnostic images such as x-rays and magnetic resonance images could be routinely encrypted in PACS. However, applying encryption in teleradiology and PACS is a tradeoff between communications performance and security measures. Many people are uncertain about how to integrate cryptographic algorithms coherently into existing operations of the clinical enterprise.

    "abstract": "To describe the role of the Internet in building virtual communities of doctors, to identify threats to privacy and confidentiality in this use of the Internet, and to suggest ways in which this threat can be managed. The Internet is revolutionizing the medical profession. The doctor's role as medical expert is being challenged by patients who have immediate access to multiple sources of information about their diseases. Telemedicine makes use of the Internet to enable doctors to diagnose and treat patients far from their offices or hospitals. Internet list servers and chat groups gather doctors together in virtual space to exchange views on clinical and professional issues. This paper focuses on the last of these Internet applications, beginning with a description of the 'virtual community' that the list servers and chat groups constitute. It demonstrates how various Internet practices particular to virtual communities, namely registration, e-mail lists, and 'cookies', pose a threat to confidentiality. It discusses the conflicting values at stake, especially privacy and confidentiality on the one hand and openness and freedom on the other, and suggests how a balance between these can be achieved. The proposed resolution of the value conflict necessitates the implementation of effective registration systems, including collection of participants' personal information, and the monitoring of submissions to the chat groups. At the same time, the privacy (anonymity) of participants is maintained, except to the monitor, and the latter can intervene to delete uncivil submissions. Participants are also protected against unauthorised use of their e-mail addresses for advertising purposes and the like.",

In our constructed algorithm, the confusion mapping methods such as chaos map, encoding mapping, confusion encoding table and simulating biological operation process are used to increase the key space. Among them, the encoding mapping and the confusion encoding table provide the realization conditions for the transition of data and biological information. By selecting security parameters and confounding parameters, the algorithm realizes a more random dynamic encryption and decryption process than similar algorithms. In addition, the use of DNA storage technologies including DNA synthesis and high-throughput sequencing ensures a viable biological encryption process. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that the algorithm provides both mathematical and biological security, which not only has the difficult advantage of cracking DNA biological experiments, but also provides relatively high computational security.",

    "title": "Medical Information Protection in Internet Hospital Apps in China: Scale Development and Content Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Hospital apps are increasingly being adopted in many countries, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Web-based hospitals can provide valuable medical services and enhanced accessibility. However, increasing concerns about personal information (PI) and strict legal compliance requirements necessitate privacy assessments for these platforms. Guided by the theory of contextual integrity, this study investigates the regulatory compliance of privacy policies for internet hospital apps in the mainland of China. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the regulatory compliance of privacy policies of internet hospital apps in the mainland of China and offer recommendations for improvement. We obtained 59 internet hospital apps on November 7, 2023, and reviewed 52 privacy policies available between November 8 and 23, 2023. We developed a 3-level indicator scale based on the information processing activities, as stipulated in relevant regulations. The scale comprised 7 level-1 indicators, 26 level-2 indicators, and 70 level-3 indicators. The mean compliance score of the 52 assessed apps was 73/100 (SD 22.4%), revealing a varied spectrum of compliance. Sensitive PI protection compliance (mean 73.9%, SD 24.2%) lagged behind general PI protection (mean 90.4%, SD 14.7%), with only 12 apps requiring separate consent for processing sensitive PI (mean 73.9%, SD 24.2%). Although most apps (n=41, 79%) committed to supervising subcontractors, only a quarter (n=13, 25%) required users' explicit consent for subcontracting activities. Concerning PI storage security (mean 71.2%, SD 29.3%) and incident management (mean 71.8%, SD 36.6%), half of the assessed apps (n=27, 52%) committed to bear corresponding legal responsibility, whereas fewer than half (n=24, 46%) specified the security level obtained. Most privacy policies stated the PI retention period (n=40, 77%) and instances of PI deletion or anonymization (n=41, 79%), but fewer (n=20, 38.5%) committed to prompt third-party PI deletion. Most apps delineated various individual rights, but only a fraction addressed the rights to obtain copies (n=22, 42%) or to refuse advertisement based on automated decision-making (n=13, 25%). Significant deficiencies remained in regular compliance audits (mean 11.5%, SD 37.8%), impact assessments (mean 13.5%, SD 15.2%), and PI officer disclosure (mean 48.1%, SD 49.3%). Our analysis revealed both strengths and significant shortcomings in the compliance of internet hospital apps' privacy policies with relevant regulations. As China continues to implement internet hospital apps, it should ensure the informed consent of users for PI processing activities, enhance compliance levels of relevant privacy policies, and fortify PI protection enforcement across the information processing stages.",

    "abstract": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, instituted April 2003) Security Standards mandate health institutions to protect health information against unauthorized use or disclosure. One approach to addressing this mandate is by utilizing user access control and generating audit trails of the various authorized as well as unauthorized user access of health data. Although most current clinical image systems [e.g., picture archiving and communication system (PACS)] have components that generate log files for application debugging purposes, there is a lack of methodology to obtain and synthesize the pertinent data from the large volumes of log data generated by these multiple components within a PACS. We have designed a HIPAA-compliant architecture specifically for tracking and auditing the image workflow of clinical imaging systems such as PACS. As an initial first step, we developed HIPAA-compliant auditing system (H-CAS) based on parts of this HIPAA-compliant architecture. H-CAS was implemented within a test-bed PACS simulator located in the Image Processing and Informatics lab at the University of Southern California. Evaluation scenarios were developed where different user types performed legal and illegal access of PACS image data within each of the different components in the PACS simulator. Results were based on whether the scenarios of unauthorized access were correctly identified and documented as well as on normal operational activity. Integration and implementation pitfalls were also noted and included.",

There are two types of e-cash in general, which are online e-cash and offline e-cash. Both systems have their own pros and cons and they can be used to construct various applications. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a provably secure and efficient offline e-cash scheme with date attachability based on the blind signature technique, where expiration date and deposit date can be embedded in an e-cash simultaneously. With the help of expiration date, the bank can manage the huge database much more easily against unlimited growth, and the deposit date cannot be forged so that users are able to calculate the amount of interests they can receive in the future correctly. Furthermore, we offer security analysis and formal proofs for all essential properties of offline e-cash, which are anonymity control, unforgeability, conditional-traceability, and no-swindling.",

    "title": "Towards a Secure and Scalable Maritime Monitoring System Using Blockchain and Low-Cost IoT Technology.",
    "abstract": "Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is a strategic field of study that seeks to provide a coastal country with an effective monitoring of its maritime resources and its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In this scope, a Maritime Monitoring System (MMS) aims to leverage active surveillance of military and non-military activities at sea using sensing devices such as radars, optronics, automatic Identification Systems (AISs), and IoT, among others. However, deploying a nation-scale MMS imposes great challenges regarding the scalability and cybersecurity of this heterogeneous system. Aiming to address these challenges, this work explores the use of blockchain to leverage MMS cybersecurity and to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and availability of relevant navigation data. We propose a prototype built on a permissioned blockchain solution using HyperLedger Fabric-a robust, modular, and efficient open-source blockchain platform. We evaluate this solution's performance through a practical experiment where the prototype receives sensing data from a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR)-based low-cost AIS receiver built with a Raspberry Pi. In order to reduce scalability attrition, we developed a dockerized blockchain client easily deployed on a large scale. Furthermore, we determined, through extensive experimentation, the client optimal hardware configuration, also aiming to reduce implementation and maintenance costs. The performance results provide a quantitative analysis of the blockchain technology overhead and its impact in terms of Quality of Service (QoS), demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our solution in the scope of an MMS using AIS data.",

As a well-known tool to analyze and verify the logical consistency of concurrent systems, SPIN (Simple Promela Interpreter) has been widely used in the analysis and verification of the security of a single protocol. There is no special research on the verification of protocol security in a composition protocol environment. To solve this problem, firstly, a formal analysis method for composition protocol based on SPIN is proposed, and a formal description of protocol operation semantics is given. Then the attacker model is formalized, and a message specification method based on field detection and component recognition is presented to alleviate the state explosion problem. Finally, the NSB protocol and the NSL protocol are used as examples for compositional analysis. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively verify the security of the protocol in a composition protocol environment and enhance the efficiency of composition protocol verification.",

    "title": "HealthLock: Blockchain-Based Privacy Preservation Using Homomorphic Encryption in Internet of Things Healthcare Applications.",
    "abstract": "The swift advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with the growing application of healthcare software in this area, has given rise to significant worries about the protection and confidentiality of critical health data. To address these challenges, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution, providing decentralized and immutable data storage and transparent transaction records. However, traditional blockchain systems still face limitations in terms of preserving data privacy. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing privacy preservation in IoT-based healthcare applications using homomorphic encryption techniques combined with blockchain technology. Homomorphic encryption facilitates the performance of calculations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, thus safeguarding the data's privacy throughout the computational process. The encrypted data can be processed and analyzed by authorized parties without revealing the actual contents, thereby protecting patient privacy. Furthermore, our approach incorporates smart contracts within the blockchain network to enforce access control and to define data-sharing policies. These smart contracts provide fine-grained permission settings, which ensure that only authorized entities can access and utilize the encrypted data. These settings protect the data from being viewed by unauthorized parties. In addition, our system generates an audit record of all data transactions, which improves both accountability and transparency. We have provided a comparative evaluation with the standard models, taking into account factors such as communication expense, transaction volume, and security. The findings of our experiments suggest that our strategy protects the confidentiality of the data while at the same time enabling effective data processing and analysis. In conclusion, the combination of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology presents a solution that is both resilient and protective of users' privacy for healthcare applications integrated with IoT. This strategy offers a safe and open setting for the management and exchange of sensitive patient medical data, while simultaneously preserving the confidentiality of the patients involved.",

    "title": "Computational challenges and solutions: Prime number generation for enhanced data security.",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the computational methods and challenges associated with prime number generation, a critical component in encryption algorithms for ensuring data security. The generation of prime numbers efficiently is a critical challenge in various domains, including cryptography, number theory, and computer science. The quest to find more effective algorithms for prime number generation is driven by the increasing demand for secure communication and data storage and the need for efficient algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. Our goal is to address this challenge by presenting two novel algorithms for generating prime numbers: one that generates primes up to a given limit and another that generates primes within a specified range. These innovative algorithms are founded on the formulas of odd-composed numbers, allowing them to achieve remarkable performance improvements compared to existing prime number generation algorithms. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithms outperform well-established prime number generation algorithms such as Miller-Rabin, Sieve of Atkin, Sieve of Eratosthenes, and Sieve of Sundaram regarding mean execution time. More notably, our algorithms exhibit the unique ability to provide prime numbers from range to range with a commendable performance. This substantial enhancement in performance and adaptability can significantly impact the effectiveness of various applications that depend on prime numbers, from cryptographic systems to distributed computing. By providing an efficient and flexible method for generating prime numbers, our proposed algorithms can develop more secure and reliable communication systems, enable faster computations in number theory, and support advanced computer science and mathematics research.",

Most recently, Chiou et al. suggested an authentication protocol for TMIS by utilizing the concept of cloud environment. They claimed that their protocol is patient anonymous and well security protected. We reviewed their protocol and found that it is completely insecure against patient anonymity. Further, the same protocol is not protected against mobile device stolen attack. In order to improve security level and complexity, we design a light weight authentication protocol for the same environment.

The algorithmic bias and data security issues in AI-assisted health care have given rise to risks of infringement on general personality rights and specific personality rights. The handling of health care data and the distribution of profits from health care data have spawned disputes over data property rights. Moreover, there will also be risks of uncertainties in the attribution of liability for medical harms once AI technology becomes deeply embedded in health care. Based on the emerging changes in the legal risks associated with AI-assisted health care, it is necessary to establish a corresponding algorithm review mechanism to eliminate algorithm biases, improve the data management system through a whole-life cycle approach to ensure data security, define hierarchical data property rights and establish authorization rules to resolve property rights disputes, and reasonably assign tort liability for medical harms based on specific faults.",

    "abstract": "Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in technology have paved the way for innovative solutions in the healthcare domain, aiming to improve scalability and security while enhancing patient care. This abstract introduces a cutting-edge approach, leveraging blockchain technology and hybrid deep learning techniques to revolutionize healthcare systems. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and transparent framework, enabling secure data storage, sharing, and access control. By integrating blockchain into healthcare systems, data integrity, privacy, and interoperability can be ensured while eliminating the reliance on centralized authorities. In conjunction with blockchain, hybrid deep learning techniques offer powerful capabilities for data analysis and decision making in healthcare. Combining the strengths of deep learning algorithms with traditional machine learning approaches, hybrid deep learning enables accurate and efficient processing of complex healthcare data, including medical records, images, and sensor data. This research proposes a permissions-based blockchain framework for scalable and secure healthcare systems, integrating hybrid deep learning models. The framework ensures that only authorized entities can access and modify sensitive health information, preserving patient privacy while facilitating seamless data sharing and collaboration among healthcare providers. Additionally, the hybrid deep learning models enable real-time analysis of large-scale healthcare data, facilitating timely diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and disease prediction. The integration of blockchain and hybrid deep learning presents numerous benefits, including enhanced scalability, improved security, interoperability, and informed decision making in healthcare systems. However, challenges such as computational complexity, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for successful implementation. By harnessing the potential of blockchain and hybrid deep learning, healthcare systems can overcome traditional limitations, promoting efficient and secure data management, personalized patient care, and advancements in medical research. The proposed framework lays the foundation for a future healthcare ecosystem that prioritizes scalability, security, and improved patient outcomes.",

At the heart of this study is the digital image which is manipulated, processed, communicated, stored, compressed and archived, and which is difficult to ascertain from a legal point of view because of its intangible nature. On the one hand, personal data protection and the patient's right to privacy need to be protected through a data protection and security policy. This is particularly important in view of the capacity of IMACS to integrate with other systems such as HIS and RIS, since the information generated by the totality of these systems offers a very complete picture of any patient. On the other hand, the evanescent nature of the digital image creates legal uncertainties as to questions of evidence, of procedural and legal admissibility and acceptability and of liability.",

We also propose an improved password-based authenticated three-party key exchange protocol that addresses the security vulnerabilities identified in the Lee-Hwang protocol.",

Our contribution is as follows. 1) According to the three-tier edge computing architecture and data security storage requirements, we proposed hybrid storage architecture and model specifically adapted to edge computing. 2) Making full use of the data storage advantages of edge network devices and cloud storage servers, we build a global blockchain in the cloud service layer and local blockchain is built on the terminals of the Internet of things. Moreover, the regeneration coding is utilized to further improve the reliability of data storage in blockchains. 3) Our scheme provides a mechanism for periodically validating hash values of data to ensure the integrity of data stored in global blockchain.",

A secure and efficient authentication scheme for TMIS provides safeguarding patients' electronic patient records (EPRs) and helps health care workers and medical personnel to rapidly making correct clinical decisions. Recently, Kumari et al. proposed a password based user authentication scheme using smart cards for TMIS, and claimed that the proposed scheme could resist various malicious attacks. However, we point out that their scheme is still vulnerable to lost smart card and cannot provide forward secrecy. Subsequently, Das and Goswami proposed a secure and efficient uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. They simulated their scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool to ensure that their scheme is secure against passive and active attacks. However, we show that their scheme is still vulnerable to smart card loss attacks and cannot provide forward secrecy property. The proposed cryptanalysis discourages any use of the two schemes under investigation in practice and reveals some subtleties and challenges in designing this type of schemes.",

    "abstract": "Although face-based biometric recognition systems have been widely used in many applications, this type of recognition method is still vulnerable to presentation attacks, which use fake samples to deceive the recognition system. To overcome this problem, presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for face recognition systems (face-PAD), which aim to classify real and presentation attack face images before performing a recognition task, have been developed. However, the performance of PAD systems is limited and biased due to the lack of presentation attack images for training PAD systems. In this paper, we propose a method for artificially generating presentation attack face images by learning the characteristics of real and presentation attack images using a few captured images. As a result, our proposed method helps save time in collecting presentation attack samples for training PAD systems and possibly enhance the performance of PAD systems. Our study is the first attempt to generate PA face images for PAD system based on CycleGAN network, a deep-learning-based framework for image generation. In addition, we propose a new measurement method to evaluate the quality of generated PA images based on a face-PAD system. Through experiments with two public datasets (CASIA and Replay-mobile), we show that the generated face images can capture the characteristics of presentation attack images, making them usable as captured presentation attack samples for PAD system training.",

    "abstract": "Conficker is a computer worm that erupted on the Internet in 2008. It is unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing, neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that combines three modes of spreading: local, neighbourhood, and global, to capture the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conficker epidemic. The model is then used to explore the tradeoff between spreading modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics. Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population. When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to current internet security protocols.",

This paper proposes an approach, GeneMiner, encompassing GeneMiner-E to extract new features and GeneMiner-C for classification of input payloads as malicious and nonmalicious. The proposed approach evolves itself to the changing patterns of attack payloads and identifies adversarial XSS attacks. The experiments have been conducted by collecting data from open source and generating various combinations of scripts, functions, and tags using an incremental genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively detects newly crafted malicious XSS payloads with an accuracy of 98.5%, which is better than the existing classification techniques. The approach learns variations in the existing attack sample space and identifies the new attack payloads with reduced efforts.",

    "abstract": "For research purposes, protected health information is often redacted from unstructured electronic health records to preserve patient privacy and confidentiality. The OpenDeID corpus is designed to assist development of automatic methods to redact sensitive information from unstructured electronic health records. We retrieved 4548 unstructured surgical pathology reports from four urban Australian hospitals. The corpus was developed by two annotators under three different experimental settings. The quality of the annotations was evaluated for each setting. Specifically, we employed serial annotations, parallel annotations, and pre-annotations. Our results suggest that the pre-annotations approach is not reliable in terms of quality when compared to the serial annotations but can drastically reduce annotation time. The OpenDeID corpus comprises 2,100 pathology reports from 1,833 cancer patients with an average of 737.49 tokens and 7.35 protected health information entities annotated per report. The overall inter annotator agreement and deviation scores are 0.9464 and 0.9726, respectively. Realistic surrogates are also generated to make the corpus suitable for distribution to other researchers.",

    "title": "Combined Pseudo-Random Sequence Generator for Cybersecurity.",
    "abstract": "Random and pseudo-random number and bit sequence generators with a uniform distribution law are the most widespread and in demand in the market of pseudo-random generators. Depending on the specific field of application, the requirements for their implementation and the quality of the generator's output sequence change. In this article, we have optimized the structures of the classical additive Fibonacci generator and the modified additive Fibonacci generator when they work together. The ranges of initial settings of structural elements (seed) of these generators have been determined, which guarantee acceptable statistical characteristics of the output pseudo-random sequence, significantly expanding the scope of their possible application, including cybersecurity. When studying the statistical characteristics of the modified additive Fibonacci generator, it was found that they significantly depend on the signal from the output of the logic circuit entering the structure. It is proved that acceptable statistical characteristics of the modified additive Fibonacci generator, and the combined generator realized on its basis, are provided at odd values of the module of the recurrent equation describing the work of such generator. The output signal of the combined generator has acceptable characteristics for a wide range of values of the initial settings for the modified additive Fibonacci generator and the classic additive Fibonacci generator. Regarding the use of information security, it is worth noting the fact that for modern encryption and security programs, generators of random numbers and bit sequences and approaches to their construction are crucial and critical.",

Although 10 gene loci have been identified to cause a Parkinsonian syndrome, these loci account only for a minority of PD patients. Large, systematic research programs are required to collect, store, and analyze DNA samples and clinical information to support further discovery of additional genetic components of PD or other movement disorders. Such programs facilitate research into the relationship between genotype and phenotype. The German Competence Network on Parkinson's disease (CNP) initiated the Gene Bank Parkinson's Disease Germany (GEPARD), providing an administrative and scientific infrastructure for the storage of DNA and clinical data that are electronically accessible and protective of patient rights.

    "abstract": "Novel eHealth systems are being designed to provide a citizen-centered health system, however the even demanding need for computing and data resources has required the adoption of Grid technologies. In most of the cases, this novel Health Grid requires not only conveying patient's personal data through public networks, but also storing it into shared resources out of the hospital premises. These features introduce new security concerns, in particular related with privacy. In this paper we survey current legal and technological approaches that have been taken to protect a patient's personal data into eHealth systems, with a particular focus in Intensive Care Grids. However, thanks to a security analysis applied over the Intensive Care Grid system (ICGrid) we show that these security mechanisms are not enough to provide a comprehensive solution, mainly because the data-at-rest is still vulnerable to attacks coming from untrusted Storage Elements where an attacker may directly access them. To cope with these issues, we propose a new privacy-oriented protocol which uses a combination of encryption and fragmentation to improve data's assurance while keeping compatibility with current legislations and Health Grid security mechanisms.",

We aimed to evaluate if there was accessible, unprotected, confidential information stored on the desktop screen on computers in a district general hospital and if so, how a teaching intervention could improve this situation. An unannounced spot check of 59 ward computers was performed. Data were collected regarding how many had confidential information stored on the desktop screen without any password protection. An online learning module was mandated for healthcare staff and a second cycle of inspection performed. A district general hospital. Two doctors conducted the audit. Computers in clinical areas were assessed. All clinical staff with computer access underwent the online learning module. An online learning module regarding data protection and confidentiality. In the first cycle, 55% of ward computers had easily accessible patient or staff confidential information stored on their desktop screen. This included handovers, referral letters, staff sick leave lists, audits and nursing reports. The majority (85%) of computers accessed were logged in under a generic username and password. The intervention produced an improvement in the second cycle findings with only 26% of computers being found to have unprotected confidential information stored on them. The failure to comply with appropriate confidential data protection regulations is a persistent problem. Education produces some improvement but we also propose a systemic approach to solving this problem.",

    "title": "Digital health data security practices among health professionals in low-resource settings: cross-sectional study in Amhara Region, Ethiopia.",
    "abstract": "Protecting digital health data from unauthorized access, alteration, and destruction is a crucial aspect of healthcare digitalization. Currently, digital security breaches are becoming more common. Healthcare data breaches have compromised over 50 million medical records per year. In Ethiopia, health digitization has grown gradually. However, there is a limitation of study in digital health security. Studying digital health data security helps individuals protect digital data as a baseline and contributes to developing a digital health security policy. To assess the practice of healthcare professionals in digital health data security among specialized teaching referral hospitals in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design supplemented by a qualitative purposive sampling method was used to measure the digital data security practices of health professionals. The sample size was determined via single population proportion formula. A simple random sampling technique was used for the study participants. Then, self-administered questionnaires were administered. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify associated factors using STATA software. For the qualitative study, key informant interviews were used and analyzed using thematic analysis approach via open-code software. Out of the 423 health professionals, 95.0% were involved in the survey. The finding indicates digital health data security practice of health professionals working at specialized teaching hospitals were 45.0%, CI: (40, 50). Health professionals 41-45-year age group (AOR = 0.107), master's degree (AOR = 2.45), postmaster's degree (AOR = 3.87), time to visit the internet for more than two hours (AOR = 2.46), basic computer training (AOR = 2.77), training in digital data security (AOR = 2.14), and knowledge (AOR = 1.76) were associated with the practice of digital health data security. For the qualitative study, three teams were prepared. The findings indicate digital health data security can be improved through training, advanced knowledge and working with digital security. The practice of digital health data security in specialized teaching hospitals in the Amhara region was inadequate. Therefore, it can be improved through enhancing education status, increasing the time needed to visit the internet, providing computer training, and updating health professionals' knowledge toward digital health data security.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence-Based Ethical Hacking for Health Information Systems: Simulation Study.",
    "abstract": "Health information systems (HISs) are continuously targeted by hackers, who aim to bring down critical health infrastructure. This study was motivated by recent attacks on health care organizations that have resulted in the compromise of sensitive data held in HISs. Existing research on cybersecurity in the health care domain places an imbalanced focus on protecting medical devices and data. There is a lack of a systematic way to investigate how attackers may breach an HIS and access health care records. This study aimed to provide new insights into HIS cybersecurity protection. We propose a systematic, novel, and optimized (artificial intelligence-based) ethical hacking method tailored specifically for HISs, and we compared it with the traditional unoptimized ethical hacking method. This allows researchers and practitioners to identify the points and attack pathways of possible penetration attacks on the HIS more efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel methodological approach to ethical hacking in HISs. We implemented ethical hacking using both optimized and unoptimized methods in an experimental setting. Specifically, we set up an HIS simulation environment by implementing the open-source electronic medical record (OpenEMR) system and followed the National Institute of Standards and Technology's ethical hacking framework to launch the attacks. In the experiment, we launched 50 rounds of attacks using both unoptimized and optimized ethical hacking methods. Ethical hacking was successfully conducted using both optimized and unoptimized methods. The results show that the optimized ethical hacking method outperforms the unoptimized method in terms of average time used, the average success rate of exploit, the number of exploits launched, and the number of successful exploits. We were able to identify the successful attack paths and exploits that are related to remote code execution, cross-site request forgery, improper authentication, vulnerability in the Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher, an elevation of privilege vulnerability (in MediaTek), and remote access backdoor (in the web graphical user interface for the Linux Virtual Server). This research demonstrates systematic ethical hacking against an HIS using optimized and unoptimized methods, together with a set of penetration testing tools to identify exploits and combining them to perform ethical hacking. The findings contribute to the HIS literature, ethical hacking methodology, and mainstream artificial intelligence-based ethical hacking methods because they address some key weaknesses of these research fields. These findings also have great significance for the health care sector, as OpenEMR is widely adopted by health care organizations. Our findings offer novel insights for the protection of HISs and allow researchers to conduct further research in the HIS cybersecurity domain.",

    "abstract": "With the fast advancement of the wireless communication technology and the widespread use of medical systems, the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been widely used in healthcare environments. As the first important protocol for ensuring secure communication in healthcare environment, the RFID authentication protocols derive more and more attentions. Most of RFID authentication protocols are based on hash function or symmetric cryptography. To get more security properties, elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) has been used in the design of RFID authentication protocol. Recently, Liao and Hsiao proposed a new RFID authentication protocol using ECC and claimed their protocol could withstand various attacks. In this paper, we will show that their protocol suffers from the key compromise problem, i.e. an adversary could get the private key stored in the tag. To enhance the security, we propose a new RFID authentication protocol using ECC. Detailed analysis shows the proposed protocol not only could overcome weaknesses in Liao and Hsiao's protocol but also has the same performance. Therefore, it is more suitable for healthcare environments.",

In addition, for an organization's IS, a BN is utilized to represent its security environment and dynamically predict its security risk level, by which the security manager can select an optimal action to safeguard the firm's information resources.

    "title": "The health information system security threat lifecycle: an informatics theory.",
    "abstract": "This manuscript describes the health information system security threat lifecycle (HISSTL) theory. The theory is grounded in case study data analyzing clinicians' health information system (HIS) privacy and security (P&S) experiences in the practice context. The 'questerview' technique was applied to this study of 26 clinicians situated in 3 large Australian (across Victoria) teaching hospitals. Questerviews rely on data collection that apply standardized questions and questionnaires during recorded interviews. Analysis (using Nvivo) involved the iterative scrutiny of interview transcripts to identify emergent themes. Issues including poor training, ambiguous legal frameworks containing punitive threats, productivity challenges, usability errors and the limitations of the natural hospital environment emerged from empirical data about the clinicians' HIS P&S practices. The natural hospital environment is defined by the permanence of electronic HISs (e-HISs), shared workspaces, outdated HIT infrastructure, constant interruption, a P&S regulatory environment that is not conducive to optimal training outcomes and budgetary constraints. The evidence also indicated the obtrusiveness, timeliness, and reliability of P&S implementations for clinical work affected participant attitudes to, and use of, e-HISs. The HISSTL emerged from the analysis of study evidence. The theory embodies elements such as the fiscal, regulatory and natural hospital environments which impede P&S implementations in practice settings. These elements conflict with improved patient care outcomes. Efforts by clinicians to avoid conflict and emphasize patient care above P&S tended to manifest as security breaches. These breaches entrench factors beyond clinician control and perpetuate those within clinician control. Security breaches of health information can progress through the HISSTL. Some preliminary suggestions for addressing these issues are proposed. Legislative frameworks that are not related to direct patient care were excluded from this study. Other limitations included an exclusive focus on patient care tasks post-admission and pre-discharge from public hospital wards. Finally, the number of cases was limited by the number of participants who volunteered to participate in the study. It is reasonable to assume these participants were more interested in the P&S of patient care work than their counterparts, though the study was not intended to provide quantitative or statistical data. Nonetheless, additional case studies would strengthen the HISSTL theory if confirmatory, practice-based evidence were found.",

However it is important to protect patient confidentiality, as many medical conditions are stigmatized and disclosure could result in personal and/or financial loss. We describe a system for remote data entry that allows the data that would identify the patient to be encrypted in the web browser of the person entering the data. These data cannot be decrypted on the server by the staff at the data center but can be decrypted by the person entering the data or their delegate. We developed this system to solve a problem that arose in the context of clinical research, but it is applicable in a range of situations where sensitive information is stored and updated in a database and it is necessary to ensure that it cannot be viewed by any except those intentionally given access. By developing this system, we are able to centralize the collection of some patient data while minimizing the risk that protected health information be made available to study personnel who are not authorized to use it.",

Almost all of these schemes have tried to achieve the highest security level in transmission of patients' medical information to medical institutions through a heterogeneous network like Internet. In this paper, we explain the insecurity of these schemes against \"man-in-the-middle\" attack. Furthermore, a dynamic mobile agent system based on hybrid cryptosystem is proposed that is both secure and also efficient in computation cost. Analyzing the security criteria confirms suitability of the proposed scheme for e-medicine systems.",

    "title": "Applying your corporate compliance skills to the HIPAA security standard.",
    "abstract": "Compliance programs are an increasingly hot topic among healthcare providers. These programs establish policies and procedures covering billing, referrals, gifts, confidentiality of patient records, and many other areas. The purpose is to help providers prevent and detect violations of the law. These programs are voluntary, but are also simply good business practice. Any compliance program should now incorporate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security standard. Several sets of guidelines for development of compliance programs have been issued by the federal government, and each is directed toward a different type of healthcare provider. These guidelines share certain key features with the HIPAA security standard. This article examines the common areas between compliance programs and the HIPAA security standard to help you to do two very important things: (1) Leverage your resources by combining compliance with the security standard with other legal and regulatory compliance efforts, and (2) apply the lessons learned in developing your corporate compliance program to developing strategies for compliance with the HIPAA security standard.",

    "abstract": "Software security defects have a serious impact on the software quality and reliability. It is a major hidden danger for the operation of a system that a software system has some security flaws. When the scale of the software increases, its vulnerability has becoming much more difficult to find out. Once these vulnerabilities are exploited, it may lead to great loss. In this situation, the concept of Software Assurance is carried out by some experts. And the automated fault localization technique is a part of the research of Software Assurance. Currently, automated fault localization method includes coverage based fault localization (CBFL) and program slicing. Both of the methods have their own location advantages and defects. In this paper, we have put forward a new method, named Reverse Data Dependence Analysis Model, which integrates the two methods by analyzing the program structure. On this basis, we finally proposed a new automated fault localization method. This method not only is automation lossless but also changes the basic location unit into single sentence, which makes the location effect more accurate. Through several experiments, we proved that our method is more effective. Furthermore, we analyzed the effectiveness among these existing methods and different faults.",

We reduced the CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) exponents maintaining full sized private exponent in ElGamal with composite modulus (CRT-ElGamal) for the fast decryption as in rebalanced RSA. In this case, unlike rebalanced RSA, decryption speed up can be obtained without losing of the fast encryption speed which is comparable to RSA with small public exponent. As a result, it is possible to propose the fast public key cryptosystem in which both encryption and decryption are fast, by reducing the asymmetry (i.e., fast encryption/slow decryption) in CRT-ElGamal encryption.",

    "abstract": "To secure sensitive medical records in the healthcare clouds, this paper proposes an End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) to enhance a patient-centric blockchain-based system for electronic health record (EHR) management. The suggested system with a focus on the patient enables individuals to oversee their medical records within various involved parties by authorizing or withdrawing permission for access to their records. Utilizing the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) for record storage is chosen due to its decentralized nature and its ability to guarantee the unchangeability of records. Then an E2EE enhancement maintains the medical data integrity using dual level-Hybrid encryption: symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and asymmetric Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cryptographic techniques. The proposed system is implemented using the Ethereum blockchain system for EHR data sharing and integration utilizing a web-based interface for the patient and all users to initiate the EHR sharing transactions over the IPFS cloud. The proposed system performance is evaluated in a working system prototype. For different file sizes between 512 KB to 100 MB, the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed system were the time consumed for generating key, encryption, and decryption. The results demonstrate the proposed system's superiority over other cutting-edge systems and its practical ability to share secure health data in cloud environments.",

    "abstract": "The paradigm shift from organization-centered to managed care and on to personal health settings increases specialization and distribution of actors and services related to the health of patients or even citizens before becoming patients. As a consequence, extended communication and cooperation is required between all principals involved in health services such as persons, organizations, devices, systems, applications, and components. Personal health (pHealth) environments range over many disciplines, where domain experts present their knowledge by using domain-specific terminologies and ontologies. Therefore, the mapping of domain ontologies is inevitable for ensuring interoperability. The paper introduces the care paradigms and the related requirements as well as an architectural approach for meeting the business objectives. Furthermore, it discusses some theoretical challenges and practical examples of ontologies, concept and knowledge representations, starting general and then focusing on security and privacy related services. The requirements and solutions for empowering the patient or the citizen before becoming a patient are especially emphasized.",

    "abstract": "A growing capacity of information technologies in collection, storage and transmission of information in unprecedented amounts has produced significant problems about the availability of wide limit of the consumers of Electronic Health Records of Patients. With regard to the existence of many approaches to developing Electronic Health Records, the basic question is what kind of Model is suitable for the guarantee of the security of Electronic Health Records? The present study is a descriptive-comparative investigation conducted in Iran in 2007, along with comparisons made Electronic health records information security requirements of Australia, Canada, England and U.S.A with. The research was based on the study of texts such as articles, library's books and journals and reliable websites from 1992 to 2006. Based on the collected data, a primary Model was designed. The Delphi Technique was offered to evaluate the questionnaire and final Model was designed and proposed. Australia, Canada, England and U.S.A have requirements related to organizing information security, classifying and controlling information asset, security of human resources, environmental and physical security, Operational and communication management security, information access control security and development and Maintenance security of Electronic Health Records information systems. In the U.S.A, the above security requirements are presented in administrative, Physical and Technical safeguards. Based on the research findings, a comprehensive model of electronic health record security requirements in seven pivots is presented for Iran. This model is a collection of EHR security requirements from studied countries. The studied countries are solely subject to part of elements of this model. The suggested model is different from the ones used in other countries in some respects and is recommended for application in Iran.",

    "title": "Enabling Blockchain Services for IoE with Zk-Rollups.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things includes all connected objects from small embedded systems with low computational power and storage capacities to efficient ones, as well as moving objects like drones and autonomous vehicles. The concept of Internet of Everything expands upon this idea by adding people, data and processing. The adoption of such systems is exploding and becoming ever more significant, bringing with it questions related to the security and the privacy of these objects. A natural solution to data integrity, confidentiality and single point of failure vulnerability is the use of blockchains. Blockchains can be used as an immutable data layer for storing information, avoiding single point of failure vulnerability via decentralization and providing strong security and cryptographic tools for IoE. However, the adoption of blockchain technology in such heterogeneous systems containing light devices presents several challenges and practical issues that need to be overcome. Indeed, most of the solutions proposed to adapt blockchains to devices with low resources confront difficulty in maintaining decentralization or security. The most interesting are probably the Layer 2 solutions, which build offchain systems strongly connected to the blockchain. Among these, zk-rollup is a promising new generation of Layer 2/off-chain schemes that can remove the last obstacles to blockchain adoption in IoT, or more generally, in IoE. By increasing the scalability and enabling rule customization while preserving the same security as the Layer 1 blockchain, zk-rollups overcome restrictions on the use of blockchains for IoE. Despite their promises illustrated by recent systems proposed by startups and private companies, very few scientific publications explaining or applying this barely-known technology have been published, especially for non-financial systems. In this context, the objective of our paper is to fill this gap for IoE systems in two steps. We first propose a synthetic review of recent proposals to improve scalability including onchain (consensus, blockchain organization, …) and offchain (sidechain, rollups) solutions and we demonstrate that zk-rollups are the most promising ones. In a second step, we focus on IoE by describing several interesting features (scalability, dynamicity, data management, …) that are illustrated with various general IoE use cases.",

    "title": "Quality of protection evaluation of security mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Recent research indicates that during the design of teleinformatic system the tradeoff between the systems performance and the system protection should be made. The traditional approach assumes that the best way is to apply the strongest possible security measures. Unfortunately, the overestimation of security measures can lead to the unreasonable increase of system load. This is especially important in multimedia systems where the performance has critical character. In many cases determination of the required level of protection and adjustment of some security measures to these requirements increase system efficiency. Such an approach is achieved by means of the quality of protection models where the security measures are evaluated according to their influence on the system security. In the paper, we propose a model for QoP evaluation of security mechanisms. Owing to this model, one can quantify the influence of particular security mechanisms on ensuring security attributes. The methodology of our model preparation is described and based on it the case study analysis is presented. We support our method by the tool where the models can be defined and QoP evaluation can be performed. Finally, we have modelled TLS cryptographic protocol and presented the QoP security mechanisms evaluation for the selected versions of this protocol.",

That perspective started to change as researchers and practitioners realized the importance of economics. As distributed systems are increasingly composed of machines that belong to principals with divergent interests, incentives are becoming as important to dependability as technical design. A thriving new field of information security economics provides valuable insights not just into 'security' topics such as privacy, bugs, spam and phishing, but into more general areas of system dependability and policy. This research programme has recently started to interact with psychology. One thread is in response to phishing, the most rapidly growing form of online crime, in which fraudsters trick people into giving their credentials to bogus websites; a second is through the increasing importance of security usability; and a third comes through the psychology-and-economics tradition. The promise of this multidisciplinary research programme is a novel framework for analysing information security problems-one that is both principled and effective.",

The study reported in this article focused on the implementation of SmartWalk security services to keep personal data safe during communications and while at rest, which were validated considering a comprehensive use case. The security framework offers various mechanisms, including an authentication system that was designed to complement the pairs of usernames and passwords with trusted execution environments and token-based features, authorization with different access levels, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, critical transactions review, and logging supported by blockchain technology.

    "abstract": "Deployment of secured healthcare information is a major challenge in a web-based environment. eHealth services are subjected to same security threats as other services. The purpose of blockchain is to provide a structure and security to the organization data. Healthcare data deals with confidential information. The medical records can be well organized and empower their propagation in a secured manner through the usage of blockchain technology. The study throws light on providing security of health services through blockchain technology. The authors have analyzed the various aspects of role of blockchain in healthcare through an extensive literature review. The application of blockchain in COVID-19 has also been analyzed and discussed in the study. Further application of blockchain in Indian healthcare has been highlighted in the paper. The study provides suggestions for strengthening the healthcare system by blending machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, and IoT with blockchain.",

    "title": "Cloud-assisted mutual authentication and privacy preservation protocol for telecare medical information systems.",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies and the growing prevalence of smart devices, telecare medical information system (TMIS) allows patients to receive medical treatments from the doctors via Internet technology without visiting hospitals in person. By adopting mobile device, cloud-assisted platform and wireless body area network, the patients can collect their physiological conditions and upload them to medical cloud via their mobile devices, enabling caregivers or doctors to provide patients with appropriate treatments at anytime and anywhere. In order to protect the medical privacy of the patient and guarantee reliability of the system, before accessing the TMIS, all system participants must be authenticated. Mohit et al. recently suggested a lightweight authentication protocol for cloud-based health care system. They claimed their protocol ensures resilience of all well-known security attacks and has several important features such as mutual authentication and patient anonymity. In this paper, we demonstrate that Mohit et al.'s authentication protocol has various security flaws and we further introduce an enhanced version of their protocol for cloud-assisted TMIS, which can ensure patient anonymity and patient unlinkability and prevent the security threats of report revelation and report forgery attacks. The security analysis proves that our enhanced protocol is secure against various known attacks as well as found in Mohit et al.'s protocol. Compared with existing related protocols, our enhanced protocol keeps the merits of all desirable security requirements and also maintains the efficiency in terms of computation costs for cloud-assisted TMIS. We propose a more secure mutual authentication and privacy preservation protocol for cloud-assisted TMIS, which fixes the mentioned security weaknesses found in Mohit et al.'s protocol. According to our analysis, our authentication protocol satisfies most functionality features for privacy preservation and effectively cope with cloud-assisted TMIS with better efficiency.",

Since chaotic maps have superior characteristics, researchers have recently presented some of the studies that apply it to authentication key exchange and cryptography. Providing user anonymity in the authentication key exchange is one of the important security requirements to protect users' personal secrets. We analyse Lu et al.'s scheme which attempts to provide user anonymity and we prove that his scheme has errors in the key exchange phase and password change phase.

Clinical cases were initially discussed between the referring physician and radiologist in Tyrol using a video-phone. Subsequent correspondence, including the transmission of images between the referring physician and the radiologist, was carried out by e-mail using the security system to prevent unauthorized access to patient information. Seventy-eight teleradiology sessions were conducted using this data security system. Speed and stability of data exchange were unaffected by the additional security feature. The average log-on time to the system was 7.8 s. The average training time on how to use the system was 15 min. The radiologist was able to issue a final patient report using the system within 1.5 of the initial contact. The data security feature was user-friendly and did not hinder the normal teleradiology consultation.",

An mHealth system enables healthcare experts and professionals to have ubiquitous access to a patient's health data along with providing any ongoing medical treatment at any time, any place, and from any device. It also helps the patient requiring continuous medical monitoring to stay in touch with the appropriate medical staff and healthcare experts remotely. Thus, mHealth has become a major driving force in improving the health of citizens today. First, we discuss the security requirements, issues and threats to the mHealth system. We then present a taxonomy of recently proposed security protocols for mHealth system based on features supported and possible attacks, computation cost and communication cost. Our detailed taxonomy demonstrates the strength and weaknesses of recently proposed security protocols for the mHealth system. Finally, we identify some of the challenges in the area of security protocols for mHealth systems that still need to be addressed in the future to enable cost-effective, secure and robust mHealth systems.",

This includes improvements in existing technology as well as innovations in mobile technology such as smartphone apps and wearables. Health data is strictly regulated under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Under current data protection rules, health data is broadly interpreted and will, in most circumstances not connected to the provision of healthcare, require organisations to obtain explicit consent from individuals for its collection and use. Further data protection compliance issues arise such as identifying who is a controller, ensuring transparency, using health data for research purposes and keeping health data secure. As the EU data protection landscape is due to change in the next few years and will affect the collection and use of health data, the forthcoming Data Protection Regulation also deserves attention.",

Public cloud services could be a solution that eases the cost of ownership and provide greater flexibility for PACS implementations. Moving these systems to the public cloud requires that an authentication and encryption policy for communications is established within the PACS environment.

However, EHRs still manifest poor interoperability and privacy issues are unresolved. As a distributed ledger protocol composed of encrypted blocks of data organized in chains, blockchain represents a potential tool to solve the shortcomings of EHRs in terms of interoperability and privacy. In this paper, we define EHRs and blockchain technology and introduce several classic schemes based on blockchain technology to strengthen EHR interoperability and privacy protection. We then review ongoing challenges in the areas of data management efficiency, fairness of access, and trust in the systems. In this commentary, we suggest ongoing research needs for health informatics, data sciences, and ethics to establish EHRs based on blockchain technology. Blockchain-based EHR schemes must address the potential inequality of healthcare resources, the huge carbon footprint of computational needs, and potential distrust of health providers and patients that may ensue with wider use of blockchain technology.",

Compared to existing scalable and semantically secure RIBE schemes, our proposed RIBE scheme is more efficient in term of ciphertext size, public parameters size and decryption cost at price of a little looser security reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of scalable and semantically secure RIBE scheme with constant size public system parameters.",

Patient security and privacy has emerged as key issues during remote access because of underlying open architecture. An authentication scheme can verify patient's as well as TMIS server's legitimacy during remote healthcare services. To achieve security and privacy a number of authentication schemes have been proposed. Very recently Lu et al. (J. Med. Syst. 39(3):1-8, 2015) proposed a biometric based three factor authentication scheme for TMIS to confiscate the vulnerabilities of Arshad et al.'s (J. Med. Syst. 38(12):136, 2014) scheme. Further, they emphasized the robustness of their scheme against several attacks. However, in this paper we establish that Lu et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to numerous attacks including (1) Patient anonymity violation attack, (2) Patient impersonation attack, and (3) TMIS server impersonation attack. Furthermore, their scheme does not provide patient untraceability. We then, propose an improvement of Lu et al.'s scheme. We have analyzed the security of improved scheme using popular automated tool ProVerif. The proposed scheme while retaining the plusses of Lu et al.'s scheme is also robust against known attacks.",

    "title": "Implementing HIPAA security in a membership organization.",
    "abstract": "The upcoming HIPAA security regulations are forcing a change in business and operating procedures that many, if not most, healthcare organizations are ill-prepared to tackle. Of all healthcare organizational structures, membership organizations will most likely face the greatest number of obstacles in preparing for and implementing the HIPAA security regulations. This is because the membership organization as a whole must find a way to accommodate the disparate technologies, business and operating methodologies and processes, and available, limited resources of its individual member organizations, and integrate these into a uniform implementation plan. Compounding these obvious difficulties is the unique challenge of enforcement authority. The individual member organizations are autonomous business entities, whereas the membership organization as a whole merely acts as an advisor or consultant, and has only limited enforcement authority over any individual member organization. This article explores this unique situation in depth. We focus on PROMINA Health System, a nonprofit healthcare membership organization that consists of five disparate member healthcare organizations. We examine the challenges PROMINA has encountered in its quest to institute an organization-wide HIPAA security program and its methodology for accomplishing program implementation.",

    "title": "Going Beyond Compliance: A Strategic Framework for Promoting Information Security in Hospitals.",
    "abstract": "In the past decade, public and private organizations have experienced a significant and alarming rise in the number of data breaches. Across all sectors, there seems to be no safe haven for the protection of information. In the health care industry, the trend is even worse. Information security is at an unbelievable low point, and it is unlikely that government oversight can fix this issue. Health care organizations have ramped up their approaches to addressing the problem; however, these initiatives are often incremental rather than transformational. Hospitals need an overall organization-wide strategy to prevent breaches from occurring and to minimize effects if they do occur. This article provides an analysis of the literature related to health information security and offers a suggested strategy for hospital administrators to follow in order to create a more secure environment for patient health information.",

    "title": "Accurate Approach Towards Efficiency of Searching Agents in Digital Libraries Using Keywords.",
    "abstract": "The age of information has done it simple for storing huge amount of data. In actual fact, a considerable segment of existing information is accumulated in the text databases that have huge set of documents from different sources like research articles, news articles, books, e-mail messages, web pages and digital libraries. In many text databases, stored data are in the semi-structured format in that they are neither entirely structured nor entirely unstructured. IR (Information Retrieval) field has been growing in parallel using database systems for several years. Contrasting to the databases system fields that have concentrated mainly on transaction and query processing of the structured data, IR is concerned with firm and retrieval of data from a huge quantity of text-oriented documents. Thus, IR tackles with unstructured and/or semi-structured databases. Information security requirements within a firm have experience major variations in the past some decades. By the establishment of computer, the necessary for automated equipment for securing files as well as other information that stored on the computer turned into evident. This is particularly in case of shared information resources via public network. This is the origin for having a secure computer system / the need for computer security. Computer Security can be achieved by Intrusion Detection Systems. In this paper, we address these issues by applying Similarity Search in two diversified fields: Digital Libraries and Computer Security. The paper discusses a fast and efficient similarity search technique for approximate retrieval of books metadata in Digital Libraries. In DLI the books retrieval takes place just by using metadata such as title, year, edition, author, publishing of a book. Though, if metadata is missing, incorrect or unfinished, then it creates the library retrieval system inefficient, incorrect leads too much confusion to the user. In this context even if the query from the user matches partially or fully with a stored pattern, the information related to that be retrieved. The paper talks about a method that functions rapid and effective, language independent, and flexible library retrieval system signature based similarity search. This system is able to retrieve not only the metadata that exactly matches the query but also fairly accurate identical because of missing words, jumbled words and spell mistakes. Fundamentally, signature file approach is used here. A signature file approach looks like the most capable for huge database as it has superior text retrieval features and requires little storage overhead.",

    "title": "Medical image security in a HIPAA mandated PACS environment.",
    "abstract": "Medical image security is an important issue when digital images and their pertinent patient information are transmitted across public networks. Mandates for ensuring health data security have been issued by the federal government such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), where healthcare institutions are obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that patient information is only provided to people who have a professional need. Guidelines, such as digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) standards that deal with security issues, continue to be published by organizing bodies in healthcare. However, there are many differences in implementation especially for an integrated system like picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and the infrastructure to deploy these security standards is often lacking. Over the past 6 years, members in the Image Processing and Informatics Laboratory, Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles/University of Southern California, have actively researched image security issues related to PACS and teleradiology. The paper summarizes our previous work and presents an approach to further research on the digital envelope (DE) concept that provides image integrity and security assurance in addition to conventional network security protection. The DE, including the digital signature (DS) of the image as well as encrypted patient information from the DICOM image header, can be embedded in the background area of the image as an invisible permanent watermark. The paper outlines the systematic development, evaluation and deployment of the DE method in a PACS environment. We have also proposed a dedicated PACS security server that will act as an image authority to check and certify the image origin and integrity upon request by a user, and meanwhile act also as a secure DICOM gateway to the outside connections and a PACS operation monitor for HIPAA supporting information.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we implemented an integrated security solution with Spring Security and Keycloak open-access platform (SSK) to secure data collection and exchange over microservice architecture application programming interfaces (APIs). The adopted solution implemented the following security features: open authorization, multi-factor authentication, identity brokering, and user management to safeguard microservice APIs. Then, we extended the security solution with a virtual private network (VPN), Blowfish and crypt (Bcrypt) hash, encryption method, API key, network firewall, and secure socket layer (SSL) to build up a digital infrastructure. To accomplish and describe the adopted SSK solution, we utilized a web engineering security method. As a case study, we designed and developed an electronic health coaching (eCoach) prototype system and hosted the system in the expanded digital secure infrastructure to collect and exchange personal health data over microservice APIs. We further described our adopted security solution's procedural, technical, and practical considerations. We validated our SSK solution implementation by theoretical evaluation and experimental testing. We have compared the test outcomes with related studies qualitatively to determine the efficacy of the hybrid security solution in digital infrastructure. The SSK implementation and configuration in the eCoach prototype system has effectively secured its microservice APIs from an attack in all the considered scenarios with 100% accuracy. The developed digital infrastructure with SSK solution efficiently sustained a load of (≈)300 concurrent users. In addition, we have performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions: Spring-based security, Keycloak-based security, and their combination (our utilized hybrid security solution), where SSK showed a promising outcome.",

    "abstract": "Modern information technology offers efficiencies in medical practice, with a reduction in secretarial time in maintaining, filing and retrieving the paper medical record. Electronic requesting of investigations allows tracking of outstanding results. Less storage space is required and telephone calls from pharmacies, pathology and medical imaging service providers to clarify the hand-written request are abolished. Voice recognition software reduces secretarial typing time per letter. These combined benefits can lead to significantly reduced costs and improved patient care. The paperless office is possible, but requires commitment and training of all staff; it is preferable but not absolutely essential that at least one member of the practice has an interest and some expertise in computers. More importantly, back-up from information technology providers and back-up of the electronic data are absolutely crucial and a paperless environment should not be considered without them.",

    "title": "A New MANET wormhole detection algorithm based on traversal time and hop count analysis.",
    "abstract": "As demand increases for ubiquitous network facilities, infrastructure-less and self-configuring systems like Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) are gaining popularity. MANET routing security however, is one of the most significant challenges to wide scale adoption, with wormhole attacks being an especially severe MANET routing threat. This is because wormholes are able to disrupt a major component of network traffic, while concomitantly being extremely difficult to detect. This paper introduces a new wormhole detection paradigm based upon Traversal Time and Hop Count Analysis (TTHCA), which in comparison to existing algorithms, consistently affords superior detection performance, allied with low false positive rates for all wormhole variants. Simulation results confirm that the TTHCA model exhibits robust wormhole route detection in various network scenarios, while incurring only a small network overhead. This feature makes TTHCA an attractive choice for MANET environments which generally comprise devices, such as wireless sensors, which possess a limited processing capability.",

To ensure patients securely access to medicinal services, many authentication schemes have been proposed.

To design a truly secure and practical authentication scheme for TMIS, a new biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS without sharing the system private key with distributed servers is presented in this work. Our proposed protocol has perfect security features including mutual authentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and resisting various well-known attacks, and these security feathers are confirmed by the BAN logic and heuristic cryptanalysis, respectively. A secure biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS is presented in this work, which has perfect security properties including perfect forward secrecy, supporting user anonymity, etc., and can withstand various attacks such as impersonation attack, off-line password guessing attack, etc.. Considering security is the most important factor for an authentication scheme, so our scheme is more suitable for multi-server TMIS.",

    "abstract": "The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) helps the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and access medical services over the Internet of mobile networks. Recently, Amin and Biswas presented a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for TMIS system using the cryptographic one-way hash function and biohashing function, and claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. Though their scheme is efficient due to usage of one-way hash function, we show that their scheme has several security pitfalls and design flaws, such as (1) it fails to protect privileged-insider attack, (2) it fails to protect strong replay attack, (3) it fails to protect strong man-in-the-middle attack, (4) it has design flaw in user registration phase, (5) it has design flaw in login phase, (6) it has design flaw in password change phase, (7) it lacks of supporting biometric update phase, and (8) it has flaws in formal security analysis. In order to withstand these security pitfalls and design flaws, we aim to propose a secure and robust user authenticated key agreement scheme for the hierarchical multi-server environment suitable in TMIS using the cryptographic one-way hash function and fuzzy extractor. Through the rigorous security analysis including the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, the formal security analysis under the random oracle model and the informal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The simulation results show that our scheme is also secure. Our scheme is more efficient in computation and communication as compared to Amin-Biswas's scheme and other related schemes. In addition, our scheme supports extra functionality features as compared to other related schemes. As a result, our scheme is very appropriate for practical applications in TMIS.",

However, there is a plethora of challenges in these healthcare PKI infrastructures. Especially, there are a lot of challenges for PKI infrastructures deployed over large-scale healthcare networks. In this paper, we propose a PKI infrastructure to ensure security in a large-scale Internet-based healthcare network connecting a wide spectrum of healthcare units geographically distributed within a wide region. Furthermore, the proposed PKI infrastructure facilitates the trust issues that arise in a large-scale healthcare network including multi-domain PKI infrastructures.",

    "title": "A robust ECC based mutual authentication protocol with anonymity for session initiation protocol.",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is found as a substantial application-layer protocol for the multimedia services. It is extensively used for managing, altering, terminating and distributing the multimedia sessions. Authentication plays a pivotal role in SIP environment. Currently, Lu et al. presented an authentication protocol for SIP and profess that newly proposed protocol is protected against all the familiar attacks. However, the detailed analysis describes that the Lu et al.'s protocol is exposed against server masquerading attack and user's masquerading attack. Moreover, it also fails to protect the user's identity as well as it possesses incorrect login and authentication phase. In order to establish a suitable and efficient protocol, having ability to overcome all these discrepancies, a robust ECC-based novel mutual authentication mechanism with anonymity for SIP is presented in this manuscript. The improved protocol contains an explicit parameter for user to cope the issues of security and correctness and is found to be more secure and relatively effective to protect the user's privacy, user's masquerading and server masquerading as it is verified through the comprehensive formal and informal security analysis.",

    "abstract": "Health care organizations have been challenged by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for some time, while in January 2020, it was not immediately suspected that it would take such a global expansion. In the past, other studies have already pointed out that health care systems, and more specifically hospitals, can be a so-called \"soft target\" for terrorist attacks. This report has now examined whether this is also the case in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.During the lockdown, hospitals turned out to be the only remaining soft targets for attacks, given that the other classic targets were closed during the lockdown. On the other hand, other important factors have limited the risk of such attacks in hospitals. The main delaying and relative risk-reducing factors were the access control on temperature and wearing a mask, no visits allowed, limited consultations, and investigations.But even then, health care systems and hospitals were prone to (cyber)terrorism, as shown by other COVID-19-related institutions, such as pharmaceuticals involved in developing vaccines and health care facilities involved in swab testing and contact tracing. Counter-terrorism medicine (CTM) and social behavioral science can reduce the likelihood and impact of terrorism, but cannot prevent (state-driven) cyberterrorism and actions of lone wolves and extremist factions.",

In this system, the effective support of clinical data management dimensions leads to the increased accuracy of results and prevention of diversion in clinical trials. The aim of this review article was to investigate the dimensions of data management in clinical data management systems. This study was conducted in 2017. The used databases included Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, ProQuest, Ovid Medline and PubMed. The search was conducted over a period of 10 years from 2007 to 2017. The initial number of studies was 101 reaching 19 in the final stage. The final studies were described and compared in terms of the year, country and dimensions of the clinical data management process in clinical trials. The research findings indicated that none of the systems completely supported the data management dimensions in clinical trials. Although these systems were developed for supporting the clinical data management process, they were similar to electronic data capture systems in many cases. The most significant dimensions of data management in such systems were data collection or entry, report, validation, and security maintenance. Seemingly, not sufficient attention has been paid to automate all dimensions of the clinical data management process in clinical trials. However, these systems could take positive steps towards changing the manual processes of clinical data management to electronic processes.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has gained significant attention in several sectors owing to its distributed ledger, decentralized nature, and cryptographic security. Despite its potential to reform the healthcare industry by providing a unified and secure system for health records, blockchain adoption remains limited. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the intention to adopt blockchain in healthcare by focusing on healthcare providers. A theoretical model is proposed by integrating the Technological-Organizational-Environmental framework, Fit-Viability Model, and institutional theory. A quantitative approach was adopted and data were collected through an online survey of 199 hospitals to evaluate the model. The collected data were analysed using PLS-SEM. The results indicated that technology trust, information transparency, disintermediation, cost-effectiveness, top management support, organizational readiness, partner readiness, technology vendor support, fit, and viability significantly and positively influenced the intention to adopt blockchain-based Health Information Systems in hospitals. Conversely, coercive pressure from the government negatively affects adoption decisions. Moreover, the study found that the hospital ownership type did not moderate the relationship between the identified factors and blockchain adoption. This study provides valuable insights into the various factors that influence blockchain adoption in hospitals. The developed model offers guidelines for hospitals, blockchain providers, governments, and policymakers to devise strategies that promote implementation and encourage widespread adoption of blockchain in healthcare organizations.",

According to the theory of stream cipher, this method uses Chebyshev map to form encryption key. A series of coding operations are used to set the initial value before image chaos processing. Combining with logical mapping, the original image information is encrypted by chaos from X and Y dimensions. The experimental results show that the NPCR value of the encrypted image is 0.9874 after the blood cells are encrypted. All four evaluation methods fully prove that this method has excellent encryption performance.",

    "title": "Blockchain-Based Access Control Scheme for Secure Shared Personal Health Records over Decentralised Storage.",
    "abstract": "Blockchain technology provides a tremendous opportunity to transform current personal health record (PHR) systems into a decentralised network infrastructure. However, such technology possesses some drawbacks, such as issues in privacy and storage capacity. Given its transparency and decentralised features, medical data are visible to everyone on the network and are inappropriate for certain medical applications. By contrast, storing vast medical data, such as patient medical history, laboratory tests, X-rays, and MRIs, significantly affect the repository storage of blockchain. This study bridges the gap between PHRs and blockchain technology by offloading the vast medical data into the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage and establishing an enforced cryptographic authorisation and access control scheme for outsourced encrypted medical data. The access control scheme is constructed on the basis of the new lightweight cryptographic concept named smart contract-based attribute-based searchable encryption (SC-ABSE). This newly cryptographic primitive is developed by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) and by leveraging the technology of smart contracts to achieve the following: (1) efficient and secure fine-grained access control of outsourced encrypted data, (2) confidentiality of data by eliminating trusted private key generators, and (3) multikeyword searchable mechanism. Based on decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman hardness assumptions (DBDH) and discrete logarithm (DL) problems, the rigorous security indistinguishability analysis indicates that SC-ABSE is secure against the chosen-keyword attack (CKA) and keyword secrecy (KS) in the standard model. In addition, user collusion attacks are prevented, and the tamper-proof resistance of data is ensured. Furthermore, security validation is verified by simulating a formal verification scenario using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), thereby unveiling that SC-ABSE is resistant to man-in-the-middle (MIM) and replay attacks. The experimental analysis utilised real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and utility of SC-ABSE in terms of computation overhead, storage cost and communication overhead. The proposed scheme is also designed and developed to evaluate throughput and latency transactions using a standard benchmark tool known as Caliper. Lastly, simulation results show that SC-ABSE has high throughput and low latency, with an ultimate increase in network life compared with traditional healthcare systems.",

    "title": "Applications of Blockchain Technology for Data-Sharing in Oncology: Results from a Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Timely sharing of electronic health records across providers, while ensuring data security and privacy, is essential for prompt care of cancer patients, as well as for the development of medical research and the enhancement of personalized medicine. Yet, it is not trivial to achieve efficient consent management, data exchange, and access-control policy enforcement, in particular, in decentralized settings, and given the gravity of the condition such as cancer. Using blockchain technology (BCT) has been recently advocated by research communities and gained momentum from the industry perspective. However, most of the proposed solutions are at the level of a prototype, and blockchain-based healthcare data management systems are not in place yet. This paper presents a systematic literature review, aiming to analyze the motivations, advantages, and limitations, as well as barriers and future challenges faced when applying the state-of-the-art distributed ledger technology in oncology. We then discuss its outcomes and propose the direction of the future research that can help to attain integration and adoption of the BCT for data-sharing, medical research, and the pharmaceutical supply chain in oncology, as well as in healthcare in general. Key Messages:BCT has the potential to enhance data-sharing (for primary care and medical research), as well as to attain optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain by bringing properties such as transparency, traceability, and immutability to the applications. However, BCT itself cannot guarantee data privacy and security. Thus, it is never proposed as a stand-alone technology, but as a combined technology with cryptographic techniques. Regardless of the number of existing prototypes of blockchain-based healthcare systems, due to the existing barriers of the adoption (e.g., legal, social, and technological limitations), there is a lack of evaluation in real-world settings. Aiming to overcome these limitations, we propose future research directions that include design of the privacy-preserving hybrid data storage, interoperable infrastructures and architecture, and are compliant with the international laws and regulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the role of information security (IS) in shaping the dissemination and re-use of biomedical data, as well as the embedding of such data in material, social and regulatory landscapes of research. We consider data management practices adopted by two UK-based data linkage infrastructures: the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage, a Welsh databank that facilitates appropriate re-use of health data derived from research and routine medical practice in the region, and the Medical and Environmental Data Mash-up Infrastructure, a project bringing together researchers to link and analyse complex meteorological, environmental and epidemiological data. Through an in-depth analysis of how data are sourced, processed and analysed in these two cases, we show that IS takes two distinct forms: epistemic IS, focused on protecting the reliability and reusability of data as they move across platforms and research contexts, and infrastructural IS, concerned with protecting data from external attacks, mishandling and use disruption. These two dimensions are intertwined and mutually constitutive, and yet are often perceived by researchers as being in tension with each other. We discuss how such tensions emerge when the two dimensions of IS are operationalized in ways that put them at cross purpose with each other, thus exemplifying the vulnerability of data management strategies to broader governance and technological regimes. We also show that whenever biomedical researchers manage to overcome the conflict, the interplay between epistemic and infrastructural IS prompts critical questions concerning data sources, formats, metadata and potential uses, resulting in an improved understanding of the wider context of research and the development of relevant resources. This informs and significantly improves the reusability of biomedical data, while encouraging exploratory analyses of secondary data sources.",

    "title": "Reversible data hiding techniques with high message embedding capacity in images.",
    "abstract": "Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) techniques have gained popularity over the last two decades, where data is embedded in an image in such a way that the original image can be restored. Earlier works on RDH was based on the Image Histogram Modification that uses the peak point to embed data in the image. More recent works focus on the Difference Image Histogram Modification that exploits the fact that the neighbouring pixels of an image are highly correlated and therefore the difference of image makes more space to embed large amount of data. In this paper we propose a framework to increase the embedding capacity of reversible data hiding techniques that use a difference of image to embed data. The main idea is that, instead of taking the difference of the neighboring pixels, we rearrange the columns (or rows) of the image in a way that enhances the smooth regions of an image. Any difference based technique to embed data can then be used in the transformed image. The proposed method is applied on different types of images including textures, patterns and publicly available images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only increases the message embedding capacity of a given image by more than 50% but also the visual quality of the marked image containing the message is more than the visual quality obtained by existing state-of-the-art reversible data hiding technique. The proposed technique is also verified by Pixel Difference Histogram (PDH) Stegoanalysis and results demonstrate that marked images generated by proposed method is undetectable by PDH analysis.",

Excessive regulation can create barriers to appropriate patient treatment. The main objective of this paper is to present a new methodology that can define, from legislation to practice, an access control policy as well as a RBAC model, in order to comprise generic legislation and regulation issues together with the access control needs from the ends users of a healthcare information system. The methodology includes the use of document analysis as well as grounded theory and mixed methods research. This methodology can be easily applied within a healthcare practice or any other domain with similar requirements. It helps to bridge the gap between legislation and end users' needs, while integrating information security into the healthcare processes in a more meaningful way.",

    "abstract": "Location information of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is very important, for it makes information that is collected and reported by the sensor nodes spatially meaningful for applications. Since most current sensor localization schemes rely on location information that is provided by beacon nodes for the regular sensor nodes to locate themselves, the accuracy of localization depends on the accuracy of location information from the beacon nodes. Therefore, the security and reliability of the beacon nodes become critical in the localization of regular sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based security scheme for sensor localization to improve the security and the accuracy of sensor localization in hostile or untrusted environments. In our proposed scheme, the reputation of each beacon node is evaluated based on a reputation evaluation model so that regular sensor nodes can get credible location information from highly reputable beacon nodes to accomplish localization. We also perform a set of simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reputation-based security scheme. And our simulation results show that the proposed security scheme can enhance the security and, hence, improve the accuracy of sensor localization in hostile or untrusted environments.",

    "title": "Secure Collaborative Platform for Health Care Research in an Open Environment: Perspective on Accountability in Access Control.",
    "abstract": "With the recent use of IT in health care, a variety of eHealth data are increasingly being collected and stored by national health agencies. As these eHealth data can advance the modern health care system and make it smarter, many researchers want to use these data in their studies. However, using eHealth data brings about privacy and security concerns. The analytical environment that supports health care research must also consider many requirements. For these reasons, countries generally provide research platforms for health care, but some data providers (eg, patients) are still concerned about the security and privacy of their eHealth data. Thus, a more secure platform for health care research that guarantees the utility of eHealth data while focusing on its security and privacy is needed. This study aims to implement a research platform for health care called the health care big data platform (HBDP), which is more secure than previous health care research platforms. The HBDP uses attribute-based encryption to achieve fine-grained access control and encryption of stored eHealth data in an open environment. Moreover, in the HBDP, platform administrators can perform the appropriate follow-up (eg, block illegal users) and monitoring through a private blockchain. In other words, the HBDP supports accountability in access control. We first identified potential security threats in the health care domain. We then defined the security requirements to minimize the identified threats. In particular, the requirements were defined based on the security solutions used in existing health care research platforms. We then proposed the HBDP, which meets defined security requirements (ie, access control, encryption of stored eHealth data, and accountability). Finally, we implemented the HBDP to prove its feasibility. This study carried out case studies for illegal user detection via the implemented HBDP based on specific scenarios related to the threats. As a result, the platform detected illegal users appropriately via the security agent. Furthermore, in the empirical evaluation of massive data encryption (eg, 100,000 rows with 3 sensitive columns within 46 columns) for column-level encryption, full encryption after column-level encryption, and full decryption including column-level decryption, our approach achieved approximately 3 minutes, 1 minute, and 9 minutes, respectively. In the blockchain, average latencies and throughputs in 1Org with 2Peers reached approximately 18 seconds and 49 transactions per second (TPS) in read mode and approximately 4 seconds and 120 TPS in write mode in 300 TPS. The HBDP enables fine-grained access control and secure storage of eHealth data via attribute-based encryption cryptography. It also provides nonrepudiation and accountability through the blockchain. Therefore, we consider that our proposal provides a sufficiently secure environment for the use of eHealth data in health care research.",

There are relevant deontological (like obligations towards study participants and research sponsors) and consequentialist (harm for patients and misallocation of scarce resources) ethical reasons for the full publication of all trial results, which cannot be overridden by counter arguments like freedom of research, data protection or the individual interests of researchers and manufacturers. The article therefore discusses (1) which strategies are appropriate to guarantee data transparency and (2) who bears responsibility for the implementation of these strategies.

    "abstract": "The dissemination of electronic medical data among professional personnel has been perceived to be an important breakthrough for the discovery of new technologies and therapies for curing diseases. However, in the current medical data management, it is difficult to share medical data due to the fragmentation of medical data and the lack of effective sharing methods. On the other hand, the security of medical data is difficult to protect because the centralized data storage is vulnerable to attack and tampering. Therefore, we propose a model called Med-PPPHIS, which consists of a permission-less blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, named Med-DLattice, to serve the management of user's personal health information and form a chained protection mechanism for medical data. Med-DLattice features Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, where each account updates its Account-DAG asynchronously to other unrelated accounts. The Med-DLattice nodes can reach an efficient consensus with proposed DPoS-Quorum algorithm. Based on this model, by converting the medical data into on-chain tokens, a safe and efficient channel for data circulation is established, while the privacy of data is secured. We implement a prototype of Med-PPPHIS and introduce a blockchain-based closed-loop method for chronic disease management, which initially applies the model to national physique monitoring in Anhui Province, China. The performance of the model is evaluated by simulating 500 nodes on 25 AliCloud ECS virtual machines. Experimental result shows that Med-PPPHIS has low latency and high throughput, and the security analysis shows that the model is able to prevent Sybil attacks, DDoS attacks, etc.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring privacy and confidentiality in healthcare data management remains a critical challenge. Traditional centralized access control mechanisms are susceptible to security breaches, including unauthorized access, data leakage, and single points of failure, as well as privacy violations such as patient record exposure and improper data sharing. To address these issues, this paper proposes ACHealthChain, a blockchain-based framework leveraging Hyperledger Fabric for decentralized and transparent access control. The framework integrates the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage and ensures privacy through Hyperledger Fabric channels. ACHealthChain features PolicyChain for fine-grained access control and revocation, structuring patient health data into separate subchains for EHRs and diagnoses with permissioned access. Additionally, LogChain enhances auditing and accountability. A series of experiments evaluate ACHealthChain's performance and scalability, considering metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization. Results demonstrate that ACHealthChain improves throughput by 19.7% and reduces latency by 87%, outperforming existing frameworks built on the same platform. The scalability analysis further confirms the framework's capability to handle increasing workloads within an expanding blockchain network. ACHealthChain presents a promising solution for secure and efficient healthcare data sharing with potential real-world applications.",

    "title": "A detection method for android application security based on TF-IDF and machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Android is the most widely used mobile operating system (OS). A large number of third-party Android application (app) markets have emerged. The absence of third-party market regulation has prompted research institutions to propose different malware detection techniques. However, due to improvements of malware itself and Android system, it is difficult to design a detection method that can efficiently and effectively detect malicious apps for a long time. Meanwhile, adopting more features will increase the complexity of the model and the computational cost of the system. Permissions play a vital role in the security of the Android apps. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to assess the importance of a word for a file set in a corpus. The static analysis method does not need to run the app. It can efficiently and accurately extract the permissions from an app. Based on this cognition and perspective, in this paper, a new static detection method based on TF-IDF and Machine Learning is proposed. The system permissions are extracted in Android application package's (Apk's) manifest file. TF-IDF algorithm is used to calculate the permission value (PV) of each permission and the sensitivity value of apk (SVOA) of each app. The SVOA and the number of the used permissions are learned and tested by machine learning. 6070 benign apps and 9419 malware are used to evaluate the proposed approach. The experiment results show that only use dangerous permissions or the number of used permissions can't accurately distinguish whether an app is malicious or benign. For malware detection, the proposed approach achieve up to 99.5% accuracy and the learning and training time only needs 0.05s. For malware families detection, the accuracy is 99.6%. The results indicate that the method for unknown/new sample's detection accuracy is 92.71%. Compared against other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed approach is more effective by detecting malware and malware families.",

    "abstract": "An anonymous user authentication scheme allows a user, who wants to access a remote application server, to achieve mutual authentication and session key establishment with the server in an anonymous manner. To enhance the security of such authentication schemes, recent researches combined user's biometrics with a password. However, these authentication schemes are designed for single server environment. So when a user wants to access different application servers, the user has to register many times. To solve this problem, Chuang and Chen proposed an anonymous multiserver authenticated key agreement scheme using smart cards together with passwords and biometrics. Chuang and Chen claimed that their scheme not only supports multiple servers but also achieves various security requirements. However, we show that this scheme is vulnerable to a masquerade attack, a smart card attack, a user impersonation attack, and a DoS attack and does not achieve perfect forward secrecy. We also propose a security enhanced anonymous multiserver authenticated key agreement scheme which addresses all the weaknesses identified in Chuang and Chen's scheme.",

    "abstract": "In 2009, Lyubashevsky proposed a lattice-based signature scheme using the Schnorr-like identification and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and proved its security under the collision resistance of a generalized compact knapsack function. However, their security analysis requires the witness indistinguishability property, leading to significant inefficiency and an increase of sizes of public key and signature. To overcome the efficiency issue associated with the WI property, we introduce a new lattice-based assumption, called the target-modified one-wayness problem of the GCK function and show its reduction to well-known lattice-based problems. Additionally, we present a simple and efficient GCK-based signature scheme, GCKSign, whose security is based on the Module GCK-TMO problem in the random oracle model. GCKSign is a natural extension of Lyubashevsky's scheme in a module setting, but achieves considerable efficiency gains due to eliminating the witness indistinguishability property. As a result, GCKSign achieves approximately 3.4 times shorter signature size and 2.4 times shorter public key size at the same security level.",

    "title": "Do privacy and security regulations need a status update? Perspectives from an intergenerational survey.",
    "abstract": "The importance of health privacy protections in the era of the \"Facebook Generation\" has been called into question. The ease with which younger people share personal information about themselves has led to the assumption that they are less concerned than older generations about the privacy of their information, including health information. We explored whether survey respondents' views toward health privacy suggest that efforts to strengthen privacy protections as health information is moved online are unnecessary. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), which is well-known for recruitment for survey research, we distributed a 45-item survey to individuals in the U.S. to assess their perspectives toward privacy and security of online and health information, social media behaviors, use of health and fitness devices, and demographic information. 1310 participants (mean age: 36 years, 50% female, 78% non-Hispanic white, 54% college graduates or higher) were categorized by generations: Millennials, Generation X, and Baby Boomers. In multivariate regression models, we found that generational cohort was an independent predictor of level of concern about privacy and security of both online and health information. Younger generations were significantly less likely to be concerned than older generations (all P < 0.05). Time spent online and social media use were not predictors of level of concern about privacy or security of online or health information (all P > 0.05). This study is limited by the non-representativeness of our sample. Though Millennials reported lower levels of concern about privacy and security, this was not related to internet or social media behaviors, and majorities within all generations reported concern about both the privacy and security of their health information. Thus, there is no intergenerational imperative to relax privacy and security standards, and it would be advisable to take privacy and security of health information more seriously.",

    "title": "Anonymity in EU Health Law: Not an Alternative to Information Governance.",
    "abstract": "Data sharing has long been a cornerstone of healthcare and research and is only due to become more important with the rise of Big Data analytics and advanced therapies. Cell therapies, for example, rely not only on donated cells but also essentially on donated information to make them traceable. Despite the associated importance of concepts such as 'donor anonymity', the concept of anonymisation remains contentious. The Article 29 Working Party's 2014 guidance on 'Anonymisation Techniques' has perhaps helped encourage a perception that anonymity is the result of data modification 'techniques', rather than a broader process involving management of information and context. In light of this enduring ambiguity, this article advocates a 'relative' understanding of anonymity and supports this interpretation with reference not only to the General Data Protection Regulation but also to European Union health-related legislation, which also alludes to the concept. Anonymity, I suggest, should be understood not as a 'technique' which removes the need for information governance but rather as a legal standard of reasonable risk-management, which can only be satisfied by effective data protection. As such, anonymity can be not so much an alternative to data protection as its mirror, requiring similar safeguards to maintain privacy and confidentiality.",

    "abstract": "Re-use of patients' health records can provide tremendous benefits for clinical research. Yet, when researchers need to access sensitive/identifying data, such as genomic data, in order to compile cohorts of well-characterized patients for specific studies, privacy and security concerns represent major obstacles that make such a procedure extremely difficult if not impossible. In this paper, we address the challenge of designing and deploying in a real operational setting an efficient privacy-preserving explorer for genetic cohorts. Our solution is built on top of the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) framework and leverages cutting-edge privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Solutions involving homomorphic encryption are often believed to be costly and immature for use in operational environments. Here, we show that, for specific applications, homomorphic encryption is actually a very efficient enabler. Indeed, our solution outperforms prior work by enabling a researcher to securely compute simple statistics on more than 3,000 encrypted genetic variants simultaneously for a cohort of 5,000 individuals in less than 5 seconds with commodity hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our privacy-preserving solution is the first to also be successfully deployed and tested in a operation setting (Lausanne University Hospital).",

    "abstract": "As a direct result of advancements in digital technology and the Internet, the copyright protection and information integrity of multimedia that are being published across the Internet have emerged as a major and urgent issue that needs to be addressed. The technique of digital watermarking may be used to protect intellectual property. In terms of authentication, resilience, storage, and capacity of digital watermarking information, there is still room for development. Blockchain's potential in video copyright protection and management applications has motivated researchers. Copyright owners and consumers may now communicate directly via copyright protection apps built on the blockchain, eliminating the need for distributers and the associated fees. Nonetheless, the current blockchain-based video watermarking solutions require storing a significant number of coordinates depending on the watermark size and are susceptible to video frame attacks on the video frame texture region. This study proposes an enhanced video copyright management approach that incorporates digital watermarking, the blockchain, and a perceptual hash function. Watermark information is stored on a blockchain structure, which also acts as a timestamp for verification purposes. To verify watermark data without the source video, a perceptual hash function is employed to compute a hash value based on the structural information of video frames. The contribution is in learning how to extract a hash function from a small number of video frames that still adequately represent a large amount of video content while also reducing the number of unnecessary video frames and the amount of computation required to summarize and index that content in a blockchain. This expedites the dissemination of copyrighted works and increases their security and readability, hence facilitating their circulation on the Internet. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach is memory efficient, as it only needs to store one key for each key frame, regardless of the size of the watermark. Additionally, the overall robustness is greatly improved by using the blockchain's random hash function. Therefore, new and important advancements in video watermarking have been realized because of this effort.",

    "abstract": "This review examines the potential of blockchain technology to improve cancer treatment infrastructure by addressing inefficiencies in current IT systems. It suggests that blockchain can resolve interoperability issues, enhance data quality, and improve communication among healthcare stakeholders. By utilizing blockchain's decentralization, transparency, and security features, a blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system can enable real-time data sharing, improve patient care coordination, and build trust within the cancer care continuum. The review also discusses the scalability of blockchain solutions, which is essential for accommodating various healthcare providers, facilitating seamless information exchange, and ensuring continuity of care. Additionally, it highlights blockchain's ability to bolster clinical research by providing a secure, immutable ledger for data collection, potentially speeding up the approval of new therapies. Ethical considerations related to patient consent and data ownership are addressed, emphasizing the importance of empowering patients to control their health information. Furthermore, blockchain integration can streamline billing and insurance processes, alleviating administrative burdens on healthcare providers. Ultimately, the review emphasizes that incorporating blockchain technology into cancer treatment infrastructure is vital for creating a more efficient, integrated, and patient-centered healthcare system, addressing current challenges in cancer care while promoting collaboration, enhancing data integrity, and empowering patients.",

    "abstract": "Genetic information is unique among all laboratory data because it not only informs the current health of the specific person tested but may also be predictive of the future health of the individual and, to varying degrees, all biological relatives. As DNA sequencing has become ubiquitous with decreasing cost, large repositories of genomic data have emerged from the domains of research, healthcare, law enforcement, international security, and recreational consumer interest (i.e., genealogy). Broadly shared genomic data are believed to be a key element for future discoveries in human disease. For example, the National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons is designed to promote cancer research discoveries by providing free access to the genome data sets of 12000 cancer patients. However, in parallel with the promise of curing diseases, genomic data also have the potential for harm. Genomic data that are deidentified by standard healthcare practices (e.g., removal of name, date of birth) can be reidentified by methods that combine genomic software with publicly available demographic databases (e.g., phone book). Recent law enforcement cases (i.e., Bear Brook Murders, Golden State Killer) in the US have demonstrated the power of combining DNA profiles with genealogy databases. We examine the current environment of genomic privacy and confidentiality in the US and describe current and future risks to genomic privacy. Reidentification and inference of genetic information of biological relatives will become more important as larger databases of clinical, criminal, and recreational genomic information are developed over the next decade.",

    "abstract": "Privacy is a major concern in sharing human subject data to researchers for secondary analyses. A simple binary consent (opt-in or not) may significantly reduce the amount of sharable data, since many patients might only be concerned about a few sensitive medical conditions rather than the entire medical records. We propose event-level privacy protection, and develop a feature ablation method to protect event-level privacy in electronic medical records. Using a list of 13 sensitive diagnoses, we evaluate the feasibility and the efficacy of the proposed method. As feature ablation progresses, the identifiability of a sensitive medical condition decreases with varying speeds on different diseases. We find that these sensitive diagnoses can be divided into three categories: (1) five diseases have fast declining identifiability (AUC below 0.6 with less than 400 features excluded); (2) seven diseases with progressively declining identifiability (AUC below 0.7 with between 200 and 700 features excluded); and (3) one disease with slowly declining identifiability (AUC above 0.7 with 1,000 features excluded). The fact that the majority (12 out of 13) of the sensitive diseases fall into the first two categories suggests the potential of the proposed feature ablation method as a solution for event-level record privacy protection.",

It has the characteristics of intelligence, networking and high precision. It has been widely used in aerospace, aviation, intelligent transportation, industrial control and medical and health care. However, in some specific application scenarios with high data security requirements and low transmission delay, such as environmental detection, transportation, etc., smart sensors have three obvious shortcomings. First, the data transmission delay is high. Second, the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmission process cannot be effectively guaranteed. Third, centralized data storage is easily leaked and tampered with by malicious users and semi-trusted administrators. Therefore, a 5G-based blockchain smart sensor 5G-BSS was designed. 5G-BSS has three innovation points. First, the 5G communication module enables the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The 5G communication module is integrated into the smart sensor 5G-BSS to reduce the delay of data transmission and improve the speed and reliability of data transmission. Second, cryptographic algorithms enable the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The data encryption module of the smart sensor 5G-BSS improves the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmission process. Third, blockchain empowers the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The blockchain client is integrated into the smart sensor 5G-BSS to ensure the centralized storage of data and prevent data leakage and tampering by semi-trusted administrators. The operation process of the hardware and software architecture is described in detail and tested on the Fisco-Bcos. The experimental results show that 5G-BSS not only has fast data transmission speed but also can effectively guarantee the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data. 5G-BSS is suitable for application scenarios with high requirements for data security and data transmission, such as environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving, etc.",

To improve the effectiveness of the intrusion detection rate, this paper proposes a hybrid intrusion detection method that utilizes ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic) and the decision tree based on ID3 algorithm. At first, the intrusion detection dataset is transformed by coding technology and normalized. Subsequently, the ADASYN algorithm is applied to implement oversampling on the training set, and the ID3 algorithm is employed to build a decision tree model. In addition, the model proposed by the research is evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, and false alarm rate. Besides, a performance comparison is conducted with other models. Consequently, it is found that the combined model based on ADASYN and ID3 decision tree proposed in this research possesses higher accuracy as well as lower false alarm rate, which is more suitable for intrusion detection tasks.",

    "title": "Secure Obfuscation for Encrypted Group Signatures.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, group signature techniques are widely used in constructing privacy-preserving security schemes for various information systems. However, conventional techniques keep the schemes secure only in normal black-box attack contexts. In other words, these schemes suppose that (the implementation of) the group signature generation algorithm is running in a platform that is perfectly protected from various intrusions and attacks. As a complementary to existing studies, how to generate group signatures securely in a more austere security context, such as a white-box attack context, is studied in this paper. We use obfuscation as an approach to acquire a higher level of security. Concretely, we introduce a special group signature functionality-an encrypted group signature, and then provide an obfuscator for the proposed functionality. A series of new security notions for both the functionality and its obfuscator has been introduced. The most important one is the average-case secure virtual black-box property w.r.t. dependent oracles and restricted dependent oracles which captures the requirement of protecting the output of the proposed obfuscator against collision attacks from group members. The security notions fit for many other specialized obfuscators, such as obfuscators for identity-based signatures, threshold signatures and key-insulated signatures. Finally, the correctness and security of the proposed obfuscator have been proven. Thereby, the obfuscated encrypted group signature functionality can be applied to variants of privacy-preserving security schemes and enhance the security level of these schemes.",

    "abstract": "Breach of confidentiality or invasion of privacy from the collection and use of medical records, particularly those of patients with HIV/AIDS or other diseases sensitive to stigmatization, should be prevented by all related stakeholders in healthcare settings. The main focus of this study was to assess practices regarding security and confidentiality of HIV-related information among staff at HIV outpatient clinics (HIV-OPCs) in Vietnam. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at all 312 HIV-OPCs across the country using an online survey technique. In general, the staff practices for securing and protecting patient information were at acceptable levels. Most staff had proper measures and practices for maintaining data security; however, the protection of patient confidentiality, particularly for data access, sharing, and transfer still required improvement. Most HIV-OPC staff had good or moderate knowledge and positive perceptions towards security and confidentiality issues. Staff who were not trained in the practice of security measures differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 3.74; 95%CI: 1.44-9.67); staff needing improved knowledge levels differed significantly from those with good (OR: 5.20; 95%CI: 2.39-11.32) and moderate knowledge levels (OR: 5.10; 95%CI: 2.36-11.00); and staff needing improved perception levels differed significantly from those with good (i.e., with 100% proper practices) and moderate perception levels (OR: 5.67; 95%CI: 2.93-10.95). Staff who were not trained in the protection of data confidentiality differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.29-3.65). Training is an important factor to help raise the levels of proper practices regarding confidentiality and security, to improve knowledge and raise awareness about change among staff. The operation and management of HIV treatment and care in Vietnam are currently transitioning from separate healthcare clinics (HIV-OPC) into units integrated into general hospitals/healthcare facilities. The findings of this study highlight topics that could be used for improving management and operation of information system and revising guidelines and regulations on protection measures/strategies for data security and confidentiality of HIV/AIDS patients by Vietnam health authorities or other countries facing similar situations. Secure infrastructure and secure measures for data access and use are very important, worthwhile investments. The provision of continuous training and active enforcement and monitoring of the practices of healthcare personnel might lead to an improved understanding and acknowledegement of the importance of national policies/guidelines regarding HIV-related patient information.",

    "title": "Improving Diagnosis Through Digital Pathology: Proof-of-Concept Implementation Using Smart Contracts and Decentralized File Storage.",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in digital pathology resulting from advances in imaging and digitization have increased the convenience and usability of pathology for disease diagnosis, especially in oncology, urology, and gastroenteric diagnosis. However, despite the possibilities to include low-cost diagnosis and viable telemedicine, digital pathology is not yet accessible owing to expensive storage, data security requirements, and network bandwidth limitations to transfer high-resolution images and associated data. The increase in storage, transmission, and security complexity concerning data collection and diagnosis makes it even more challenging to use artificial intelligence algorithms for machine-assisted disease diagnosis. We designed and prototyped a digital pathology system that uses blockchain-based smart contracts using the nonfungible token (NFT) standard and the Interplanetary File System for data storage. Our design remediates shortcomings in the existing digital pathology systems infrastructure, which is centralized. The proposed design is extendable to other fields of medicine that require high-fidelity image and data storage. Our solution is implemented in data systems that can improve access quality of care and reduce the cost of access to specialized pathological diagnosis, reducing cycle times for diagnosis. The main objectives of this study are to highlight the issues in digital pathology and suggest that a software architecture-based blockchain and the Interplanetary File System create a low-cost data storage and transmission technology. We used the design science research method consisting of 6 stages to inform our design overall. We innovated over existing public-private designs for blockchains but using a 2-layered approach that separates actual file storage from metadata and data persistence. Here, we identified key challenges to adopting digital pathology, including challenges concerning long-term storage and the transmission of information. Next, using accepted frameworks in NFT-based intelligent contracts and recent innovations in distributed secure storage, we proposed a decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving digital pathology system. Our design and prototype implementation using Solidity, web3.js, Ethereum, and node.js helped us address several challenges facing digital pathology. We demonstrated how our solution, which combines NFT smart contract standard with persistent decentralized file storage, solves most of the challenges of digital pathology and sets the stage for reducing costs and improving patient care and speed of diagnosis. We identified technical limitations that increase costs and reduce the mass adoption of digital pathology. We presented several design innovations using NFT decentralized storage standards to prototype a system. We also presented the implementation details of a unique security architecture for a digital pathology system. We illustrated how this design can overcome privacy, security, network-based storage, and data transmission limitations. We illustrated how improving these factors sets the stage for improving data quality and standardized application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to such data.",

    "title": "Why Employees (Still) Click on Phishing Links: Investigation in Hospitals.",
    "abstract": "Hospitals have been one of the major targets for phishing attacks. Despite efforts to improve information security compliance, hospitals still significantly suffer from such attacks, impacting the quality of care and the safety of patients. This study aimed to investigate why hospital employees decide to click on phishing emails by analyzing actual clicking data. We first gauged the factors that influence clicking behavior using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and integrating trust theories. We then conducted a survey in hospitals and used structural equation modeling to investigate the components of compliance intention. We matched employees' survey results with their actual clicking data from phishing campaigns. Our analysis (N=397) reveals that TPB factors (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control), as well as collective felt trust and trust in information security technology, are positively related to compliance intention. However, compliance intention is not significantly related to compliance behavior. Only the level of employees' workload is positively associated with the likelihood of employees clicking on a phishing link. This is one of the few studies in information security and decision making that observed compliance behavior by analyzing clicking data rather than using self-reported data. We show that, in the context of phishing emails, intention and compliance might not be as strongly linked as previously assumed; hence, hospitals must remain vigilant with vulnerabilities that cannot be easily managed. Importantly, given the significant association between workload and noncompliance behavior (ie, clicking on phishing links), hospitals should better manage employees' workload to increase information security. Our findings can help health care organizations augment employees' compliance with their cybersecurity policies and reduce the likelihood of clicking on phishing links.",

    "abstract": "Due to the competitive relationship among different smart factories, equipment manufacturers cannot integrate the private information of all smart factories to train the intelligent manufacturing equipment fault prediction model and improve the accuracy of intelligent manufacturing equipment fault detection. The use of a low fault recognition rate model for smart factories will cause additional losses for them. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based privacy information security sharing scheme in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to solve the sharing problem of private information in smart factories. Firstly, we abstract smart factories as edge nodes and build decentralized, distributed trusted blockchain networks based on Ethereum clients on simulated edge devices and propose an Intelligent Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (IECDSA) to guarantee the ownership of shared information by edge nodes. Secondly, we propose the Reputation-based Delegated Proof of Stake (RDPoS) consensus algorithm to improve the security and reliability of the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. Furthermore, we design and implement an incentive mechanism based on information attributes to increase the motivation of edge nodes to share information. Finally, the proposed solution is simulated. Through theoretical and simulation experiments, it is proved that the blockchain-based privacy information security sharing scheme in IIoT can improve the enthusiasm of edge nodes to share information on the premise of ensuring the security of information sharing.",

    "abstract": "The elastic and inexpensive computing resources such as clouds have been recognized as a useful solution to analyzing massive human genomic data (e.g., acquired by using next-generation sequencers) in biomedical researches. However, outsourcing human genome computation to public or commercial clouds was hindered due to privacy concerns: even a small number of human genome sequences contain sufficient information for identifying the donor of the genomic data. This issue cannot be directly addressed by existing security and cryptographic techniques (such as homomorphic encryption), because they are too heavyweight to carry out practical genome computation tasks on massive data. In this article, we present a secure algorithm to accomplish the read mapping, one of the most basic tasks in human genomic data analysis based on a hybrid cloud computing model. Comparing with the existing approaches, our algorithm delegates most computation to the public cloud, while only performing encryption and decryption on the private cloud, and thus makes the maximum use of the computing resource of the public cloud. Furthermore, our algorithm reports similar results as the nonsecure read mapping algorithms, including the alignment between reads and the reference genome, which can be directly used in the downstream analysis such as the inference of genomic variations. We implemented the algorithm in C++ and Python on a hybrid cloud system, in which the public cloud uses an Apache Spark system.",

    "abstract": "Patient tokenization is a novel approach that allows anonymous patient-level linkage across healthcare facilities, minimizing the risk of breaching protected health information in health information exchange (HIE). Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE.",

This article presents the results of a systematic literature review regarding frequently adopted security and privacy technical features of EHR systems. Our inclusion criteria were full articles that dealt with the security and privacy of technical implementations of EHR systems published in English in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings between 1998 and 2013; 55 selected studies were reviewed in detail. We analysed the review results using two International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards (29100 and 27002) in order to consolidate the study findings. Using this process, we identified 13 features that are essential to security and privacy in EHRs. These included system and application access control, compliance with security requirements, interoperability, integration and sharing, consent and choice mechanism, policies and regulation, applicability and scalability and cryptography techniques. This review highlights the importance of technical features, including mandated access control policies and consent mechanisms, to provide patients' consent, scalability through proper architecture and frameworks, and interoperability of health information systems, to EHR security and privacy requirements.",

No institutional review board approval was needed for this project, which involved no patient subjects. Two Google searches, each limited to PowerPoint files, were performed by using the criteria \"Cardiac CT\" and \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\" The first 100 hits of each search were downloaded from the source Web site. The presentations were examined for the PHI contained on any images, links, or notes pages. Two hundred presentations were evaluated. There were 143 presentations with images, image links, or notes, and 52 (36%) of these contained PHI. There were 129 presentations containing radiologic images; 51 (40%) of these contained PHI, and 31 (24%) showed the patient's name. At least 132 (66%) of the 200 presentations originated from the United States. Thirty-five (37%) of 94 presentations with images, image links, or notes contained PHI. Eighty-six U.S. presentations contained radiologic images; 34 (40%) of these contained PHI, and 19 (22%) showed the patient's name. Online or other distributions of PowerPoint presentations that contain radiologic images often contain PHI, and this may violate laws, including the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.",

This paper identifies the privacy challenges posed by e-health records and the importance of proper safeguards to protect this information. The draft Code, including a number of unresolved problems underpinning its implementation, is discussed. Although a stakeholder consultation process has been undertaken, it is argued that further debate and development is required before such an untested and fundamental change to Australia's health privacy framework can be effectively implemented.",

    "abstract": "With the establishment of the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) as a distributed business process engine in German research networks, it is becoming increasingly important to coordinate authentication, authorization, and role information between peer-to-peer network components. This information is provided in the form of an allowlist. This paper presents a concept and implementation of an Allowlist Management Application. In research networks using the DSF, allowlists were initially generated manually. The Allowlist Management Application provides comprehensive tool support for the participating organizations and the administrators of the Allowlist Management Application. It automates the process of creating and distributing allowlists and additionally reduces errors associated with manual entries. In addition, security is improved through extensive validation of entries and enforcing review of requested changes by implementing a four-eyes principle. Our implementation serves as a preliminary development for the complete automation of onboarding and allowlist management processes using established frontend and backend frameworks. The application has been deployed in the Medical Informatics Initiative and the Network University Medicine with over 40 participating organizations. We learned the need for user guidance, unstructured communication in a structured tool, generalizability, and checks to ensure that the tool's outputs have actually been applied.",

To accommodate this reality, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). While final guidance has not fully been resolved at this time, it is up to the health care community to develop and implement comprehensive security strategies founded on procedural, hardware and software solutions in preparation for future controls. The Virtual Radiology Environment (VRE) Project, a landmark US Army picture archiving and communications system (PACS) implemented across 10 geographically dispersed medical facilities, has addressed that challenge by planning for the secure transmission of medical images and reports over their local (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) infrastructure. Their model, which is transferable to general PACS implementations, encompasses a strategy of application risk and dataflow identification, data auditing, security policy definition, and procedural controls. When combined with hardware and software solutions that are both non-performance limiting and scalable, the comprehensive approach will not only sufficiently address the current security requirements, but also accommodate the natural evolution of the enterprise security model.",

The paper covers three interconnected issues in the context of the use of administrative health data for research purposes - anonymization of data, concept of 'public interest' and involvement of research ethics committees. The analysis has been put into broader context of interaction between General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), national legislative measures and practical needs of researchers. Neither GDPR, nor Latvian legal framework regulate the particularities on the use of potentially identifiable health data in research. Also, the practical use of 'public interest' as a basis for lawful processing of personal data concerning health for research purposes is not clear. More extended involvement of research ethics committees might serve as useful tool for determination the 'public interest' and for the evaluation of proportionality when balancing the aims of the research and the personal data protection.",

    "title": "Privacy and artificial intelligence: challenges for protecting health information in a new era.",
    "abstract": "Advances in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) are occurring rapidly and there is a growing discussion about managing its development. Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public-private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship. We are currently in a familiar situation in which regulation and oversight risk falling behind the technologies they govern. Regulation should emphasize patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection.",

First, an impulsive inequality involving infinite delay is introduced and the asymptotic behaviour of its solution is investigated by the truncation method. Then, global exponential stability in the mean-square sense of the stochastic impulsive reaction-diffusion system is studied by constructing a simple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional where the S-type distributed delay is handled by the impulsive inequality. Numerical examples are also given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are successfully applied to an image encryption scheme based on bit-level permutation and the stochastic neural networks.",

This is a consequence of increasingly demanding and complex regulatory requirements from Health Authorities, aimed at a better understanding of the medical device safety evaluation. Proactive approaches to PMS processes are becoming more necessary as regulators increase the scrutiny of device safety. New technologies have been explored to address some of the challenges associated with this changing regulatory environment. This paper focuses on the different technical aspects of blockchain and how this new technology has the potential to support the ongoing efforts to improve the PMS system for medical devices. To address these challenges, we suggest to generate a private PMS data permissioned blockchain with a proof-of-authority consensus mechanism, to which only a restricted number of designated and audited participants have authorization to validate transactions and add them to the PMS data blockchain ledger. Blockchain has the potential to support a more efficient approach, which could offer many advantages to the different stakeholders involved in the PMS process, such as supporting with new regulatory initiatives.",

In this paper we suggest that critical theory can facilitate a better understanding of possible ethical issues and can provide support when finding ways of addressing them. The paper argues that critical theory has intrinsic links to ethics and that it is possible to identify concepts frequently used in critical theory to pinpoint ethical concerns. Using the example of UK electronic medical records the paper demonstrates that a critical lens can highlight issues that traditional ethical theories tend to overlook. These are often linked to collective issues such as social and organisational structures, which philosophical ethics with its typical focus on the individual does not tend to emphasise. The paper suggests that this insight can help in developing ways of researching and innovating responsibly in the area of information security.",

    "title": "Evaluation of the awareness and effectiveness of IT security programs in a large publicly funded health care system.",
    "abstract": "Electronic health records are becoming increasingly common in the health care industry. Although information technology (IT) poses many benefits to improving health care and ease of access to information, there are also security and privacy risks. Educating health care providers is necessary to ensure proper use of health information systems and IT and reduce undesirable outcomes. This study evaluated employees' awareness and perceptions of the effectiveness of two IT educational training modules within a large publicly funded health care system in Canada. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups included a variety of professional roles within the organisation. Participants also completed a brief demographic data sheet. With the consent of participants, all interviews and focus groups were audio recorded. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the IT security training modules. Five main themes emerged: (i) awareness of the IT training modules, (ii) the content of modules, (iii) staff perceptions about differences between IT security and privacy issues, (iv) common breaches of IT security and privacy, and (v) challenges and barriers to completing the training program. Overall, nonclinical staff were more likely to be aware of the training modules than were clinical staff. We found e-learning was a feasible way to educate a large number of employees. However, health care providers required a module on IT security and privacy that was relatable and applicable to their specific roles. Strategies to improve staff education and mitigate against IT security and privacy risks are discussed. Future research should focus on integrating health IT competencies into the educational programs for health care professionals.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain in healthcare applications requires robust security and privacy mechanism for high-level authentication, interoperability and medical records sharing to comply with the strict legal requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Blockchain technology in the healthcare industry has received considerable research attention in recent years. This study conducts a review to substantially analyse and map the research landscape of current technologies, mainly the use of blockchain in healthcare applications, into a coherent taxonomy. The present study systematically searches all relevant research articles on blockchain in healthcare applications in three accessible databases, namely, ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science, by using the defined keywords 'blockchain', 'healthcare' and 'electronic health records' and their variations. The final set of collected articles related to the use of blockchain in healthcare application is divided into three categories. The first category includes articles (i.e. 43/58 scientific articles) that attempted to develop and design healthcare applications integrating blockchain, particularly those on new architecture, system designs, framework, scheme, model, platform, approach, protocol and algorithm. The second category includes studies (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) that attempted to evaluate and analyse the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare system. Finally, the third category comprises review and survey articles (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) related to the integration of blockchain into healthcare applications. The final articles for review are discussed on the basis of five aspects: (1) year of publication, (2) nationality of authors, (3) publishing house or journal, (4) purpose of using blockchain in health applications and the corresponding contributions and problem types and proposed solutions. Additionally, this study provides identified motivations, open challenges and recommendations on the use of blockchain in healthcare applications. The current research contributes to the literature by providing a detailed review of feasible alternatives and identifying the research gaps. Accordingly, researchers and developers are provided with appealing opportunities to further develop decentralised healthcare applications through a comprehensive discussion of about the importance of blockchain and its integration into various healthcare applications.",

    "title": "A Selective Group Authentication Scheme for IoT-Based Medical Information System.",
    "abstract": "The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "To protect patient privacy and ensure authorized access to remote medical services, many remote user authentication schemes for the integrated electronic patient record (EPR) information system have been proposed in the literature. In a recent paper, Das proposed a hash based remote user authentication scheme using passwords and smart cards for the integrated EPR information system, and claimed that the proposed scheme could resist various passive and active attacks. However, in this paper, we found that Das's authentication scheme is still vulnerable to modification and user duplication attacks. Thereafter we propose a secure and efficient authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system based on lightweight hash function and bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operations. The security proof and performance analysis show our new scheme is well-suited to adoption in remote medical healthcare services.",

In this paper, a quantum signature scheme using amplitude amplification techniques will be proposed. To secure the signature, the proposed scheme uses a partial diffusion operator and a diffusion operator to hide/unhide certain quantum states during communication. The proposed scheme consists of three phases, preparation phase, signature phase and verification phase. To confuse the eavesdropper, the quantum states representing the signature might be hidden, not hidden or encoded in Bell states. It will be shown that the proposed scheme is more secure against eavesdropping when compared with relevant quantum signature schemes.",

    "abstract": "With the electric power grid experiencing a rapid shift to the smart grid paradigm over a deregulated energy market, Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are gaining prominence and innovative Peer To Peer (P2P) energy trading at micro-level are being deployed. Such advancement, however leave traditional security models vulnerable and pave the path for Blockchain, an Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with its decentralized, open and transparency characteristics as a viable alternative. However, due to deregulation in energy trading markets, massive volumes of micro transactions are required to be supported, which become a performance bottleneck with existing Blockchain solution such as Hyperledger, Ethereum and so on. In this paper, a lightweight 'Tangle' based framework, namely IOTA (Third generation DLT) is employed for designing an energy trading market that uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based solution that not only alleviates the reward overhead for micro-transactions but also provides scalability, quantum-proof, and high throughput of such transactions at low confirmation latency. Furthermore the Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) protocol is used over the IOTA P2P energy trading framework that allows energy producer and consumer to share the data while maintaining the confidentiality, and facilitates the data accessibility. The Raspberry Pi 3 board along with voltage sensor (INA219) used for the setting up light node and publishing and fetching data from the Tangle. The results of the obtained benchmarking indicate low confirmation latency, high throughput, system with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Moreover, the effect of transaction rate decreases when the IOTA bundle size increases more than 10. For bundle size 5 and 10 it behaves absolutely better than any other platform. The speedy confirmation time of transactions in IOTA, is most suitable for peer to peer energy trading scenarios. This study serves as a guideline for deploying, end-to-end transaction with IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and improving the performance of Blockchain in the energy sector under various operating conditions.",

To improve the security and performance of the directed signature scheme, Gayathri et al. proposed the first certificateless directed signature (CLDS) scheme without bilinear pairing and claimed that their CLDS scheme could withstand Type I and Type II attacks. In this article, we provide two attack methods to assess the security of their CLDS scheme. Unfortunately, our results indicate that their CLDS scheme is insecure against Type I and Type II attacks. That is, their CLDS scheme does not meet the unforgeability and cannot achieve the expected security goals. To resist these attacks, we present an improved CLDS scheme and give the security proof. Compared with similar schemes, our scheme has better performance and higher security.",

    "abstract": "Under the current national network environment, anyone can participate in publishing. As an important information resource, knowledge files reflect the workload of publishers. Moreover, high-quality knowledge files can promote the progress of society. However, pirated inferior files have the opposite effect. At present, most organizations use centralized servers to centrally manage the knowledge files released by users. In addition, it is necessary to introduce an untrusted third party to examine and encrypt the contents of files, which leads to an opaque process of file storage transactions, tampering with intellectual copyright, and the inability to have consistent systems of file management among institutions due to the lack of uniform standards for the same intellectual files. The purpose of this paper is to ensure the safe storage of knowledge files on the one hand and to realize efficient sharing of copyrighted files on the other hand. Therefore, this paper combines NDN (Named Data Network) technology with a distributed blockchain and an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and proposes a blockchain knowledge file storage and sharing method based on an NDN. The method uses the NDN itself for the file content signature and encryption, thereby separating the file security and transmission process. At the same time, the method uses a flexible NDN reverse path forwarding and routing strategy, combining an IPFS private storage network to improve the safety of the encrypted data storage security. Finally, the method takes advantage of all participating nodes consensus and shares files in the synchronized blockchain to ensure traceability. This paper introduces the structure and principles of the method and describes the process of file upload and transfer. Finally, the performance of the method is compared and evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method and the future research direction are summarized.",

    "abstract": "Since August 2018, Irish health research is regulated by the European General Data Protection Act (GDPR) 2016 with the (Irish) Data Protection Act and Health Research Regulations (HRR) 2018. The Irish application of GDPR has been criticised by consultants and academics as overly restrictive; however, Non-consultant Hospital Doctor's (NCHD's) perspectives have not been explored. This project aimed to collect the views of NCHDs in Ireland in relation to health research and the impact of GDPR and HRR. Internationally barriers to engagement with health research have been identified; however, to our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted in Ireland. Agreeable Irish specialty colleges and faculties distributed an online survey to their NCHDs. Social media platforms were also used to promote the survey. All data collected was anonymised. A total of 192 NCHDs completed the survey; respondents included doctors from 13 specialties, with representation from each NCHD grade. Ninety-nine percent had previously participated in research, and 87% acknowledged the importance for doctors to be involved in research. Forty-four percent of NCHDs stated they would consider travelling abroad to complete research. Eighty-six percent agreed training relating to the new regulations would be useful; however, only 25% had received training. Our results confirm that NCHDs in Ireland are enthusiastic about engaging in research. The majority acknowledge the value of research in career development. Engaging in research abroad could be further explored as a factor impacting emigration. Our findings show that NCHDs in Ireland are concerned about the impact of GDPR and HRR and are seeking further training.",

Data breach data were merged with the Medicare Compare data for years 2012-2016, yielding a panel of 3025 hospitals with 14 297 unique hospital-year observations. The relationship between breach remediation and hospital quality was estimated using a difference-in-differences regression. Hospital quality was measured by 30-day acute myocardial infarction mortality rate and time from door to electrocardiogram. Hospital time-to-electrocardiogram increased as much as 2.7 minutes and 30-day acute myocardial infarction mortality increased as much as 0.36 percentage points during the 3-year window following a breach. Breach remediation efforts were associated with deterioration in timeliness of care and patient outcomes. Thus, breached hospitals and HHS oversight should carefully evaluate remedial security initiatives to achieve better data security without negatively affecting patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Blockchain Enabled Anonymous Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Internet of Health Things.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) has emerged as an attractive networking paradigm in wireless communications, integrated devices and embedded system technologies. In the IoHT, real-time health data are collected through smart healthcare sensors and, in recent years, the IoHT has started to have an important role in the Internet of Things technology. Although the IoHT provides comfort in health monitoring, it also imposes security challenges in maintaining patient data confidentiality and privacy. To overcome such security issues, in this paper, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication scheme is proposed as an approach for achieving efficient authentication of the patient without the involvement of a trusted entity. Moreover, a secure handover authentication mechanism that ensures avoiding the patient re-authentication in multi-doctor communication scenarios and revoking the possible malicious misbehavior of medical professionals in the IoHT communication with the patient is developed. The performance of the proposed authentication and handover scheme is analyzed concerning the existing state-of-the-art authentication schemes. The results of the performance analyses reveal that the proposed authentication scheme is resistant to different types of security attacks. Moreover, the results of analyses show that the proposed authentication scheme outperforms similar state-of-the-art authentication schemes in terms of having lower computational, communication and storage costs. Therefore, the novel authentication and handover scheme has proven practical applicability and represents a valuable contribution to improving the security of communication in IoHT networks.",

    "title": "A Permissioned Blockchain Network for Security and Sharing of De-identified Tuberculosis Research Data in Brazil.",
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and is among the top 10 causes of death in the world, and Brazil is part of the top 30 high TB burden countries. Data collection is an essential practice in health studies, and the adoption of electronic data capture (EDC) systems can positively increase the experience of data acquisition and analysis. Also, data-sharing capabilities are crucial to the construction of efficient and effective evidence-based decision-making tools for managerial and operational actions in TB services. Data must be held secure and traceable, as well as available and understandable, for authorized parties. In this sense, this work aims to propose a blockchain-based approach to build a reusable, decentralized, and de-identified dataset of TB research data, while increasing transparency, accountability, availability, and integrity of raw data collected in EDC systems. After identifying challenges and gaps, a solution was proposed to tackle them, considering its relevance for TB studies. Data security issues are being addressed by a blockchain network and a lightweight and practical governance model. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and KoBoToolbox are used as EDC systems in TB research. Mechanisms to de-identify data and aggregate semantics to data are also available. A permissioned blockchain network was built using Kaleido platform. An integration engine integrates the EDC systems with the blockchain network, performing de-identification and aggregating meaning to data. A governance model addresses operational and legal issues for the proper use of data. Finally, a management system facilitates the handling of necessary metadata, and additional applications are available to explore the blockchain and export data. Research data are an important asset not only for the research where it was generated, but also to underpin studies replication and support further investigations. The proposed solution allows the delivery of de-identified databases built in real time by storing data in transactions of a permissioned network, including semantic annotations, as data are being collected in TB research. The governance model promotes the correct use of the solution.",

    "title": "GEN-RWD Sandbox: bridging the gap between hospital data privacy and external research insights with distributed analytics.",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a pivotal tool in advancing contemporary personalised medicine, with the goal of tailoring treatments to individual patient conditions. This has heightened the demand for access to diverse data from clinical practice and daily life for research, posing challenges due to the sensitive nature of medical information, including genetics and health conditions. Regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S. and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe aim to strike a balance between data security, privacy, and the imperative for access. We present the Gemelli Generator - Real World Data (GEN-RWD) Sandbox, a modular multi-agent platform designed for distributed analytics in healthcare. Its primary objective is to empower external researchers to leverage hospital data while upholding privacy and ownership, obviating the need for direct data sharing. Docker compatibility adds an extra layer of flexibility, and scalability is assured through modular design, facilitating combinations of Proxy and Processor modules with various graphical interfaces. Security and reliability are reinforced through components like Identity and Access Management (IAM) agent, and a Blockchain-based notarisation module. Certification processes verify the identities of information senders and receivers. The GEN-RWD Sandbox architecture achieves a good level of usability while ensuring a blend of flexibility, scalability, and security. Featuring a user-friendly graphical interface catering to diverse technical expertise, its external accessibility enables personnel outside the hospital to use the platform. Overall, the GEN-RWD Sandbox emerges as a comprehensive solution for healthcare distributed analytics, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between accessibility, scalability, and security.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many countries have been trying to integrate electronic health data managed by each hospital to offer more efficient healthcare services. Since health data contain sensitive information of patients, there have been much research that present privacy preserving mechanisms. However, existing studies either require a patient to perform various steps to secure the data or restrict the patient to exerting control over the data. In this paper, we propose patient-controlled attribute-based encryption, which enables a patient (a data owner) to control access to the health data and reduces the operational burden for the patient, simultaneously. With our method, the patient has powerful control capability of his/her own health data in that he/she has the final say on the access with time limitation. In addition, our scheme provides emergency medical services which allow the emergency staffs to access the health data without the patient's permission only in the case of emergencies. We prove that our scheme is secure under cryptographic assumptions and analyze its efficiency from the patient's perspective.",

In order to protect the sensitive information, various attempts such as access control have been proposed to safeguard patients' privacy in this system. However, these schemes suffered from some certain security defects and had costly consumption, which were not suitable for the telecare medicine information system. In this paper, based on the elliptic curve cryptography, we propose a secure and efficient two-factor mutual authentication and key agreement scheme to reduce the computational cost. Such a scheme enables to provide the patient anonymity by employing the dynamic identity. Compared with other related protocols, the security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme overcomes some well-known attacks and has a better performance in the telecare medicine information system.",

    "abstract": "Due to the continuous advancements in wireless communication in terms of quality of communication and affordability of the technology, the application area of Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) significantly growing particularly in military and disaster management. Considering the sensitivity of the application areas, security in terms of detection of Denial of Service (DoS) and intrusion has become prime concern in research and development in the area. The security systems suggested in the past has state recognition problem where the system is not able to accurately identify the actual state of the network nodes due to the absence of clear definition of states of the nodes. In this context, this paper proposes a framework based on Finite State Machine (FSM) for denial of service and intrusion detection in MANETs. In particular, an Interruption Detection system for Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (ID-AODV) protocol is presented based on finite state machine. The packet dropping and sequence number attacks are closely investigated and detection systems for both types of attacks are designed. The major functional modules of ID-AODV includes network monitoring system, finite state machine and attack detection model. Simulations are carried out in network simulator NS-2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. A comparative evaluation of the performance is also performed with the state-of-the-art techniques: RIDAN and AODV. The performance evaluations attest the benefits of proposed framework in terms of providing better security for denial of service and intrusion detection attacks.",

    "title": "A short certificateless aggregate signature against coalition attacks.",
    "abstract": "Certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) is a crucial cryptosystem. It can not only compress multiple signatures into a short signature, but also ensure the validity of each signature participating in the aggregation by verifying the validity of an resulting aggregate signature. Therefore, a secure and efficient CLAS scheme is very useful for resource-constrained environments because it greatly reduces the overall length of the signature and the verifier's computational overhead. Cheng et al. presented an efficient CLAS scheme and proved its security in the random oracle model. However, we find that their scheme has security flaws. In this paper, we demonstrate that Cheng et al.'s CLAS scheme is vulnerable to coalition attacks from internal signers. To overcome these attacks, we present an improved CLAS scheme and prove that it is existentially unforgeable under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, our CLAS scheme can not only resist coalition attacks but also generate a very short aggregate signature. The performance analysis results show that our improved CLAS scheme is lower than the related CLAS schemes in terms of communication overhead and computation cost.",

    "title": "Blockchain and K-Means Algorithm for Edge AI Computing.",
    "abstract": "The current development of blockchain, technically speaking, still faces many key problems such as efficiency and scalability issues, and any distributed system faces the problem of how to balance consistency, availability, and fault tolerance need to be solved urgently. The advantage of blockchain is decentralization, and the most important thing in a decentralized system is how to make nodes reach a consensus quickly. This research mainly discusses the blockchain and K-means algorithm for edge AI computing. The natural pan-central distributed trustworthiness of blockchain provides new ideas for designing the framework and paradigm of edge AI computing. In edge AI computing, multiple devices running AI algorithms are scattered across the edge network. When it comes to decentralized management, blockchain is the underlying technology of the Bitcoin system. Due to its characteristics of immutability, traceability, and consensus mechanism of transaction data storage, it has recently received extensive attention. Blockchain technology is essentially a public ledger. This is done by recording data related to trust management to this ledger. To collaboratively complete artificial intelligence computing tasks or jointly make intelligent group decisions, frequent communication is required between these devices. By integrating idle computing resources in an area, a distributed edge computing platform is formed. Users obtain benefits by sharing their computing resources, and nodes in need complete computing tasks through the shared platform. In view of the identity security problems faced in the sharing process, this article introduces blockchain technology to realize the trust between users. All participants must register a secure identity in the blockchain network and conduct transactions in this security system. A K-means algorithm suitable for edge environments is proposed to identify different degradation stages of equipment operation reflected by multiple types of data. Based on the prediction of the fault state for a single type of data, the algorithm uses the historical data of multiple types of data together with the prediction data to predict the fault stage. During the research process, the average optimization energy consumption of K-means algorithm is 14.6% lower than that of GA. On the basis of designing a resource allocation scheme based on blockchain, the problem of how the participants can realize reliable resource use according to the recorded data on the chain is studied. The article implements the verification of the legality of the use of blockchain resources. In addition, a control node is introduced to master the global real-time information of the network to provide data support for the user's choice.",

They should ultimately contribute to a better understanding of environmentally induced adverse health effects and to appropriate preventive actions. To ensure the protection of the rights and dignity of study participants a complex legal and ethical framework is applied, consisting of several international directives, conventions, and guidelines, whether or not translated in domestic laws. Main characteristics of ethics and data protection in studies using biomarkers in the field of environmental health are summarized and current discussions on related questions and bottlenecks highlighted. In the current regulatory context, dominated by the protection of the individual study participant, difficulties are reported due to the different interpretation and implementation of the regulations of concern within and across borders. Advancement of consistency and compatibility is recommended and efforts are ongoing. An increasing demand for secondary use of data and samples poses additional challenges in finding a right balance between the individual rights of the study participants on the one hand and the common interest of, and potential benefit for the public or community at large on the other. Ethics committees could play a key role in assessing problems originating from the sometimes competing needs at individual and societal level. Building trust in science amongst (potential) study participants and within the community allows the inclusion of arguments from the societal perspective. This requires increased attention for respectful communication efforts. Striving for public participation in decision making processes may promote policy relevant research and the related translation of study results into action.",

In this paper, we describe a WBAN architecture based on the well-known publish-subscribe paradigm. We present two protocols for publishing data and sending commands to a sensor that guarantee confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Both protocols are based on a recently proposed ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme that is lightweight enough to be embedded into wearable sensors. We show how sensors can implement lattice-based access control (LBAC) policies using this scheme, which are highly appropriate for the eHealth domain.

    "abstract": "Using widely spread common approaches to systems security in health dedicated controlled environments, a level of awareness, confidence and acceptance of relevant standardisation is evaluated. Patients' information is sensitive, so putting appropriate organisational techniques as well as modern technology in place to secure health information is of paramount importance. Mobile devices are becoming the top priorities in advanced information security planning with healthcare environments being no exception. There are less and less application areas in healthcare without having a need for a mobile functionality which represents an even greater information security challenge. This is also true in emergency treatments, rehabilitation and homecare just to mention a few areas outside hospital controlled environments. Unfortunately quite often traditional unsecured communications principles are still in routine use for communicating sensitive health related information. The security awareness level with users, patients and care professionals is not high enough so potential threats and risks may not be addressed and the respective information security management is therefore weak. Standards like ISO/IEC 27000 ISMS family, the ISO/IEC 27799 information security guidelines in health are often not well known, but together with legislation principles such as HIPAA, they can help.",

    "abstract": "In the modern medical industry, sensors and other medical electronic equipment such as ECG, thermometers, etc. that measure vitals like blood pressure, body temperature, heartbeat, and blood cells are used to record patient data. The information gathered helps to create a patient profile, which in turn helps doctors treat patients appropriately and helps users gain insights into their health. But, the information collected is regionally specific and not worldwide. Thus, this may create problems in transparency, integrity, and much more. The medical details of patients collected are stored in a simple database which appears to be a centralized application that is prone to be modified or hacked by intruders and also suffers from fault tolerance. This paper aims to solve this problem using Blockchain and Data Possession methodologies. Blockchain helps to store multiple copies of data in a decentralized fashion. Thus, a secured model could be implemented using blockchain in which the patient's data can be securely sent to any medical professional, thus promoting transparency, security, and integrity. Provable Data Possession helps the users to verify that their information is intact and has not been tampered. It can be achieved using cryptography which encrypts the information of the patients stored. This paper will be beneficial for the medical department and the public such that it will be beneficial in terms of transparency, scalability, and security.",

    "title": "Design of Secure Protocol for Cloud-Assisted Electronic Health Record System Using Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "In the traditional electronic health record (EHR) management system, each medical service center manages their own health records, respectively, which are difficult to share on the different medical platforms. Recently, blockchain technology is one of the popular alternatives to enable medical service centers based on different platforms to share EHRs. However, it is hard to store whole EHR data in blockchain because of the size and the price of blockchain. To resolve this problem, cloud computing is considered as a promising solution. Cloud computing offers advantageous properties such as storage availability and scalability. Unfortunately, the EHR system with cloud computing can be vulnerable to various attacks because the sensitive data is sent over a public channel. We propose the secure protocol for cloud-assisted EHR system using blockchain. In the proposed scheme, blockchain technology is used to provide data integrity and access control using log transactions and the cloud server stores and manages the patient's EHRs to provide secure storage resources. We use an elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) to provide secure health data sharing with cloud computing. We demonstrate that the proposed EHR system can prevent various attacks by using informal security analysis and automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed EHR system provides secure mutual authentication using BAN logic analysis. We then compare the computation overhead, communication overhead, and security properties with existing schemes. Consequently, the proposed EHR system is suitable for the practical healthcare system considering security and efficiency.",

Blockchain technology has the potential to overcome these challenges, thus making clinical trials transparent and enhancing public trust in a fair and open process with all stakeholders because of its distinct features such as data immutability and transparency. This paper proposes a permissioned blockchain platform to ensure clinical data transparency and provides secure clinical trial-related solutions. We explore the core functionalities of blockchain applied to clinical trials and illustrate its general principle concretely. These clinical trial operations are automated using the smart contract, which ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction, and securely automates the clinical trial. A web-based user interface is also implemented to visualize the data from the blockchain and ease the interaction with the blockchain network. A proof of concept is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric in the case study of clinical management for multiple clinical trials to demonstrate the designed approach's feasibility. Lastly, the experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and usability of the proposed platform.",

    "abstract": "With electronic healthcare systems undergoing rapid change, optimizing the crucial process of recording physician prescriptions is a task with major implications for patient care. The power of blockchain technology and the precision of the Raft consensus algorithm are combined in this article to create a revolutionary solution for this problem. In addition to addressing these issues, the proposed framework, by focusing on the challenges associated with physician prescriptions, is a breakthrough in a new era of security and dependability for the healthcare sector. The Raft algorithm is a cornerstone that improves the diagnostic decision-making process, increases confidence in patients, and sets a new standard for robust healthcare systems. In the proposed consensus algorithm, a weighted sum of two influencing factors including the physician acceptability and inter-physicians' reliability is used for selecting the participating physicians. An investigation is conducted to see how well the Raft algorithm performs in overcoming prescription-related roadblocks that support a compelling argument for improved patient care. Apart from its technological benefits, the proposed approach seeks to revolutionize the healthcare system by fostering trust between patients and providers. Raft's ability to communicate presents the proposed solution as an effective way to deal with healthcare issues and ensure security.",

We sought to assess the proportion of physicians with updated anti-virus software in Jos University Teaching Hospital Nigeria and to determine perceived barriers to getting updates. We used a pre-tested semi-structured self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional survey among 118 physicians. The mean age (+/- SD) of subjects was 34 (+/- 4) years, with 94 male and 24 female physicians. Forty-two (36.5%) of 115 physicians with anti-virus software used an updated program (95% Cl: 27, 45). The top-three antivirus software were: McAfee 40 (33.9%), AVG 37 (31.4%) and Norton 17 (14.4%). Common infections were: Trojan horse 22 (29.7%), Brontok worm 8 (10.8%), and Ravmonlog.exe 5 (6.8%). Internet browsing with a firewall was an independent determinant for use of updated anti-virus software [OR 4.3, 95% CI, 1.86, 10.02; P < 0.001]. Busy schedule, 40 (33.9%) and lack of credit card 39 (33.1%) were perceived barriers to updating antivirus software. The use of regularly updated anti-virus software is sub-optimal among physicians implying vulnerability to computer viruses. Physicians should be careful with flash drives and should avoid being victims of the raging arms race between malware producers and anti-virus software developers.",

Controlled access to these records and authentication of images must be enforced to mitigate fraudulent activities and medical errors. This paper presents a zero-watermarking scheme implemented in the composite Contourlet Transform (CT)-Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) domain for unambiguous authentication of medical images. Further, a framework is proposed for accessing patient records based on the watermarking scheme. The patient identification details and a link to patient data encoded into a Quick Response (QR) code serves as the watermark. In the proposed scheme, the medical image is not subjected to degradations due to watermarking. Patient authentication and authorized access to patient data are realized on combining a Secret Share with the Master Share constructed from invariant features of the medical image. The Hu's invariant image moments are exploited in creating the Master Share. The proposed system is evaluated with Checkmark software and is found to be robust to both geometric and non geometric attacks.",

    "abstract": "Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is widely used for providing a convenient and efficient communicating platform between patients at home and physicians at medical centers or home health care (HHC) organizations. To ensure patient privacy, in 2013, Hao et al. proposed a chaotic map based authentication scheme with user anonymity for TMIS. Later, Lee showed that Hao et al.'s scheme is in no provision for providing fairness in session key establishment and gave an efficient user authentication and key agreement scheme using smart cards, in which only few hashing and Chebyshev chaotic map operations are required. In addition, Jiang et al. discussed that Hao et al.'s scheme can not resist stolen smart card attack and they further presented an improved scheme which attempts to repair the security pitfalls found in Hao et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we found that both Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes have a serious security problem in that a registered user's secret parameters may be intentionally exposed to many non-registered users and this problem causing the service misuse attack. Therefore, we propose a slight modification on Lee's scheme to prevent the shortcomings. Compared with previous schemes, our improved scheme not only inherits the advantages of Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes for TMIS but also remedies the serious security weakness of not being able to withstand service misuse attack.",

We aimed to investigate design challenges and opportunities of blockchain-based health devices, examine the impact of blockchain integration user experience, and assess its potential to improve data control and user trust. Using an iterative user-centered design approach, we developed a mid-fidelity prototype of a physical fidget device with a blockchain-based web application. Our key contributions include the design of a fidget toy using blockchain for secure health data management, an iterative development process balancing user needs with blockchain integration challenges, and insights into user perceptions of blockchain wearables for health. We conducted user studies, including a survey ( = 28), focus group ( = 6), interactive wireframe testing ( = 7), and prototype testing ( = 10). Our study revealed high user interest (70%) in blockchain-based data control and sharing features and improved perceived security of data (90% of users) with blockchain integration. However, we also identified challenges in user understanding of blockchain concepts, necessitating additional support. Our smart contract, deployed on the Polygon zkEVM testnet, efficiently manages data storage and retrieval while maintaining user privacy. This research advances the understanding of blockchain applications in health wearables, offering valuable insights for the future development of this field.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things has become the third wave of the information industry and cloud computing, big data, and Internet technologies. Among the many identification technologies used in the Internet of Things, radiofrequency identification technology is undoubtedly one of the most popular methods today. It is replacing the traditional contact IC card and becoming a new trend of smart cards. At the same time, a large amount of data is generated in the IoT environment. A lot of data involve user privacy, and users do not have good control over these data. Collecting and utilizing these data on the basis of protecting user privacy have become an important problem to be solved urgently. With the implementation of the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, major colleges and universities are developing rapidly through enrollment and expansion, which also brings inconvenience to campus security management. Although the traditional campus all-in-one card system can guarantee the security identity of people entering and leaving, it does not reasonably integrate and utilize this information, resulting in waste of information resources and, to a certain extent, the problem of user privacy leakage. To solve the above problems, a new system was developed to integrate resources to identify users. To protect the privacy data of Internet of Things users, a specific solution using blockchain technology is proposed; for the identity authentication problem of Internet of Things users, the identity authentication based on the public key address of the blockchain is used on the chain, and the group signature is used off the chain. The identity authentication method solves the contradiction between anonymity and traceability in blockchain application scenarios. The simulation results show that the system not only considers user privacy but also has extremely important practical significance for the promotion of Internet of Things and RF applications.",

    "title": "Applications of blockchain technology in long-term care: use cases, potentials, and barriers.",
    "abstract": "Digitalization in long-term care (LTC) is being discussed as a means of easing pressures on care service delivery, optimizing care coordination and planning processes, and improving service quality. With its advanced data protection and process automation features, blockchain technology could help solve data security and privacy issues, especially for the implementation of assistive technologies. Blockchain (BC) is thus a new technology being tapped in LTC. However, little is known about the fields, scope, and experiences of BC applications in this sector. This systematic review aims to provide an extensive overview of current discussions of BC technology in LTC settings. Particular attention was given to the use cases, the objectives behind applying the new technology, and barriers as well as facilitating factors for the implementation. According to the PRISMA methodology, we conducted a systematic literature review of academic articles and conference papers published between 2016 and 2023. The search through the Scopus database yielded 194 results, 29 of which were selected according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research on BC technologies has taken off in LTC since 2016. Scientific interest centers around use cases for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), care service management, and the improved integration of care ecosystems. However, most of the selected studies discuss prototypes that have neither yet been extensively evaluated nor been implemented and tested in real-world scenarios. Among the implementation barriers, technical immaturity, stakeholder cooperation, organizational change management, access to adequate IT infrastructure and end-user acceptance issues were most evident. Future research is needed to gain insights into context-specific implementation efforts, user experiences, benefits, and pitfalls of using BC technologies in LTC settings. While many expectations are tied to BC applications, potential negative effects have received little attention in the literature. Whether BC technology can serve as a mitigator between privacy and security preservation and improved information sharing in LTC settings is an important topic for further research.",

    "abstract": "The use of wireless sensor networks for wearable computing in health care is growing quickly. Numerous applications are already in use, such as blood pressure monitors and heart rate monitors. As such, it is very important for system designers to consider how to protect patient privacy, especially in wireless sensor networks. After studying and analyzing the features of wireless sensor networks in medical systems, a data division scheme was proposed in this paper, provided the advantages of homomorphic encryption. In the proposed scheme, even if a forwarding node is compromised, the attacker will not be able to eavesdrop on the data, resulting in much stronger privacy than existing schemes. Experimental results shows that the scheme provides a good trade off in resources consumed and system security, and is efficient for encrypting or decrypting sensitive medical data.",

    "abstract": "Telecare medical information systems (TMIS) enable healthcare delivery services. However, access of these services via public channel raises security and privacy issues. In recent years, several smart card based authentication schemes have been introduced to ensure secure and authorized communication between remote entities over the public channel for the (TMIS). We analyze the security of some of the recently proposed authentication schemes of Lin, Xie et al., Cao and Zhai, and Wu and Xu's for TMIS. Unfortunately, we identify that these schemes failed to satisfy desirable security attributes. In this article we briefly discuss four dynamic ID-based authentication schemes and demonstrate their failure to satisfy desirable security attributes. The study is aimed to demonstrate how inefficient password change phase can lead to denial of server scenario for an authorized user, and how an inefficient login phase causes the communication and computational overhead and decrease the performance of the system. Moreover, we show the vulnerability of Cao and Zhai's scheme to known session specific temporary information attack, vulnerability of Wu and Xu's scheme to off-line password guessing attack, and vulnerability of Xie et al.'s scheme to untraceable on-line password guessing attack.",

    "title": "Secure and lightweight network admission and transmission protocol for body sensor networks.",
    "abstract": "A body sensor network (BSN) is a wireless network of biosensors and a local processing unit, which is commonly referred to as the personal wireless hub (PWH). Personal health information (PHI) is collected by biosensors and delivered to the PWH before it is forwarded to the remote healthcare center for further processing. In a BSN, it is critical to only admit eligible biosensors and PWH into the network. Also, securing the transmission from each biosensor to PWH is essential not only for ensuring safety of PHI delivery, but also for preserving the privacy of PHI. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a secure network admission and transmission subsystem based on a polynomial-based authentication scheme. The procedures in this subsystem to establish keys for each biosensor are communication efficient and energy efficient. Moreover, based on the observation that an adversary eavesdropping in a BSN faces inevitable channel errors, we propose to exploit the adversary's uncertainty regarding the PHI transmission to update the individual key dynamically and improve key secrecy. In addition to the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties of our system, this paper also reports the experimental results of the proposed protocol on resource-limited sensor platforms, which show the efficiency of our system in practice.",

This article presents distilled core information about the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) legislation--the standards, penalties for violations, and status of final rules. It also raises several key unsolved issues of which clinicians, executives, and health care providers must be aware so they can prepare and plan for the upcoming changes. HIPAA is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system, as well as to increase the protection and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information. The costs of making the transition to the legislated standards and processes remain a worrisome factor. Although there are two years before these standards must be implemented, and cost and compliance issues resolved, work has already begun in many health institutions to identify and address them.",

There is a gap in this research addressing the problems of security vulnerabilities in this industry. The objective is to identify the level of web application security vulnerabilities in online pharmacies and the common types of flaws, thus expanding on prior studies. Technical, managerial and legal recommendations on how to mitigate security issues are presented. The proposed four-step method first consists of choosing an online testing tool. The next steps involve choosing a list of 60 online pharmacy sites to test, and then running the software analysis to compile a list of flaws. Finally, an in-depth analysis is performed on the types of web application vulnerabilities. The majority of sites had serious vulnerabilities, with the majority of flaws being cross-site scripting or old versions of software that have not been updated. A method is proposed for the securing of web pharmacy sites, using a multi-phased approach of technical and managerial techniques together with a thorough understanding of national legal requirements for securing systems.",

    "title": "A Double Chaotic Layer Encryption Algorithm for Clinical Signals in Telemedicine.",
    "abstract": "Recently, telemedicine offers medical services remotely via telecommunications systems and physiological monitoring devices. This scheme provides healthcare delivery services between physicians and patients conveniently, since some patients can not attend the hospital due to any reason. However, transmission of information over an insecure channel such as internet or private data storing generates a security problem. Therefore, authentication, confidentiality, and privacy are important challenges in telemedicine, where only authorized users should have access to medical or clinical records. On the other hand, chaotic systems have been implemented efficiently in cryptographic systems to provide confidential and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel symmetric encryption algorithm based on logistic map with double chaotic layer encryption (DCLE) in diffusion process and just one round of confusion-diffusion for the confidentiality and privacy of clinical information such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and blood pressure (BP) for applications in telemedicine. The clinical signals are acquired from PhysioBank data base for encryption proposes and analysis. In contrast with recent schemes in literature, we present a secure cryptographic algorithm based on chaos validated with the most complete security analysis until this time. In addition, the cryptograms are validated with the most complete pseudorandomness tests based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-22 suite. All results are at MATLAB simulations and all them show the effectiveness, security, robustness, and the potential use of the proposed scheme in telemedicine.",

This study addressed the need to balance privacy preserving and data usability in blockchain-based HIE systems. We propose a searchable blockchain-based HIE system that enhances privacy preserving while improving data usability. The proposed methodology includes users collecting healthcare information (HI) from various Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and compiling this information into EHR blocks for sharing on a blockchain network. This approach allows participants to search and utilize specific health data within the blockchain effectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed system mitigates the issues of traditional HIE systems by providing secure and user-friendly access to EHRs. The proposed searchable blockchain-based HIE system resolves the trade-off dilemma in HIE by achieving a balance between security and the data usability of EHRs.",

    "abstract": "Multiple users access computer workstations in busy clinical settings, requiring many logins throughout the day as users switch from one computer to another. This can lead to workflow inefficiencies as well as security concerns resulting from users sharing login sessions to save time. Proximity cards and readers have the potential to improve efficiency and security by allowing users to access clinical workstations simply by bringing the card near the reader, without the need for manual entry of a username and password. To assess the perceived impact of proximity cards and readers for rapid user authentication to clinical workstations in the setting of an existing electronic health record with single sign-on software already installed. Questionnaires were administered to clinical faculty and staff five months before and three months after the installation of proximity card readers in an inpatient birthing center and an outpatient obstetrics clinic. Open-ended feedback was also collected and qualitatively analyzed. There were 71 and 33 responses to the pre- and post-implementation surveys, respectively. There was a significant increase in the perceived speed of login with the proximity cards, and a significant decrease in the self-reported occurrence of shared login sessions between users. Feedback regarding the system was mostly positive, although several caveats were noted, including minimal benefit when used with an obstetric application that did not support single sign-on. Proximity cards and readers, along with single sign-on software, have the potential to enhance workflow efficiency by allowing for faster login times and diminish security concerns by reducing shared logins on clinical workstations. The positive feedback was used by our health system leadership to support the expanded implementation of the proximity card readers throughout the clinical setting.",

    "title": "Quantum secure patient login credential system using blockchain for electronic health record sharing framework.",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, most of the medical records are maintained in a digital format known as Electronic Health Records Sharing (EHRS) framework. Patients have individual login credentials for accessing these medical records. In the BCT, the information about the owner of the block and its dependency over other blocks is maintained in itself. Moreover, each block is linked with its nearby blocks, leading to a network controlled by patients responsible for storing and sharing the information. In healthcare, BCT can help with mobile health apps, monitoring equipment, sharing and keeping of clinical trial data, electronic medical records, and insurance information storage. This study proposes a secure Patient Login Credential System (PLCS) for EHRS. The proposed scheme has been included for block encryption with the symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithms with respect to the hospital server and patients. Additionally, the Quantum Secure Trust Protocol (QSTP) is integrated to enhance trust and security between the patient-side and hospital-side, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. Similarly, the Tune Swarm Optimization (TSO) algorithm is utilized to optimize performance metrics. The security analysis for the proposed scheme has been evaluated with basic security assumptions for information systems like, availability, access control, maintaining forward secrecy, and maintaining data integrity. The proposed scheme demonstrated enhanced security and performance, with IDEA achieving encryption in 58 ms and decryption in 278 ms for a 512-bit block, offering the best performance in terms of encryption speed.",

    "abstract": "The advent of blockchain technology within the healthcare domain has signified a paradigm shift, transitioning from an emerging trend to an essential infrastructure component that ensures decentralization, transparency, integrity, and persistent availability. Despite its potential, the healthcare sector has not fully capitalized on the vast array of benefits blockchain technology offers. Most existing works utilized blockchain technology within a specific healthcare entity's services but not among several healthcare organizations. They notably lack the provision for direct communication and knowledge transfer between doctors from different hospitals. Therefore, this paper introduces a pioneering Blockchain-based Unified Medical Consultancy Service (B-UMCS) that leverages blockchain's robustness to revolutionize telehealth services by (a) alleviating the shortage of medical expertise through facilitating the interconnection of physicians from diverse hospitals and geographical areas onto a consolidated platform, (b) promoting the seamless sharing of medical consultations, electronic health records (EHRs), and expert insights while upholding rigorous security and privacy protocols, (c) integrating the inherent security mechanisms of blockchain with the distributed data storage functionality offered by the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). This work details the B-UMCS's components, interactions, smart contracts, protocols, algorithms, storage and transmission of EHRs, and their corresponding implementations. The evaluations of the proposed B-UMCS reveal that it secures and facilitates the sharing of EHRs and enables healthcare professionals to collaborate and exchange expertise seamlessly across institutional boundaries. They are additionally ensuring that healthcare providers can offer their knowledge in an efficient and scalable manner. Overall, B-UMCS not only addresses the current challenges in healthcare data security and accessibility but also opens new avenues for collaboration and knowledge sharing among healthcare professionals, ultimately contributing to improving patient care quality.",

    "title": "Synthetic Health Data: Real Ethical Promise and Peril.",
    "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners are increasingly using machine-generated synthetic data as a tool for advancing health science and practice, by expanding access to health data while-potentially-mitigating privacy and related ethical concerns around data sharing. While using synthetic data in this way holds promise, we argue that it also raises significant ethical, legal, and policy concerns, including persistent privacy and security problems, accuracy and reliability issues, worries about fairness and bias, and new regulatory challenges. The virtue of synthetic data is often understood to be its detachment from the data subjects whose measurement data is used to generate it. However, we argue that addressing the ethical issues synthetic data raises might require bringing data subjects back into the picture, finding ways that researchers and data subjects can be more meaningfully engaged in the construction and evaluation of datasets and in the creation of institutional safeguards that promote responsible use.",

    "title": "Increase in Drug Spending in Canada Due to Extension of Data Protection for Biologics: A Descriptive Study.",
    "abstract": "Biologics are currently protected from competition by eight years of data protection. The renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) increases data protection from 8 to 10 years. This study investigates the effect of such an extension on drug spending in Canada. A list of currently available biologics eligible for data protection along with their 2017 sales was compiled. Two years were added to the current expiration date of data protection to see if it exceeded patent protection, and any theoretical change in spending due to delayed competition was calculated. The number of biologics approved after January 1, 1995, that have competition and the time until competition started was analyzed. Theoretical competition due to increased data protection for biologics where data protection has already expired was examined. Depending on how much of the market is captured by biologic competitors and how strong the patents are, lost savings from data protection extension could range from $0 to $305.8 million. One biologic competitor currently on the market could theoretically have been affected by an increase in data protection. Increased data protection would have had minor effects on products that have already lost data protection. The potential impact on drug expenditures of a two-year extension in data protection is highly variable. Possible increases in spending on biologics strengthen the rationale for a national pharmacare plan where monopsony buying power would help to control drug prices overall and offset increased spending on biologics.",

    "title": "Privacy and security issues in a wide area health communications network.",
    "abstract": "In 1993 the first national health information service went live in New Zealand, using commercial network services for all communications. This system provides a point of connection for all health personnel, and for those with a legitimate interest in health care information (e.g. insurers): it also provides access to a number of information resources managed on behalf of the government of New Zealand (e.g. index of health care users), as well as to those developed by individual network service providers. Much of the data exchanged across this network is personalised. Since the recipient may not be known personally to the sender, it is vital that the sender has confidence that the recipient will treat personal information according to agreed criteria for privacy. A Code of Practice covering health information was developed under the New Zealand Privacy Act to ensure that the confidence to share confidential data was supported. For large organisations such as hospitals to function efficiently, they need the flexibility to be able quickly to assign user privileges to selected staff without the need for extra paperwork seeking approval from the centre. But the audit trail requires unique identification of the individual undertaking each transaction. This requirement has been addressed. Some of the data moved across the network relates to life-critical issues, e.g. clinical warnings about allergies or serious medical conditions. A failure of communications causing this vital information to be improperly represented in some way on the receivers system could have disastrous consequences. To ensure the integrity of data transfers, user installations have to be certified compliant with standard test scripts before they are authorized for access to these resources.",

    "abstract": "A smart-card-based user authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks (hereafter referred to as a SCA-WSN scheme) is designed to ensure that only users who possess both a smart card and the corresponding password are allowed to gain access to sensor data and their transmissions. Despite many research efforts in recent years, it remains a challenging task to design an efficient SCA-WSN scheme that achieves user anonymity. The majority of published SCA-WSN schemes use only lightweight cryptographic techniques (rather than public-key cryptographic techniques) for the sake of efficiency, and have been demonstrated to suffer from the inability to provide user anonymity. Some schemes employ elliptic curve cryptography for better security but require sensors with strict resource constraints to perform computationally expensive scalar-point multiplications; despite the increased computational requirements, these schemes do not provide user anonymity. In this paper, we present a new SCA-WSN scheme that not only achieves user anonymity but also is efficient in terms of the computation loads for sensors. Our scheme employs elliptic curve cryptography but restricts its use only to anonymous user-to-gateway authentication, thereby allowing sensors to perform only lightweight cryptographic operations. Our scheme also enjoys provable security in a formal model extended from the widely accepted Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (2000) model to capture the user anonymity property and various SCA-WSN specific attacks (e.g., stolen smart card attacks, node capture attacks, privileged insider attacks, and stolen verifier attacks).",

This paper makes a short survey on PDC research by summarizing related papers published in recent years. The concept, classification, and significance of personal data are elaborately introduced and then the semantics correlation and semantics representation of personal data are discussed. A multilayer reference architecture of PDC, including its core components and a real-world operational scenario showing how the reference architecture works, is introduced in detail. Existing commercial PDC products/prototypes are listed and compared from several perspectives. Five open issues to improve the shortcomings of current PDC research are put forward.",

Biological factors are incorporated into matching and the cross-matching process is implemented into the smart contracts. Privacy is guaranteed by using patient-associated blockchain addresses, without transmitting or using patient personal records in the matching process. The matching algorithm implemented as a smart contract is verifiable by any party. Clinical records, process updates, and matching results are also stored on the blockchain, providing tamper-resistance of recipient's records and the recipients' waiting queue. The system also is capable of handling cases in which there is a donor without an immediate compatible recipient. The system is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain and several scenarios were tested. The performance of the proposed system is compared to other existing organ donation systems, and ours outperformed any existing organ matching system built on blockchain. BOMS is tested to ascertain its compatibility with public, private, and consortium blockchain networks, checks for security vulnerabilities and cross-matching efficiency. The implementation codes are available online.",

One downside of this is that firms can experience negative publicity and financial damage if their data are breached. This is particularly the case in the medical sector, where we find empirical evidence that increased digitization of patient data is associated with more data breaches. The encryption of customer data is often presented as a potential solution, because encryption acts as a disincentive for potential malicious hackers, and can minimize the risk of breached data being put to malicious use. However, encryption both requires careful data management policies to be successful and does not ward off the insider threat. Indeed, we find no empirical evidence of a decrease in publicized instances of data loss associated with the use of encryption. Instead, there are actually increases in the cases of publicized data loss due to internal fraud or loss of computer equipment.",

    "title": "Maybe If We Turn It Off and Then Turn It Back On Again? Exploring Health Care Reform as a Means to Curb Cyber Attacks.",
    "abstract": "The health care industry has moved at a rapid pace away from paper records to an electronic platform across almost all sectors - much of it at the encouragement and insistence of the federal government. Such rapid expansion has increased exponentially the risk to individuals in the privacy of their data and, increasingly, to their physical well-being when medical records are inaccessible through ransomware attacks. Recognizing the unique and critical nature of medical records, the United States Congress established the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force under the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 for the purpose of reviewing cybersecurity risks within the health care industry and identifying who will lead and coordinate efforts to address such risks among the various agencies. The Task Force has since issued a report setting forth six high-level imperatives that the health care industry needs to achieve in order to combat cybersecurity, and, notably, many of the vulnerabilities plaguing the industry identified in the Report as requiring correction are not necessarily related to specific flaws in the current cybersecurity framework, but rather susceptibilities presented by the infrastructure and associated regulatory regime that has evolved over the last few decades over the health care industry generally. That is, the current health care infrastructure by its nature exacerbates cybersecurity risk. Between a lack of information sharing of industry threats, risks, and mitigations, disparate leadership and governance goals for cybersecurity, the confluence and contradiction of existing federal and state laws, fragmentation in the fee-for-service delivery system, lack of care coordination, and disparate resources across and among sectors, the industry suffers from heightened cyber risk. Solutions that are reactive to problems within the current infrastructure will likely have little long term impact toward reducing cybersecurity vulnerabilities because they do not address the underlying system challenges. All of these confluences causes one to wonder whether if in fact the current health care delivery infrastructure is a contributing factor to the incidents of cybersecurity attacks and the exorbitant costs associated with resolving data breaches, should Congress look not just to curb breach incidents, but to address root cause systematic challenges in the health industry infrastructure that create increased exposure of cybersecurity threats? This article argues that cybersecurity risks will continue to be heightened and more costly to the health care industry as compared to other industries unless and until some general system redesign is achieved that allows for (1) greater sharing of resources among industry participants to ensure the same protections are implemented at all levels of the industry, which can be strengthened through greater interoperability of systems across the health care industry; and (2) increased focus and attention on the importance of cybersecurity issues as a priority among system reforms.",

In order to protect and preserve the MANET and location based services, there are various existing location based anonymity protocols such as k-anonymity location based, but these protocols are more overhead due to the dynamic mobility nature of ad-hoc networks. In this paper we proposed an Adaptive Risk Prediction and Anonymous Secured Communication protocol to predict the risk before processing anonymous communication. The proposed protocol estimates the risk against adjacent nodes and estimates the vulnerability paths using hidden markov model and decision tree. The decision tree determines the evidence to identify the trusted paths. The anonymous communication message authentication scheme assigns the anonymous communication and organize the secured authentication scheme. We simulated the network by considering different attacks to determine the efficiency of Adaptive Risk Prediction and Anonymous Secured Communication using NS2 simulator.",

We employed smart contracts in the blockchain system to achieve user rights management. We used the decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable features of the blockchain to realize the safe sharing of electronic medical records. The experimental results of security analysis show that the method can defend against potential network attacks while satisfying patient privacy protection and confidentiality. This study verifies the feasibility and great operating efficiency of the blockchain-based electronic medical record security sharing scheme.Clinical relevance- Our proposed blockchain-based electronic medical record-sharing scheme has great potential for the safe access of third-party users to patient data.",

    "title": "Opportunistic access control scheme for enhancing IoT-enabled healthcare security using blockchain and machine learning.",
    "abstract": "The healthcare industry, aided by technology, leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to offer patient/user-related services that are ubiquitous and personalized. The authorized repository stores ubiquitous data for which access-level securities are granted. These security measures ensure that only authorized entities can access patient/user health information, preventing unauthorized entries and data downloads. However, recent sophisticated security and privacy attacks such as data breaches, data integrity issues, and data collusion have raised concerns in the healthcare industry. As healthcare data grows, conventional solutions often fail due to scalability concerns, causing inefficiencies and delays. This is especially true for multi-key authentication. Dependence on conventional access control systems leads to security flaws and authorization errors caused by static user behaviour models. This article introduces an Opportunistic Access Control Scheme (OACS) for leveraging access-level security. This approach is a defendable access control scheme in which the user permissions are based on their requirement and data. After accessing the healthcare record, a centralized IoT security augmentation and assessment is provided. The blockchain records determine and revoke the access grant based on previous access and delegation sequences. This scheme analyses the possible delegation methods for providing precise users with interrupt-free healthcare record access. The blockchain recommendations are analyzed using a trained learning paradigm to provide further access and denials. The proposed method reduces false rates by 11.74%, increases access rates by 13.1%, speeds up access and processing by 12.36% and 13.23%, respectively, and reduces failure rates by 9.94%. The OACS decreases false rates by 10.64%, processing time by 15.62%, and failure rates by 10.95%.",

The negotiations of the EU data protection legislation ran from 2012 until 2015 and resulted in a unified data protection legislation directly binding for all European member states. I employ a discourse analysis to examine EU policy documents and Austrian media materials related to the reform process. Using the concept 'sociotechnical imaginary', I show how a European imaginary of search engines is forming in the EU policy domain, how a European identity is constructed in the envisioned politics of control, and how national specificities contribute to the making and unmaking of a European identity. I discuss the roles that national technopolitical identities play in shaping both search technology and Europe, taking as an example Austria, a small country with a long history in data protection and a tradition of restrained technology politics.",

    "title": "Leveraging blockchain and IoMT for secure and interoperable electronic health records.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is transforming healthcare by seamlessly connecting medical devices, wearables, and sensors to enable personalized, real-time health monitoring and treatment for consumers. As IoMT continues to advance, ensuring the security and privacy of transmitted data has become a critical concern. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance privacy and security, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical data within the Internet of Things. By integrating blockchain with IoT, secure transmission of medical data can be achieved, paving the way for improved healthcare services, enhanced consumer privacy, and accelerated medical advancements. In this paper, we propose EHRGuard: Enhancing Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Records through Blockchain Technology. EHRGuard is a novel system that leverages blockchain technology to address key challenges in the management of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), with a focus on improving privacy, security, and interoperability in healthcare data systems for consumers. The framework utilizes the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect real-time health data from consumers through sensors and integrates blockchain technology to ensure data anonymity, security, and integrity. By combining IoMT and blockchain, EHRGuard enables the seamless and secure gathering of real-time health data, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and tampering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional healthcare systems in terms of service quality and consumer data monitoring. This innovative approach not only enhances the security and privacy of EHRs but also fosters trust and efficiency in healthcare systems, ultimately benefiting consumers and advancing medical research and treatment.",

    "title": "Canada: will privacy rules continue to favour open science?",
    "abstract": "Canada's regulatory frameworks governing privacy and research are generally permissive of genomic data sharing, though they may soon be tightened in response to public concerns over commercial data handling practices and the strengthening of influential European privacy laws. Regulation can seem complex and uncertain, in part because of the constitutional division of power between federal and provincial governments over both privacy and health care. Broad consent is commonly practiced in genomic research, but without explicit regulatory recognition, it is often scrutinized by research or privacy oversight bodies. Secondary use of health-care data is legally permissible under limited circumstances. A new federal law prohibits genetic discrimination, but is subject to a constitutional challenge. Privacy laws require security safeguards proportionate to the data sensitivity, including breach notification. Special categories of data are not defined a priori. With some exceptions, Canadian researchers are permitted to share personal information internationally but are held accountable for safeguarding the privacy and security of these data. Cloud computing to store and share large scale data sets is permitted, if shared responsibilities for access, responsible use, and security are carefully articulated. For the moment, Canada's commercial sector is recognized as \"adequate\" by Europe, facilitating import of European data. Maintaining adequacy status under the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a concern because of Canada's weaker individual rights, privacy protections, and regulatory enforcement. Researchers must stay attuned to shifting international and national regulations to ensure a sustainable future for responsible genomic data sharing.",

    "title": "Meeting the security requirements of electronic medical records in the ERA of high-speed computing.",
    "abstract": "This study has two objectives. First, it aims to develop a system with a highly secured approach to transmitting electronic medical records (EMRs), and second, it aims to identify entities that transmit private patient information without permission. The NTRU and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptosystems are secured encryption methods. The AES is a tested technology that has already been utilized in several systems to secure sensitive data. The United States government has been using AES since June 2003 to protect sensitive and essential information. Meanwhile, NTRU protects sensitive data against attacks through the use of quantum computers, which can break the RSA cryptosystem and elliptic curve cryptography algorithms. A hybrid of AES and NTRU is developed in this work to improve EMR security. The proposed hybrid cryptography technique is implemented to secure the data transmission process of EMRs. The proposed security solution can provide protection for over 40 years and is resistant to quantum computers. Moreover, the technique provides the necessary evidence required by law to identify disclosure or misuse of patient records. The proposed solution can effectively secure EMR transmission and protect patient rights. It also identifies the source responsible for disclosing confidential patient records. The proposed hybrid technique for securing data managed by institutional websites must be improved in the future.",

However, health data are highly sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which aims to ensure patient's privacy. Anonymization or removal of patient identifiable information, although the most conventional way, is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and incorporate privacy concerns. In this article, we review the existing anonymization techniques and their applicability to various types (relational and graph based) of health data. Besides, we provide an overview of possible attacks on anonymized data. We illustrate via a that anonymization, although necessary, is not sufficient to address patient privacy and discuss methods for protecting against such attacks. Finally, we discuss tools that can be used to achieve anonymization.",

    "abstract": "The Australian healthcare sector is a complex mix of government departments, associations, providers, professionals, and consumers. Cybersecurity attacks, which have recently increased, challenge the sector in many ways; however, the best approaches for the sector to manage the threat are unclear. This study will report on a semi-structured focus group conducted with five representatives from the Australian healthcare and computer security sectors. An analysis of this focus group transcript yielded four themes: 1) the challenge of securing the Australian healthcare landscape; 2) the financial challenges of cybersecurity in healthcare; 3) balancing privacy and transparency; 4) education and regulation. The results indicate the need for sector-specific tools to empower the healthcare sector to mitigate cybersecurity threats, most notably using a self-evaluation tool so stakeholders can proactively prepare for incidents. Despite the vast amount of research into cybersecurity, little has been conducted on proactive cybersecurity approaches where security weaknesses are identified weaknesses before they occur.",

We used the brute force analysis and dictionary attack analysis of the PsychoPass method to outline its weaknesses. The first issue with the Psychopass method is that it requires the password reproduction on the same keyboard layout as was used to generate the password. The second issue is a security weakness: although the produced password is 24 characters long, the password is still weak. We elaborate on the weakness and propose a solution that produces strong passwords. The proposed version first requires the use of the SHIFT and ALT-GR keys in combination with other keys, and second, the keys need to be 1-2 distances apart. The proposed improved PsychoPass method yields passwords that can be broken only in hundreds of years based on current computing powers. The proposed PsychoPass method requires 10 keys, as opposed to 20 keys in the original method, for comparable password strength.",

I address, (i) how information can be stored and encoded in biological mediums, (ii) how biological mediums (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein) and storage systems (e.g. cells, biofilms, organisms) influence the nature of information security, and (iii) what constitutes a viable application of such biotechnologies.",

    "title": "Research on trust mechanism of supply chain finance under Industrial Internet embedded with blockchain.",
    "abstract": "In traditional supply chain finance, the financing of enterprise mainly relies on the credit segmentation of the core enterprise, resulting in a short trust transmission radius and poor financing ability. The development of Internet technology, while expanding financing channels, has also seen an increasing severity in issues such as information fraud and data breaches, which has further aggravated the trust crisis in supply chain finance. This paper integrates blockchain technology into the industrial internet platform and analyzes the applicability of both in empowering supply chain financial trust. Then a supply chain financial trust framework, which emphasizes information sharing, data security, and trust circulation, is proposed. Furthermore, combined with the theories of Funk-SVD and entropy value, this paper designs a global trust evaluation mechanism that facilitates the trust circulation in supply chain finance and proposes a recommendation algorithm for global trust. With the testing conducted using the Epinions dataset, it is found that the algorithm proposed in this paper has a strong data dimensionality reduction and concentration ability, especially for large sample data, it can obtain more accurate evaluation values with less space occupation, thus enhancing the trust circulation ability of supply chain finance. Finally, the paper puts forward specific policy recommendations for the implementation of the supply chain finance information mechanism, aiming to better improve the financing accessibility of enterprises in supply chain, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.",

    "title": "PKI-based secure mobile access to electronic health services and data.",
    "abstract": "Recent research works examine the potential employment of public-key cryptography schemes in e-health environments. In such systems, where a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is established beforehand, Attribute Certificates (ACs) and public key enabled protocols like TLS, can provide the appropriate mechanisms to effectively support authentication, authorization and confidentiality services. In other words, mutual trust and secure communications between all the stakeholders, namely physicians, patients and e-health service providers, can be successfully established and maintained. Furthermore, as the recently introduced mobile devices with access to computer-based patient record systems are expanding, the need of physicians and nurses to interact increasingly with such systems arises. Considering public key infrastructure requirements for mobile online health networks, this paper discusses the potential use of Attribute Certificates (ACs) in an anticipated trust model. Typical trust interactions among doctors, patients and e-health providers are presented, indicating that resourceful security mechanisms and trust control can be obtained and implemented. The application of attribute certificates to support medical mobile service provision along with the utilization of the de-facto TLS protocol to offer competent confidentiality and authorization services is also presented and evaluated through experimentation, using both the 802.11 WLAN and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) networks.",

    "title": "Towards the Use of Blockchain in Mobile Health Services and Applications.",
    "abstract": "With the advent of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the growth and adaptation of cryptographic features and capabilities were quickly extended to new and underexplored areas, such as healthcare. Currently, blockchain is being implemented mainly as a mechanism to secure Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, new studies have shown that this technology can be a powerful tool in empowering patients to control their own health data, as well for enabling a fool-proof health data history and establishing medical responsibility. Additionally, with the proliferation of mobile health (m-Health) sustained on service-oriented architectures, the adaptation of blockchain mechanisms into m-Health applications creates the possibility for a more decentralized and available healthcare service. Hence, this paper presents a review of the current security best practices for m-Health and the most used and widely known implementations of the blockchain protocol, including blockchain technologies in m-Health. The main goal of this comprehensive review is to further discuss and elaborate on identified open-issues and potential use cases regarding the uses of blockchain in this area. Finally, the paper presents the major findings, challenges and advantages on future blockchain implementations for m-Health services and applications.",

    "title": "Potential impact of HITECH security regulations on medical imaging.",
    "abstract": "Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 [1] include a provision commonly referred to as the \"Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act\" or \"HITECH Act\" that is intended to promote the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care. Subtitle D of the HITECH Act includes key amendments to strengthen the privacy and security regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HITECH act also states that \"the National Coordinator\" must consult with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in determining what standards are to be applied and enforced for compliance with HIPAA. This has led to speculation that NIST will recommend that the government impose the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) [2], which was created by NIST for application within the federal government, as requirements to the public Electronic Health Records (EHR) community in the USA. In this paper we will describe potential impacts of FISMA on medical image sharing strategies such as teleradiology and outline how a strict application of FISMA or FISMA-based regulations could have significant negative impacts on information sharing between care providers.",

    "title": "Barriers to and Facilitators of the Use of Mobile Health Apps From a Security Perspective: Mixed-Methods Study.",
    "abstract": "A large number of mobile health (mHealth) apps have been created to help users to manage their health or receive health care services. Many of these mHealth apps have proven to be helpful for maintaining or improving their users' health. However, many people still choose not to use mHealth apps or only use them for a short period. One of the reasons behind this lack of use is the concern for their health information security and privacy. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between users' characteristics and their security and privacy concerns and to identify desired security features in mHealth apps, which could reduce these concerns. A questionnaire was designed and validated by the research team. This questionnaire was then used to determine mobile app users' security and privacy concerns regarding personal health data in mHealth apps as well as the security features most users' desire. A semistructured interview was used to identify barriers to and facilitators of adopting mHealth apps. In total, 117 randomly selected study participants from a large pool took part in this study and provided responses to the validated questionnaire and the semistructured interview questions. The results indicate that most study participants did have concerns about their privacy when using mHealth apps. They also expressed their preferences regarding several security features in mHealth apps, such as regular password updates, remote wipe, user consent, and access control. An association between their demographic characteristics and their concerns and preferences in security and privacy was identified; however, in most cases, the differences among the different demographic groups were not statistically significant, except for a few very specific aspects. These study participants also indicated that the cost of apps and lack of security features in mHealth apps were barriers for adoption, whereas having free apps, strong but easy-to-use security features, and clear user protection privacy policies might encourage them to use mHealth apps in their health management. This questionnaire and interview study verified the security and privacy concerns of mHealth app users, identified the desired security and privacy features, and determined specific barriers to and facilitators of users adopting mHealth apps. The results can be used to guide mHealth app developers to create apps that would be welcomed by users.",

While exhibiting fundamental principles, this work was done in conjunction with the vision that DNA-based circuitry, when the technology matures, will form the basis for a tamper-proof security module, revolutionizing the meaning and concept of tamper-proofing and possibly preventing it altogether based on accurate scientific observations. A paramount part of such a solution would be self-generation of random numbers. A novel prototype schema employs solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides for random construction of DNA sequences; temporary storage and retrieval is achieved through plasmid vectors. A discussion of how to evaluate sequence randomness is included, as well as how these techniques are applied to a simulation of the random number generation circuitry. Simulation results show generated sequences successfully pass three selected NIST random number generation tests specified for security applications.",

    "abstract": "The realization of the German law for a new structure of health care delivery by the assurance of efficient structures and processes in hospitals calls for an optimal design of informational processes. To realize applications near to the users and just in time as well as to build up the complex functional relationships between departments and subsystems in big hospitals, a new design for Hospital Information Systems (HIS) is necessary. The features of modern HIS outlined in the paper can only be established by open systems, which guarantee portability, scalability and interoperability. This is also true in regionally distributed systems like the tumour register at Cancer Centres. In the paper the necessity and possibilities of open systems and different levels of application integration are discussed. The general statements are illustrated by practical realizations in the HIS of the Magdeburg University Hospital as well as in the tumour register at the Cancer Centre of Magdeburg/Sachsen-Anhalt. The creation of integrated structures for communications makes great demands on the assurance of data security and data protection, especially for the inclusion of external partners from the region. In the context of high sensitive data of cancer patients data protection is of top priority. The legal problems of data collection, data storage and exchange in medicine are discussed first. The paper presents some aspects of the concept for data security and data protection in the Magdeburg University HIS and of the related concept for data protection in the tumour register of the Cancer Centre Magdeburg/Sachsen-Anhalt. Appropriate steps of realization are demonstrated. The application of hardware based modern access control systems with integrated encryption of data follows. The statements are extended to the planned installation of hardware based network access control systems with integrated encryption of data in the LAN.",

The Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is the mechanism of the Internet of Things (IoT) found in different healthcare applications, with devices that are attached to external fog cloud networks. Using different mobile applications connecting to cloud computing, the applications of the IoHT are remote healthcare monitoring systems, high blood pressure monitoring, online medical counseling, and others. These applications are designed based on a client-server architecture based on various standards such as the common object request broker (CORBA), a service-oriented architecture (SOA), remote method invocation (RMI), and others. However, these applications do not directly support the many healthcare nodes and blockchain technology in the current standard. Thus, this study devises a potent blockchain-enabled socket RPC IoHT framework for medical enterprises (e.g., healthcare applications). The goal is to minimize service costs, blockchain security costs, and data storage costs in distributed mobile cloud networks. Simulation results show that the proposed blockchain-enabled socket RPC minimized the service cost by 40%, the blockchain cost by 49%, and the storage cost by 23% for healthcare applications.",

In this paper, we present a blockchain-based federated learning method for smart healthcare in which the edge nodes maintain the blockchain to resist a single point of failure and MIoT devices implement the federated learning to make full of the distributed clinical data. In particular, we design an adaptive differential privacy algorithm to protect data privacy and gradient verification-based consensus protocol to detect poisoning attacks. We compare our method with two similar methods on a real-world diabetes dataset. Promising experimental results show that our method can achieve high model accuracy in acceptable running time while also showing good performance in reducing the privacy budget consumption and resisting poisoning attacks.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology for shaping the next era of a healthcare system striving for efficient and effective patient care. This is thanks to its peer-to-peer, secure, and transparent characteristics. On the other hand, cloud computing made its way into the healthcare system thanks to its elasticity and cost-efficiency nature. However, cloud-based systems fail to provide a secured and private patient-centric cohesive view to multiple healthcare stakeholders. In this situation, blockchain provides solutions to address security and privacy concerns of the cloud because of its decentralization feature combined with data security and privacy, while cloud provides solutions to the blockchain scalability and efficiency challenges. Therefore a novel paradigm of blockchain-cloud integration (BcC) emerges for the domain of healthcare. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the BcC integration for the healthcare system to give the readers the motivations behind the emergence of this new paradigm, introduce a classification of existing architectures and their applications for better healthcare. We then review the development platforms and services and highlight the research challenges for the integrated BcC architecture, possible solutions, and future research directions. The results of this paper will be useful for the healthcare industry to design and develop a data management system for better patient care.",

    "abstract": "Although many organizations have adopted blockchain technology (BCT) for efficiency and automation and users' adoption of BCT is becoming crucial for the companies, few studies have focused on the factors affecting the adoption of BCT in real estate sector. This study aims to assess the factors affecting the adoption of BCT in real estate by the lens of an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Task-technology fit (TTF). This current study uses quantitative survey approach. Data were collected from 311 real sector buyers and sellers in China. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. The study's findings indicate that attitude, perceived usefulness (PU) and data privacy and security (DPS) exerts highest influence in the proposed theoretical model. In addition, the findings also confirmed the significant impact of perceived ease of use (PEOU) on attitude, and TTF impact on PU and PEOU in adoption of BCT. Furthermore, the moderating impact of perceived compatibility (PC) on the relationship between TTF and PEOU was also confirmed. The study has useful practical implications for the real estate buyers and sellers that adoption of BCT improves efficiency, reduce transaction cost incur due to intermediaries, and enhance security system. Furthermore, the study suggests that automation achieved through BCT will facilitate customized agreements and improve process of title transfer.",

    "abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical steganography method in which a data signal is transmitted using amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise as a carrier. The ASE serving as a carrier for the private signal has an identical frequency spectrum to the existing noise generated by the Erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) in the transmission system. The system also carries a conventional data channel that is not private. The so-called \"stealth\" or private channel is well-hidden within the noise of the system. Phase modulation is used for both the stealth channel and the public channel. Using homodyne detection, the short coherence length of the ASE ensures that the stealth signal can only be recovered if the receiver closely matches the delay-length difference, which is deliberately changed in a dynamic fashion that is only known to the transmitter and its intended receiver.",

    "title": "Patient Data Hiding and Transmitting during COVID-19 for Telemedicine Application using Image Steganography.",
    "abstract": "After the COVID-19 pandemic, every individual needs to be more aware of their health. The condition of the human body is ged based on various health reports like X-rays, CT scan, and MRI scans. Moreover, due to misplacement or loss of medical reports, there is a high probabaility of improper diagnosis. In order to avoid improper diagnosis, a novel data-hiding technique is proposed in this work. In the proposed method, the patient's health records are hidden using polynomial theory in the patient photograph. This is used by doctors in telemedicine for better treatment at the right time. Image steganography is useful for hiding secret images and also for generating secret keys. This enables only the authorized people (patient and corresponding doctor) to access the reports using secret keys. Four secret images (medical reports of the patient) are successfully embedded onto a single cover image (patient photo) with good quality. After embedding, the stego images look like cover images so that unauthorized persons will not be able to access the data, and hence, safe transmission is being carried out. A patient's medical report plays an important role in proper medical treatment. Particularly in telemedicine, the safe transmission of patient reports without any loss or damage is necessary. The proposed method embeds reports of a patient in his/her photo and transmitsthem to the destination safely with a quality of 45.5 dB. This hiding method is helpful to avoid cyber crimes, illegal transactions, malpractices etc.",

    "abstract": "Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data.",

    "title": "IoMT-Based Smart Healthcare Detection System Driven by Quantum Blockchain and Quantum Neural Network.",
    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main criterion for arrhythmia detection. As a means of identification, ECG leakage seems to be a common occurrence due to the development of the Internet of Medical Things. The advent of the quantum era makes it difficult for classical blockchain technology to provide security for ECG data storage. Therefore, from the perspective of safety and practicality, this article proposes a quantum arrhythmia detection system called QADS, which achieves secure storage and sharing of ECG data based on quantum blockchain technology. Furthermore, a quantum neural network is used in QADS to recognize abnormal ECG data, which contributes to further cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Each quantum block stores the hash of the current and previous block to construct a quantum block network. The new quantum blockchain algorithm introduces a controlled quantum walk hash function and a quantum authentication protocol to guarantee legitimacy and security while creating new blocks. In addition, this article constructs a hybrid quantum convolutional neural network called HQCNN to extract the temporal features of ECG to detect abnormal heartbeats. The simulation experimental results show that HQCNN achieves an average training and testing accuracy of 94.7% and 93.6%. And the detection stability is much higher than classical CNN with the same structure. HQCNN also has certain robustness under the perturbation of quantum noise. Besides, this article demonstrates through mathematical analysis that the proposed quantum blockchain algorithm has strong security and can effectively resist various quantum attacks, such as external attacks, Entanglement-Measure attack and Interception-Measurement-Repeat attack.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology includes numerous elements such as distributed ledgers, decentralization, authenticity, privacy, and immutability. It has progressed past the hype to find actual use cases in industries like healthcare. Blockchain is an emerging area that relies on a consensus algorithm and the idea of a digitally distributed ledger to eliminate any intermediary risks. By enabling them to trace data provenance and any changes made, blockchain technology can enable different healthcare stakeholders to share access to their networks without violating data security and integrity. The healthcare industry faces challenges like fragmented data, security and privacy concerns, and interoperability issues. Blockchain technology offers potential solutions by ensuring secure, tamper-proof storage across multiple network nodes, improving interoperability and patient privacy. Encrypting patient data further enhances security and reduces unauthorized access concerns. Blockchain technology, deployed over the Internet, can potentially use the current healthcare data by using a patient-centric approach and removing the intermediaries. This paper discusses the effective utilization of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. In contrast to other applications, the exoteric evaluation in this paper shows that the innovative technology called blockchain technology has a major role to play in the existing and future applications of the healthcare industry and has significant benefits.",

Service through the applications can save the patients' time and expense, such as telecare medical information system (TMIS) and integrated electronic patient record (EPR) information system. In the applications, preserving patients' privacy, transmitting messages securely and keeping mutual authentication should all be paid attention. Many authentication schemes have been proposed to make a secure communicating environment. Recently Xie et al. showed that Wen's scheme was insecure because it was under the off-line password guessing attack and without user anonymity and forward security. They gave a new three-factor authentication scheme and claimed that it was secure. However, we find that Xie et al's scheme is vulnerable to the De-synchronization attack and the server has too much storage burden in the scheme. Then we present an improved scheme which overcomes the usual weaknesses and keeps ordinary security characters. Compared with recent schemes of the same kind, our scheme is secure and practical.",

    "abstract": "In the existing centralized location services system structure, the server is easily attracted and be the communication bottleneck. It caused the disclosure of users' location. For this, we presented a new distributed collaborative recommendation strategy that is based on the distributed system. In this strategy, each node establishes profiles of their own location information. When requests for location services appear, the user can obtain the corresponding location services according to the recommendation of the neighboring users' location information profiles. If no suitable recommended location service results are obtained, then the user can send a service request to the server according to the construction of a k-anonymous data set with a centroid position of the neighbors. In this strategy, we designed a new model of distributed collaborative recommendation location service based on the users' location information profiles and used generalization and encryption to ensure the safety of the user's location information privacy. Finally, we used the real location data set to make theoretical and experimental analysis. And the results show that the strategy proposed in this paper is capable of reducing the frequency of access to the location server, providing better location services and protecting better the user's location privacy.",

Such applications require ubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services quickly. Toward this aim, sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers superior performance with high reliability, enhanced transmission rate, and low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applications is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various network-related attacks (i.e., data injection or modification) to jeopardize the regular operation of the smart applications. Therefore, incorporating blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent solution to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated by the same, we presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes the essential characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime data. The case study is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different research challenges of adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.",

Due to this phenomenon, how to provide the elderly and patients with chronic diseases a suitable healthcare environment has become a critical issue presently. Therefore, we propose a new scheme that integrates healthcare services with wireless sensor technology in which sensor nodes are employed to measure patients' vital signs. Data collected from these sensor nodes are then transmitted to mobile devices of the medical staff and system administrator, promptly enabling them to understand the patients' condition in real time, which will significantly improve patients' healthcare quality. As per the personal data protection act, patients' vital signs can only be accessed by authorized medical staff. In order to protect patients', the system administrator will verify the medical staff's identity through the mobile device using a smart card and password mechanism. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain patients' vital signs data such as their blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature, etc.. Besides, the scheme includes a time-bounded characteristic that allows the verified staff access to data without having to have to re-authenticate and re-login into the system within a set period of time. Consequently, the time-bounded property also increases the work efficiency of the system administrator and user.",

If AI brings about advances in clinical practice that benefit patients, this is ethically to be welcomed; however, respect for the self-determination of patients and data security must be guaranteed. Traceability and explainability of the algorithms would strengthen trust in automated decision-making and enable ultimate medical responsibility. It should be noted that algorithms are only as good and unbiased as the data used to train them. If the use of AI is likely to lead to a loss of skills on the part of doctors (deskilling), this must be counteracted, for example through improved training.

    "title": "Secure Cloud-Based Electronic Health Records: Cross-Patient Block-Level Deduplication with Blockchain Auditing.",
    "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the exponential growth of digital information poses significant challenges in data management. In recent years, the adoption of cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing schemes has yielded numerous advantages like improved accessibility, availability, and enhanced interoperability. However, the centralized nature of cloud storage presents challenges in terms of information storage, privacy protection, and security. Despite several approaches that have been presented to ensure secure deduplication of similar EHRs, the validation of data integrity without a third-party auditor (TPA) remains a persistent task. Because involving a TPA raises concerns about the confidentiality and privacy of crucial healthcare information. To tackle this challenge, a novel cloud storage auditing technique is proposed that incorporates cross-patient block-level deduplication while upholding strong privacy protection, ensuring that EHR is not compromised. Here, we introduced blockchain technology to achieve integrity verification, thus eliminating the need for a TPA by providing a decentralized and transparent mechanism. Additionally, an index for all EHRs has been generated to facilitate block-level duplicate checks and employ a novel strategy to prevent adversaries from acquiring original information saved in the cloud storage. The security of the proposed approach is established against factorization attacks and decrypt exponent attacks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the superior efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of file authenticator generation, challenge creation, and proof verification to other existing client-side deduplication approaches.",

    "title": "A secure healthcare 5.0 system based on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning technique.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as \"Smart Healthcare.\" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection.",

    "title": "Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Ensuring Security and Privacy Aspects in Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) concept materialized worldwide in complex ecosystems, the related data security and privacy issues became apparent. While the system elements and their communication paths could be protected individually, generic, ecosystem-wide approaches were sought after as well. On a parallel timeline to IoT, the concept of distributed ledgers and blockchains came into the technological limelight. Blockchains offer many advantageous features in relation to enhanced security, anonymity, increased capacity, and peer-to-peer capabilities. Although blockchain technology can provide IoT with effective and efficient solutions, there are many challenges related to various aspects of integrating these technologies. While security, anonymity/data privacy, and smart contract-related features are apparently advantageous for blockchain technologies (BCT), there are challenges in relation to storage capacity/scalability, resource utilization, transaction rate scalability, predictability, and legal issues. This paper provides a systematic review on state-of-the-art approaches of BCT and IoT integration, specifically in order to solve certain security- and privacy-related issues. The paper first provides a brief overview of BCT and IoT's basic principles, including their architecture, protocols and consensus algorithms, characteristics, and the challenges of integrating them. Afterwards, it describes the survey methodology, including the search strategy, eligibility criteria, selection results, and characteristics of the included articles. Later, we highlight the findings of this study which illustrates different works that addressed the integration of blockchain technology and IoT to tackle various aspects of privacy and security, which are followed by a categorization of applications that have been investigated with different characteristics, such as their primary information, objective, development level, target application, type of blockchain and platform, consensus algorithm, evaluation environment and metrics, future works or open issues (if any), and further notes for consideration. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of all articles is included from an architectural and operational perspective. Finally, we cover major gaps and future considerations that can be taken into account when integrating blockchain technology with IoT.",

In this process, the private medical data will be disclosed by man in the middle attack. Thus, the archived data for healthcare services would be protected by non-standardized security policy by healthcare service provider (HSP) because HIPAA only defines the security rules. In this paper, we adopted the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for security framework on wearable devices, so healthcare applications using this framework could support the confidentiality easily. The framework developed as dynamic loadable module targeted for lightweight microcontroller such as msp430 within embedded operating system. The performance was shown that the module can support the real-time encryption using electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. In this regard, the processing load for enabling security is distributed to wearable devices, and the customized data protection method could be composed by HSP for a trusted healthcare service.",

    "title": "Analysis of Agriculture and Food Supply Chain through Blockchain and IoT with Light Weight Cluster Head.",
    "abstract": "By 2050, the world's population will have increased by 34%, to more than 9 billion people, needing a 70% increase in food production. Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain's transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item's authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system. By 2050, the world's population will need a 70% increase in food production. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. This article provides a transparent, decentralized, and intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

    "title": "Outsourcing medical data analyses: can technology overcome legal, privacy, and confidentiality issues?",
    "abstract": "Medical data are gold mines for deriving the knowledge that could change the course of a single patient's life or even the health of the entire population. A data analyst needs to have full access to relevant data, but full access may be denied by privacy and confidentiality of medical data legal regulations, especially when the data analyst is not affiliated with the data owner. Our first objective was to analyze the privacy and confidentiality issues and the associated regulations pertaining to medical data, and to identify technologies to properly address these issues. Our second objective was to develop a procedure to protect medical data in such a way that the outsourced analyst would be capable of doing analyses on protected data and the results would be comparable, if not the same, as if they had been done on the original data. Specifically, our hypothesis was there would not be a difference between the outsourced decision trees built on encrypted data and the ones built on original data. Using formal definitions, we developed an algorithm to protect medical data for outsourced analyses. The algorithm was applied to publicly available datasets (N=30) from the medical and life sciences fields. The analyses were performed on the original and the protected datasets and the results of the analyses were compared. Bootstrapped paired t tests for 2 dependent samples were used to test whether the mean differences in size, number of leaves, and the accuracy of the original and the encrypted decision trees were significantly different. The decision trees built on encrypted data were virtually the same as those built on original data. Out of 30 datasets, 100% of the trees had identical accuracy. The size of a tree and the number of leaves was different only once (1/30, 3%, P=.19). The proposed algorithm encrypts a file with plain text medical data into an encrypted file with the data protected in such a way that external data analyses are still possible. The results show that the results of analyses on original and on protected data are identical or comparably similar. The approach addresses the privacy and confidentiality issues that arise with medical data and is adherent to strict legal rules in the United States and Europe regarding the processing of the medical data.",

    "title": "Privacy-Oriented Technique for COVID-19 Contact Tracing (PROTECT) Using Homomorphic Encryption: Design and Development Study.",
    "abstract": "Various techniques are used to support contact tracing, which has been shown to be highly effective against the COVID-19 pandemic. To apply the technology, either quarantine authorities should provide the location history of patients with COVID-19, or all users should provide their own location history. This inevitably exposes either the patient's location history or the personal location history of other users. Thus, a privacy issue arises where the public good (via information release) comes in conflict with privacy exposure risks. The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system that does not expose the location information of the patient with COVID-19 to other users of the system, or the location information of the users to the quarantine authorities. We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new, secure proximity computation method. We developed a mobile app for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method, and we verified their effectiveness. The proposed app and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of patients with COVID-19 released by the quarantine authorities and that of the user saved on the user's local device. We also found that this contact tracing smartphone app can identify whether the user has been in contact with such patients within a reasonable time. This newly developed method for contact tracing shares location information by using homomorphic encryption, without exposing the location information of patients with COVID-19 and other users. Homomorphic encryption is challenging to apply to practical issues despite its high security value. In this study, however, we have designed a system using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren scheme that is applicable to a reasonable size and developed it to an operable format. The developed app and web service can help contact tracing for not only the COVID-19 pandemic but also other epidemics.",

    "title": "Secure Biomedical Document Protection Framework to Ensure Privacy Through Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "In the recent health care era, biomedical documents play a crucial role, and they contain much evidence-based documentation associated with many stakeholders data. Protecting those confidential research documents is more difficult and effective, and a significant process in the medical-based research domain. Those bio-documentation related to health care and other relevant community-valued data are suggested by medical professionals and processed. Many traditional security mechanisms such as akteonline and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are used to protect the biomedical documents as they consider the problem of non-repudiation and data integrity related to the retrieval and storage of documents. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that improves protection in terms of cost and response time related to biomedical documents. In this research work, blockchain-based biomedical document protection framework (BBDPF) is proposed, which includes blockchain-based biomedical data protection (BBDP) and blockchain-based biomedical data retrieval (BBDR) algorithms. BBDP and BBDR algorithms provide consistency on the data to prevent data modification and interception of confidential data with proper data validation. Both the algorithms have strong cryptographic mechanisms to withstand post-quantum security risks, ensuring the integrity of biomedical document retrieval and non-deny of data retrieval transactions. In the performance analysis, Ethereum blockchain infrastructure is deployed BBDPF and smart contracts using Solidity language. In the performance analysis, request time and searching time are determined based on the number of request to ensure data integrity, non-repudiation, and smart contracts for the proposed hybrid model as it gets increased gradually. A modified prototype is built with a web-based interface to prove the concept and evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results revealed that the proposed framework renders data integrity, non-repudiation, and support for smart contracts with Query Notary Service, MedRec, MedShare, and Medlock.",

The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) and the health information system (HIS) have raised it to greater prominence. These systems and their intended benefits are rendered less effective through a low level of trust between the stakeholders. The potential reciprocal relationship between accountability and trust is investigated. A literature study examines both concepts and their interrelationship. The accountability and audit controls provided by the NIST SP 800-53 security guide and the ISO 27799 security standard are extracted, collated and expanded to strengthen the accountability mechanisms within an HIS security program. A dedicated set of accountability controls (NIM) which is specific to the healthcare environment is produced. It is proposed that through the strengthening of the accountability function of the HIS, its level of trustworthiness may be improved.",

    "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine or non-face-to-face medicine has increased significantly. In practice, various types of medical images are essential to achieve effective telemedicine. Medical image encryption algorithms play an irreplaceable role in the fast and secure transmission and storage of these medical images. However, most of the existing medical image encryption algorithms are full encryption algorithms, which are inefficient and time-consuming, so they are not suitable for emergency medical scenarios. To improve the efficiency of encryption, a small number of works have focused on partial or selective encryption algorithms for medical images, in which different levels of encryption strategies were adopted for different information content regions of medical images. However, these encryption algorithms have inadequate security more or less. In this paper, based on the Logistic map, we designed an improved variable dimension map. Then, an encryption algorithm for medical images was proposed based on it. This algorithm has two modes: (1) full encryption mode and (2) semi-full encryption mode, which can better adapt to different medical scenarios, respectively. In full encryption mode, all pixels of medical images are encrypted by using the confusion-diffusion structure. In semi-full encryption mode, the region of interest of medical images is extracted. The confusion was first adopted to encrypt the region of interest, and then, the diffusion was adopted to encrypt the entire image. In addition, no matter which encryption mode is used, the algorithm provides the function of medical image integrity verification. The proposed algorithm was simulated and analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness. The results show that in semi-full encryption mode, the algorithm has good security performance and lower time consumption; while in full encryption mode, the algorithm has better security performance and is acceptable in time.",

To achieve high detection rate, we present a novel network anomaly detection system with optimized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (ODS) and regression basic probability assignment (RBPA) function. In this model, we add weights for each sensor to optimize DS evidence theory according to its previous predict accuracy. And RBPA employs sensor's regression ability to address complex network.

    "title": "Towards a Stakeholder-Oriented Blockchain-Based Architecture for Electronic Health Records: Design Science Research Study.",
    "abstract": "Data security issues still constitute the main reason for the sluggish dissemination of electronic health records (EHRs). Given that blockchain technology offers the possibility to verify transactions through a decentralized network, it may serve as a solution to secure health-related data. Therefore, we have identified stakeholder-specific requirements and propose a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs, while referring to the already existing scientific discussions on the potential of blockchain for use in EHRs. This study aimed to introduce blockchain technology for EHRs, based on identifying stakeholders and systematically eliciting their requirements, and to discuss the key benefits (KBs) and key challenges (KCs) of blockchain technology in the context of EHRs. The blockchain-based architecture was developed in the framework of the design science research paradigm. The requirements were identified using a structured literature review and interviews with nine health care experts. Subsequently, the proposed architecture was evaluated using 4 workshops with 15 participants. We identified three major EHR stakeholder groups and 34 respective requirements. On this basis, we developed a five-layer architecture. The subsequent evaluation of the artifact was followed by the discussion of 12 KBs and 12 KCs of a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs. To address the KCs, we derived five recommendations for action for science and practice. Our findings indicate that blockchain technology offers considerable potential to advance EHRs. Improvements to currently available EHR solutions are expected, for instance, in the areas of data security, traceability, and automation by smart contracts. Future research could examine the patient's acceptance of blockchain-based EHRs and cost-benefit analyses.",

    "title": "Privacy and information security risks in a technology platform for home-based chronic disease rehabilitation and education.",
    "abstract": "Privacy and information security are important for all healthcare services, including home-based services. We have designed and implemented a prototype technology platform for providing home-based healthcare services. It supports a personal electronic health diary and enables secure and reliable communication and interaction with peers and healthcare personnel. The platform runs on a small computer with a dedicated remote control. It is connected to the patient's TV and to a broadband Internet. The platform has been tested with home-based rehabilitation and education programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of our work, a risk assessment of privacy and security aspects has been performed, to reveal actual risks and to ensure adequate information security in this technical platform. Risk assessment was performed in an iterative manner during the development process. Thus, security solutions have been incorporated into the design from an early stage instead of being included as an add-on to a nearly completed system. We have adapted existing risk management methods to our own environment, thus creating our own method. Our method conforms to ISO's standard for information security risk management. A total of approximately 50 threats and possible unwanted incidents were identified and analysed. Among the threats to the four information security aspects: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and quality; confidentiality threats were identified as most serious, with one threat given an unacceptable level of High risk. This is because health-related personal information is regarded as sensitive. Availability threats were analysed as low risk, as the aim of the home programmes is to provide education and rehabilitation services; not for use in acute situations or for continuous health monitoring. Most of the identified threats are applicable for healthcare services intended for patients or citizens in their own homes. Confidentiality risks in home are different from in a more controlled environment such as a hospital; and electronic equipment located in private homes and communicating via Internet, is more exposed to unauthorised access. By implementing the proposed measures, it has been possible to design a home-based service which ensures the necessary level of information security and privacy.",

    "abstract": "In 2014, the vast majority of published biomedical research is still hidden behind paywalls rather than open access. For more than a decade, similar restrictions over other digitally available content have engendered illegal activity. Music file sharing became rampant in the late 1990s as communities formed around new ways to share. The frequency and scale of cyber-attacks against commercial and government interests has increased dramatically. Massive troves of classified government documents have become public through the actions of a few. Yet we have not seen significant growth in the illegal sharing of peer-reviewed academic articles. Should we truly expect that biomedical publishing is somehow at less risk than other content-generating industries? What of the larger threat--a \"Biblioleaks\" event--a database breach and public leak of the substantial archives of biomedical literature? As the expectation that all research should be available to everyone becomes the norm for a younger generation of researchers and the broader community, the motivations for such a leak are likely to grow. We explore the feasibility and consequences of a Biblioleaks event for researchers, journals, publishers, and the broader communities of doctors and the patients they serve.",

However, due to the extensiveness of IoT technology, the heterogeneity and diversity of the device structure, the number of attacks against IoT has increased dramatically, so we need a method that can effectively and actively determine safety. Considering the diversity of the terminal structure of IoT, a security method for the IoT terminal based on structural balance, method objectivity, and reliability is currently a challenging task. This paper introduces the idea of rate of change in mathematics into trust analysis, and forms three attribute sets based on trust interval and rate of change: discrete interval, change range, and change frequency. By calculating the above attributes of the entity's trust value, the entity's trust situation is obtained, and an overall assessment of the terminal entity's trust situation is made from the three levels of completeness, accuracy and objectivity. Under the premise of reducing encryption and other means, the above method can evaluate the trust state of the IoT terminal from the perspective of the data, and this evaluation method can provide a basis for the judgment of the IoT terminal more objectively and accurately.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the information disclosures in two biobank consent documents used by biobanks operating under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The aim of the analysis is to investigate how these documents inform potential sample donors about possible future uses of biobank data. The findings suggest that the consent documents provide potentially misleading information regarding the range of possible future uses of biobank data. Based on these information disclosures, potential sample donors may reasonably believe that the data can only be used for a narrowly defined range of research purposes. However, the range of lawful uses of the data is much broader and less clearly defined. Consent provided based on misleading information is not morally transformative, even if it were legally valid. To facilitate morally transformative biobank consent, this paper provides two recommendations for information disclosure to potential sample donors regarding future uses of biobank data: first, potential sample donors should be informed about the legal scope of consent; and second, they should be informed about the full range of lawful uses of biobank data.",

    "abstract": "Research derived from the application of information and communication technologies in medicine operates in a context involving the globalization of collecting, sharing, storage, transfer and re-use of personal health data. Health data computerization within Clinical Information Systems (as Electronic Healthcare Records) should allow the re-use of health data for clinical research and public health purposes. One of the objects allowing the integration of healthcare and research information systems is the health data-warehouse (DWH). However, ethical-legal frameworks in force are not adapted to these DWHs because they were not conceived for re-using data in a different context than the one of their acquisition. For that matter, access modalities to data-warehouses must ensure the respect of patients' rights: information to the patient, as well as confidentiality and security. Through a bibliography research, some Ethical, legal and Social Issues (ELSI) have been identified: Patients' rights Modalities of implementation of the DWs; Solidarity and common good; Transparency and Trust. Comparative analysis between the Directive 95/46/CE and the \"Proposal for regulation on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data\" shows that this regulation pretends allowing the re-use of key-coded data when aimed at a scientific purpose. However, since this new regulation does not align with the ethical and legal requirements at an operational level, a Code of practice on secondary use of Medical Data in scientific Research Projects has been developed at the European Level. This Code provides guidance for Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) and will help to propose practical solutions to overcome the issue of the re-use of data for research purposes.",

    "title": "BBNSF: Blockchain-Based Novel Secure Framework Using RP2-RSA and ASR-ANN Technique for IoT Enabled Healthcare Systems.",
    "abstract": "The wearable healthcare equipment is primarily designed to alert patients of any specific health conditions or to act as a useful tool for treatment or follow-up. With the growth of technologies and connectivity, the security of these devices has become a growing concern. The lack of security awareness amongst novice users and the risk of several intermediary attacks for accessing health information severely endangers the use of IoT-enabled healthcare systems. In this paper, a blockchain-based secure data storage system is proposed along with a user authentication and health status prediction system. Firstly, this work utilizes reversed public-private keys combined Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RP -RSA) algorithm for providing security. Secondly, feature selection is completed by employing the correlation factor-induced salp swarm optimization algorithm (CF-SSOA). Finally, health status classification is performed using advanced weight initialization adapted SignReLU activation function-based artificial neural network (ASR-ANN) which classifies the status as normal and abnormal. Meanwhile, the abnormal measures are stored in the corresponding patient blockchain. Here, blockchain technology is used to store medical data securely for further analysis. The proposed model has achieved an accuracy of 95.893% and is validated by comparing it with other baseline techniques. On the security front, the proposed RP -RSA attains a 96.123% security level.",

    "title": "A Novel Reversible Multiple Medical Image Watermarking for Health Information System.",
    "abstract": "The exponential augmentation of information and communication technologies has appreciably shifted panorama of Health Information System (HIS), drawing keen interests of the researchers to address the challenges in protecting the medical data. Digital Watermarking therefore gained wide popularity as an entrusted measure to ensure the security. Literature reports wide assortment of imaging approaches for digital watermarking; however its perspectives in the HIS have received meager attention, especially in the reversible watermarking context. This paper presents wavelet based novel reversible watermarking approach which imperceptibly embeds multiple watermarks like patient diagnosis detail, Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, doctor's digital signature and diagnostic code for image retrieval. The proposed wavelet based approach exploits the quantization function to embed multiple watermarks and uses a novel tracking key to recover the original medical image. The algorithm has been analyzed on various medical imaging modalities (MRI, CT, MRA, US images of size 512 X 512), considering various image processing attacks. Experimental results signify highest hiding capacity of 91,136 bits with PSNR of 44.52 dB. The proposed algorithm adheres to strict necessities concerning the tolerable modifications in the medical images. The technique addresses the issues related with HIS namely data integrity, authentication, confidentiality protection, efficient data management, retrieval of image and additionally fulfill tamper detection on the entire image for ensuring the integrity of the medical image.",

However, as the industrial world is currently in its initial stage of adopting full-stack development solutions with IIoT, there is a need to address the arising challenges. In this regard, researchers have proposed IIoT architectures based on different architectural layers and emerging technologies for the end-to-end integration of IIoT systems. In this paper, we review and compare three widely accepted IIoT reference architectures and present a state-of-the-art review of conceptual and experimental IIoT architectures from the literature. We identified scalability, interoperability, security, privacy, reliability, and low latency as the main IIoT architectural requirements and detailed how the current architectures address these challenges by using emerging technologies such as edge/fog computing, blockchain, SDN, 5G, Machine Learning, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Finally, we discuss the relation between the current challenges and emergent technologies and present some opportunities and directions for future research work.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technologies have evolved in recent years, as have the use of personal health record (PHR) data. Initially, only the financial domain benefited from Blockchain technologies. Due to efficient distribution format and data integrity security, however, these technologies have demonstrated potential in other areas, such as PHR data in the healthcare domain. Applying Blockchain to PHR data faces different challenges than applying it to financial transactions via crypto-currency. To propose and discuss an architectural model of a Blockchain platform named \"OmniPHR Multi-Blockchain\" to address key challenges associated with geographical distribution of PHR data. We analyzed the current literature to identify critical barriers faced when applying Blockchain technologies to distribute PHR data. We propose an architecture model and describe a prototype developed to evaluate and address these challenges. The OmniPHR Multi-Blockchain architecture yielded promising results for scenarios involving distributed PHR data. The project demonstrated a viable and beneficial alternative for processing geographically distributed PHR data with performance comparable with conventional methods. Blockchain's implementation tools have evolved, but the domain of healthcare still faces many challenges concerning distribution and interoperability. This study empirically demonstrates an alternative architecture that enables the distributed processing of PHR data via Blockchain technologies.",

    "abstract": "The lack of data outsourcing in healthcare management systems slows down the intercommunication and information sharing between different entities. A standard solution is outsourcing the electronic health record (EHR) to a cloud service provider (CSP). The outsourcing of the EHR should be performed securely without compromising the CSP functionalities. Searchable encryption would be a viable approach to ensure the confidentiality of the data without compromising searchability and accessibility. However, most existing searchable encryption solutions use centralised architecture. These systems have trust issues as not all the CSPs are fully trusted or honest. To address these problems, we explore blockchain technology with smart contract applications to construct a decentralised system with auditable yet immutable data storage and access. First, we propose a blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme for EHR storage and updates in a decentralised fashion. The proposed scheme supports confidentiality of the outsourced EHR, keyword search functionalities, verifiability of the user and the server, storage immutability, and dynamic updates of EHRs. Next, we implement a prototype using JavaScript and Solidity on the Ethereum platform to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed solution. Finally, we compare the performance and security of the proposed scheme against existing solutions. The result indicates that the proposed scheme is practical while providing the desired security features and functional requirements.",

    "abstract": "Vaccine, as an irreplaceable means in herd immunization, is widely applied in prevention for communicable diseases. However, adverse impacts were frequently incurred by fake or expired vaccines in China. Given the necessity of vaccine anticounterfeiting, blockchain-based transaction platform could be practiced as a solution in addressing the issue; however, most of the available experiments focused on single-chain structured design with inventible limitations. Accordingly, exploration for the effectiveness and feasibility of mixed-chains structured platform for vaccine anticounterfeiting and tracing is essentially required. Both public chain and private chain were inserted in anticounterfeiting and tracing platform designing process, which were subsequently simulated in Ethereum environment. By recording different information in public chain and private chain, partial information privacy protection requirements are realized. The transfer identification module realized the function of vaccine quality supervision and solves the problem of EPC label replication. . Compared with the traditional single-structured design, completeness information could be visited by all stakeholders in double-chain structure, including vaccine suppliers, National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), vaccine purchasers, and the vaccinated. Double-chain structured system for vaccine anticounterfeiting and tracing is more effective.",

    "title": "The myth of secure computing.",
    "abstract": "Few senior executives pay a whole lot of attention to computer security. They either hand off responsibility to their technical people or bring in consultants. But given the stakes involved, an arm's-length approach is extremely unwise. According to industry estimates, security breaches affect 90% of all businesses every year and cost some $17 billion. Fortunately, the authors say, senior executives don't need to learn about the more arcane aspects of their company's IT systems in order to take a hands-on approach. Instead, they should focus on the familiar task of managing risk. Their role should be to assess the business value of their information assets, determine the likelihood that those assets will be compromised, and then tailor a set of risk abatement processes to their company's particular vulnerabilities. This approach, which views computer security as an operational rather than a technical challenge, is akin to a classic quality assurance program in that it attempts to avoid problems rather than fix them and involves all employees, not just IT staffers. The goal is not to make computer systems completely secure--that's impossible--but to reduce the business risk to an acceptable level. This article looks at the types of threats a company is apt to face. It also examines the processes a general manager should spearhead to lessen the likelihood of a successful attack. The authors recommend eight processes in all, ranging from deciding how much protection each digital asset deserves to insisting on secure software to rehearsing a response to a security breach. The important thing to realize, they emphasize, is that decisions about digital security are not much different from other cost-benefit decisions. The tools general managers bring to bear on other areas of the business are good models for what they need to do in this technical space.",

    "abstract": "Medical records management had always been a challenging in healthcare sector. Traditionally, medical records are handled either manually or electronically that are under the stewardship of hospitals/healthcare institutions. A patient centric approach is the new paradigm where patient is an inherent part of the healthcare ecosystem controlling the access and sharing of his/her personal medical care information. Medical care information requires robust security and privacy. Also there are other issues like confidentiality, interoperability, scalability, cost efficiency and timeliness that need to be addressed. To achieve these objectives, this paper proposes a novel-scalable patient centric yet privacy preserving framework for efficient and secure electronic medical records management. In addition, proposed system generates a unified trusted record and authentication role mapping for enforcing secure access control for medical records using complex encryption algorithms. This paper identifies 13 key performance factors for performance comparison of proposed framework with traditional models. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain acted as a benchmark platform for performance evaluation of MRBSChain on the basis of three metrics (transaction cost, average block time and deployment cost).At last, a comparative analysis of MRBSChain with other state of art blockchain systems on the basis of execution time is presented in the paper.",

    "title": "System Construction of Athlete Health Information Protection Based on Machine Learning Algorithm.",
    "abstract": "The exercise volume and exercise level can be quantitatively assessed by measuring and collecting athletes' health and exercise data. The protection of athletes' health information has lately become an important research topic due to a rise in sports activities. However, due to the nature of the data and the limits of protection models, protecting athlete health data is a complex undertaking. Machine learning and blockchain have caused worldwide technological innovation, and it is bound to bring deep modifications to the sports industry. The main purpose of blockchain is security, decentralization, traceability, and credibility of the athlete's health data protection and gathering system. To progress and increase the sports industry and methodically assess the physical fitness of sportspersons' health information, this study concentrates on the Machine Learning and Blockchain-based Athlete Health Information Protection System (MLB-AHIPS) proposed in the sports industry. The ML technique is utilized to clean and handle the information to comprehend the recognition and secure managing of the sportsperson's fitness information. The system uses attribute-based access control, which permits dynamic and fine-grained access to athlete health data, and then stores the health data in the blockchain, which can be secured and tamper-proof by expressing the respective smart contracts. The simulation outcomes illustrate that the suggested MLB-AHIPS attains a high accuracy ratio of 97.8%, security ratio of 98.3%, an efficiency ratio of 97.1%, scalability ratio of 98.9%, and data access rate of 97.2% compared to other existing approach.",

As these enterprisewide information systems go online, however the risk of compromising patient confidentiality increases dramatically. State laws regarding patient confidentiality vary considerably, and national standards have not yet been established. Therefore, health systems need to take steps to ensure that their computerized patient records remain secure and confidential to avoid being found in violation of patients' legal right to privacy.",

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Truly Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for Telecare Medical Information Systems.",
    "abstract": "Significant development of information technologies has made Telecare Medical Information Systems (TMISs) increasingly popular. In a TMIS, patients upload their medical data through smart devices to obtain a doctor's diagnosis. However, these smart devices have limited computing and storage capacities, so it is difficult to store substantial patient information and to support time-consuming operations. Moreover, although many three-factor authentication protocols have been proposed for TMISs, the problems of privacy leaks and other security flaws are serious. In addition, authentication factors are verified at the user side in most protocols, giving users a high level of trust and resulting in a potential lack of security. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient truly three-factor authentication protocol for TMISs. In our proposed protocol, three factors (i.e., password, smart card and biometrics) are verified at the server side, which reduces the storage and computational burden of the user side. Additionally, our proposed protocol uses only lightweight operators and is thus efficient. A formal proof analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol is provably secure in the random oracle model. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol is very efficient and suitable for TMISs.",

    "abstract": "The successful implementation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) into clinical practice requires patient genomic data to be shared between stakeholders in multiple settings. This creates a number of barriers to widespread adoption of PGx, including privacy concerns related to the storage and movement of identifiable genomic data. Informatic solutions that support secure and equitable data access for genomic data are therefore important to PGx. Here we propose a methodology that uses smart contracts implemented on a blockchain-based framework, PGxChain, to address this issue. The design requirements for PGxChain were identified through a systematic literature review, identifying technical challenges and barriers impeding the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics. These requirements included security and privacy, accessibility, interoperability, traceability and legal compliance. A proof-of-concept implementation based on Ethereum was then developed that met the design requirements. PGxChain's performance was examined using Hyperledger Caliper for latency, throughput, and transaction success rate. The findings clearly indicate that blockchain technology offers considerable potential to advance pharmacogenetic data sharing, particularly with regard to PGx data security and privacy, large-scale accessibility of PGx data, PGx data interoperability between multiple health care providers and compliance with data-sharing laws and regulations.",

Unfortunately, the detection of slow port scans in company networks is challenging due to the massive amount of network data. This paper proposes an innovative approach for preprocessing flow-based data which is specifically tailored to the detection of slow port scans. The preprocessing chain generates new objects based on flow-based data aggregated over time windows while taking domain knowledge as well as additional knowledge about the network structure into account. The computed objects are used as input for the further analysis. Based on these objects, we propose two different approaches for detection of slow port scans. One approach is unsupervised and uses sequential hypothesis testing whereas the other approach is supervised and uses classification algorithms. We compare both approaches with existing port scan detection algorithms on the flow-based CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that the proposed approaches achieve better detection rates and exhibit less false alarms than similar algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Many works are designed to improve efficiency or enhance security and privacy of publicly-auditable cloud storage. However, building timeliness for cloud storage has not been well studied. Few works presented time-sensitive cloud storage and only focused on specific issues, such as the earliest creation time of files or resistance against a procrastinating auditor. Therefore, there leaves an absence of building traceable timeliness for publicly-auditable cloud storage. In this paper, we propose a solution PPTPS to build Privacy-Preserving auditable service with Traceable timeliness for Public cloud Storage. First, we use the security properties of the blockchain to provide a time-stamp for each phase. It enables the timeliness of cloud storage. Second, we construct efficient publicly-verifiable cloud storage. Third, a customized random mask solution is proposed to prevent privacy leakage during the auditing phase. Moreover, we formally proved the security of PPTPS. At last, experimental results demonstrate that PPTPS is economically sound and technically viable.",

We are confronted with an unprecedented expansion in ways to share and access information and experiences, to express ourselves and communicate. Yet while these changes have undoubtedly provided many benefits for health, from information sharing to improved surveillance and diagnostics, they also open up many potential threats. These come in many forms. Here we review some the pressing issues of concern; discrimination; breaches of privacy; iatrogenesis; disinformation and misinformation or 'fake news' and cyber-attacks. These have the potential to impact negatively on the health and wellbeing of individuals as well as entire communities and nations.

    "title": "Defense Against Chip Cloning Attacks Based on Fractional Hopfield Neural Networks.",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a state-of-the-art application of fractional hopfield neural networks (FHNNs) to defend against chip cloning attacks, and provides insight into the reason that the proposed method is superior to physically unclonable functions (PUFs). In the past decade, PUFs have been evolving as one of the best types of hardware security. However, the development of the PUFs has been somewhat limited by its implementation cost, its temperature variation effect, its electromagnetic interference effect, the amount of entropy in it, etc. Therefore, it is imperative to discover, through promising mathematical methods and physical modules, some novel mechanisms to overcome the aforementioned weaknesses of the PUFs. Motivated by this need, in this paper, we propose applying the FHNNs to defend against chip cloning attacks. At first, we implement the arbitrary-order fractor of a FHNN. Secondly, we describe the implementation cost of the FHNNs. Thirdly, we propose the achievement of the constant-order performance of a FHNN when ambient temperature varies. Fourthly, we analyze the electrical performance stability of the FHNNs under electromagnetic disturbance conditions. Fifthly, we study the amount of entropy of the FHNNs. Lastly, we perform experiments to analyze the pass-band width of the fractor of an arbitrary-order FHNN and the defense against chip cloning attacks capability of the FHNNs. In particular, the capabilities of defense against chip cloning attacks, anti-electromagnetic interference, and anti-temperature variation of a FHNN are illustrated experimentally in detail. Some significant advantages of the FHNNs are that their implementation cost is considerably lower than that of the PUFs, their electrical performance is much more stable than that of the PUFs under different temperature conditions, their electrical performance stability of the FHNNs under electromagnetic disturbance conditions is much more robust than that of the PUFs, and their amount of entropy is significantly higher than that of the PUFs with the same rank circuit scale.",

LBS systems facilitate the users with intelligent services by collecting an accurate location information. Due to the frequent exchange rate of the location information in an open environment, VANETs are inherently susceptible to privacy and security attacks. In past, many schemes have been proposed to ensure the privacy and security of exchanged location information; but fail to deploy in practical VANETs. At the same time, system efficiency is compromised which is another primary requirement of VANETs. Leveraging the semi-decentralized and lightweight nature of consortium blockchain technology, and Certificateless conditional privacy protection scheme to reduce the node authentication overhead, this paper introduces Consortium Blockchain assisted Certificateless Conditional Privacy Protection scheme to address the aforementioned challenges. Additionally, the proposed scheme has ability to develop anonymous regions for a particular time stamp ensuring the location privacy of vehicles. Rigorous security analysis and experiments show the practicality and resilience to various attack models, and achieve ADP 83% with maximum malicious attacks. Comparing with existing state of the art methods, the proposed scheme exhibits the privacy improvement and low computational complexity.",

    "title": "BSF-EHR: Blockchain Security Framework for Electronic Health Records of Patients.",
    "abstract": "In the current epoch of smart homes and cities, personal data such as patients' names, diseases and addresses are often violated. This is frequently associated with the safety of the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients. EHRs have numerous benefits worldwide, but at present, EHR information is subject to considerable security and privacy issues. This paper proposes a way to provide a secure solution to these issues. Previous sophisticated techniques dealing with the protection of EHRs usually make data inaccessible to patients. These techniques struggle to balance data confidentiality, patient demand and constant interaction with provider data. Blockchain technology solves the above problems since it distributes information in a transactional and decentralized manner. The usage of blockchain technology could help the health sector to balance the accessibility and privacy of EHRs. This paper proposes a blockchain security framework (BSF) to effectively and securely store and keep EHRs. It presents a safe and proficient means of acquiring medical information for doctors, patients and insurance agents while protecting the patient's data. This work aims to examine how our proposed framework meets the security needs of doctors, patients and third parties and how the structure addresses safety and confidentiality concerns in the healthcare sector. Simulation outcomes show that this framework efficiently protects EHR data.",

Telecare Medical Information Systems (TMIS) provides a facility by which a patient can communicate to a doctor through a medical server via internet from home. To hide the secret information of both parties (a server and a patient), an authentication mechanism is needed in TMIS. In 2013, Khan and Kumari proposed the authentication schemes for TMIS. In this paper, we have shown that Khan and Kumari's scheme is insecure against off-line password guessing attack. We have also shown that Khan and Kumari's scheme does not provide any security if the password of a patient is compromised. To improve the security and efficiency, a new authentication scheme for TMIS has been proposed in this paper. Further, the proposed scheme can resist all possible attacks and has better performance than the related schemes published earlier.",

    "title": "An efficient blockchain-based authentication scheme with transferability.",
    "abstract": "In the development of web applications, the rapid advancement of Internet technologies has brought unprecedented opportunities and increased the demand for user authentication schemes. Before the emergence of blockchain technology, establishing trust between two unfamiliar entities relied on a trusted third party for identity verification. However, the failure or malicious behavior of such a trusted third party could undermine such authentication schemes (e.g., single points of failure, credential leaks). A secure authorization system is another requirement of user authentication schemes, as users must authorize other entities to act on their behalf in some situations. If the transfer of authentication permissions is not adequately restricted, security risks such as unauthorized transfer of permissions to entities may occur. Some research has proposed blockchain-based decentralized user authentication solutions to address these risks and enhance availability and auditability. However, as we know, most proposed schemes that allow users to transfer authentication permissions to other entities require significant gas consumption when deployed and triggered in smart contracts. To address this issue, we proposed an authentication scheme with transferability solely based on hash functions. By combining one-time passwords with Hashcash, the scheme can limit the number of times permissions can be transferred while ensuring security. Furthermore, due to its reliance solely on hash functions, our proposed authentication scheme has an absolute advantage regarding computational complexity and gas consumption in smart contracts. Additionally, we have deployed smart contracts on the Goerli test network and demonstrated the practicality and efficiency of this authentication scheme.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of managed behavioral health care has increased the value of data describing outcomes of mental health treatment. At the same time, increased development of the national information infrastructure and other computer linkage systems has facilitated the flow of information among a wide network of data systems. These two developments create a dynamic tension between the need to share information and the need to protect the privacy of mental health clients and the confidentiality of their computerized records. This problem is exacerbated by the cost associated with potential solutions. Unfortunately, policy development in this area has lagged behind rapid developments in technology. The mental health administrator must balance the three components of this conflict (the increasing need for information transfer, the protection of confidentiality, and cost) without a great deal of guidance. This article offers recommendations that may help the mental health administrator manage this conflict.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles, or 'drones', appear to offer a flexible, accurate and affordable solution to some of the technical challenges of nature conservation monitoring and law enforcement. However, little attention has been given to their possible social impacts. In this paper, I review the possible social impacts of using drones for conservation, including on safety, privacy, psychological wellbeing, data security and the wider understanding of conservation problems. I argue that negative social impacts are probable under some circumstances and should be of concern for conservation for two reasons: (1) because conservation should follow good ethical practice; and (2) because negative social impacts could undermine conservation effectiveness in the long term. The paper concludes with a call for empirical research to establish whether the identified social risks of drones occur in reality and how they could be mitigated, and for self-regulation of drone use by the conservation sector to ensure good ethical practice and minimise the risk of unintended consequences.",

The entangled photon pairs are produced with a type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion source placed in a central, potentially untrusted, location. The two free-space links cover a distance of 435 m and 1,325 m respectively, producing a total separation of 1,575 m. The system relies on passive polarization analysis units, GPS timing receivers for synchronization, and custom written software to perform the complete QKD protocol including error correction and privacy amplification. Over 6.5 hours during the night, we observed an average raw key generation rate of 565 bits/s, an average quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 4.92%, and an average secure key generation rate of 85 bits/s.",

    "abstract": "People can use their web browser or mobile devices to access web services and applications which are built into these servers. Users have to input their identity and password to login the server. The identity and password may be appropriated by hackers when the network environment is not safe. The multiple secure authentication protocol can improve the security of the network environment. Mobile devices can be used to pass the authentication messages through Wi-Fi or 3G networks to serve as a second communication channel. The content of the message number is not considered in a multiple secure authentication protocol. The more excessive transmission of messages would be easier to collect and decode by hackers. In this paper, we propose two schemes which allow the server to validate the user and reduce the number of messages using the XOR operation. Our schemes can improve the security of the authentication protocol. The experimental results show that our proposed authentication protocols are more secure and effective. In regard to applications of second authentication communication channels for a smart access control system, identity identification and E-wallet, our proposed authentication protocols can ensure the safety of person and property, and achieve more effective security management mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly advancing field of brain-computer (BCI) and brain-to-brain interfaces (BBI) is stimulating interest across various sectors including medicine, entertainment, research, and military. The developers of large-scale brain-computer networks, sometimes dubbed 'Mindplexes' or 'Cloudminds', aim to enhance cognitive functions by distributing them across expansive networks. A key technical challenge is the efficient transmission and storage of information. One proposed solution is employing blockchain technology over Web 3.0 to create decentralised cognitive entities. This paper explores the potential of a decentralised web for coordinating large brain-computer constellations, and its associated benefits, focusing in particular on the conceptual and ethical challenges this innovation may pose pertaining to (1) Identity, (2) Sovereignty (encompassing Autonomy, Authenticity, and Ownership), (3) Responsibility and Accountability, and (4) Privacy, Safety, and Security. We suggest that while a decentralised web can address some concerns and mitigate certain risks, underlying ethical issues persist. Fundamental questions about entity definition within these networks, the distinctions between individuals and collectives, and responsibility distribution within and between networks, demand further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Recently, brain-machine interfacing is very popular that link humans and artificial devices through brain signals which lead to corresponding mobile application as supplementary. The Android platform has developed rapidly because of its good user experience and openness. Meanwhile, these characteristics of this platform, which cause the amazing pace of Android malware, pose a great threat to this platform and data correction during signal transmission of brain-machine interfacing. Many previous works employ various behavioral characteristics to analyze Android application (or app) and detect Android malware to protect signal data secure. However, with the development of Android app, category of Android app tends to be diverse, and the Android malware behavior tends to be complex. This situation makes existing Android malware detections complicated and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a broad analysis, gathering as many behavior characteristics of an app as possible and compare these behavior characteristics in several metrics. First, we extract static and dynamic behavioral characteristic from Android app in an automatic manner. Second, we explain the decision we made in each kind of behavioral characteristic we choose for Android app analysis and Android malware detection. Third, we design a detailed experiment, which compare the efficiency of each kind of behavior characteristic in different aspects. The results of experiment also show Android malware detection performance of these behavior characteristics combine with well-known machine learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The use of the Social Security number (SSN) has expanded significantly since its inception in 1936. Created merely to keep track of the earnings history of U.S. workers for Social Security entitlement and benefit computation purposes, it has come to be used as a nearly universal identifier. Assigned at birth, the SSN enables government agencies to identify individuals in their records and businesses to track an individual's financial information. This article explores the history and meaning of the SSN and the Social Security card, as well as the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) SSN master file, generally known as the Numident. The article also traces the historical expansion of SSN use and the steps SSA has taken to enhance SSN integrity.",

    "title": "Securing oil port logistics: A blockchain framework for efficient and trustworthy trade documents.",
    "abstract": "The oil port logistics involves multiple parties including oil tanker owners, port authorities, customs, oil suppliers, and shipping companies. These parties need to exchange a significant amount of data and documentation related to cargo, such as bills of lading, customs declarations, and cargo manifests. This huge amount of data and documentation provides ample opportunities for data manipulation and corruption. Moreover, physical documentation is slow and prone to errors and manipulation. This data can be securely stored and shared between different parties in a tamper-proof and transparent manner using blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology that employs secure hashing and consensus algorithms that can detect any data modification. Hence, this work proposes a blockchain-enabled immutable, and efficient framework for trade documentation in oil port logistics. The proposed framework provides timely processing of oil trade documents and ensures immutability while increasing trust among the trade entities. In addition, this work implements a private blockchain for the execution of smart contracts, which can ensure that all parties involved in the logistics process comply with pre-agreed rules and regulations. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of transparency, immutability, network latency, throughput, and resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Directive 2011/24/EU was designed to clarify the rights of EU citizens in evaluating, accessing and obtaining reimbursement for cross-border care. Based on three regional case studies, the authors attempted to assess the added value of the Directive in helping clarify issues in to two key areas that have been identified as barriers to cross-border care: liability and data protection. Qualitative case study employing secondary data sources including research of jurisprudence, that set up a Legal framework as a base to investigate liability and data protection in the context of cross-border projects. By means of three case studies that have tackled liability and data protection hurdles in cross-border care implementation, this article attempts to provide insight into legal certainty and uncertainty regarding cross-border care in Europe. The case studies reveal that the Directive has not resolved core uncertainties related to liability and data protection issues within cross-border health care. Some issues related to the practice of cross-border health care in Europe have been further clarified by the Directive and some direction has been given to possible solutions for issues connected to liability and data protection. Directive 2011/24/EU is clearly a transposition of existing regulations on data protection and ECJ case law, plus a set of additional, mostly, voluntary rules that might enhance regional border cooperation. Therefore, as shown in the case studies, a practical and case by case approach is still necessary in designing and providing cross-border care.",

    "title": "A quantum trust and consultative transaction-based blockchain cybersecurity model for healthcare systems.",
    "abstract": "Many researchers have been interested in healthcare cybersecurity for a long time since it can improve the security of patient and health record data. As a result, a lot of research is done in the field of cybersecurity that focuses on the safe exchange of health data between patients and the medical setting. It still has issues with high computational complexity, increased time consumption, and cost complexity, all of which have an impact on the effectiveness and performance of the complete security system. Hence this work proposes a technique called Consultative Transaction Key Generation and Management (CTKGM) to enable secure data sharing in healthcare systems. It generates a unique key pair based on random values with multiplicative operations and time stamps. The patient data is then safely stored in discrete blocks of hash values using the blockchain methodology. The Quantum Trust Reconciliation Agreement Model (QTRAM), which calculates the trust score based on the feedback data, ensures reliable and secure data transfer. By allowing safe communication between patients and the healthcare system based on feedback analysis and trust value, the proposed framework makes a novel contribution to the field. Additionally, during communication, the Tuna Swarm Optimization (TSO) method is employed to validate nonce verification messages. Nonce message verification is a part of QTRAM that helps verify the users during transmission. The effectiveness of the suggested scheme has been demonstrated by comparing the obtained findings with other current state-of-the-art models after a variety of evaluation metrics have been analyzed to test the performance of this security model.",

    "abstract": "The rise of digitalization, sensory devices, cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) technologies enables the design of novel digital product lifecycle management (DPLM) applications for use cases such as manufacturing and delivery of digital products. The verification of the accomplishment/violations of agreements defined in digital contracts is a key task in digital business transactions. However, this verification represents a challenge when validating both the integrity of digital product content and the transactions performed during multiple stages of the DPLM. This paper presents a traceability method for DPLM based on the integration of online and offline verification mechanisms based on blockchain and fingerprinting, respectively. A blockchain lifecycle registration model is used for organizations to register the exchange of digital products in the cloud with partners and/or consumers throughout the DPLM stages as well as to verify the accomplishment of agreements at each DPLM stage. The fingerprinting scheme is used for offline verification of digital product integrity and to register the DPLM logs within digital products, which is useful in either dispute or violation of agreements scenarios. We built a DPLM service prototype based on this method, which was implemented as a cloud computing service. A case study based on the DPLM of audios was conducted to evaluate this prototype. The experimental evaluation revealed the ability of this method to be applied to DPLM in real scenarios in an efficient manner.",

Such a magazine attention outlines the wide impact that the subject has on watchful decision makers. ISO17799 is an emerging standard in information security. In principle there are no reasons for considering it not applicable to the health care sector. In practice, because of both the just conceptual level of the standard and the peculiarities of the health care data and institutions, a lot of analysis and design work need to be invested any time a health care institution decides to deal with the subject. CEN/ENV 12924 is another emerging standard certainly more on the spot of the health care. Nevertheless, it also asks for evident further investigation. The practical case of information security design, implementation, management, and auditing inside a multi-specialty provincial Italian hospital will be described.",

This is unnecessary and may even be detrimental if it leads to caregivers taking the privacy regulations less seriously. Using a number of examples, I will show that in practice the GDPR has more to offer to healthcare professionals than they might think. The GDPR even provides healthcare institutions with the opportunity to request assistance from suppliers of information systems. In the light of recent checks and disciplinary measures implemented by the Dutch Data Protection Authority, additional focus on this opportunity could be the impulse required to bring privacy protection more closely in line with developments in information technology.",

In March and April of 2004, five Chicago area CIOs were surveyed and asked to rank 26 opinion statements that presented possible implementation barriers to the Security Rule. Q-methodology, which is a powerful tool in subjective study, was employed to identify and categorize the viewpoints of CIOs toward the barriers. Two factors (opinion types) that represented two different views--socially motivated CIOs and resources-motivated CIOs--regarding the implementation barriers were extracted. The study sheds light on the attitudes and perceptions of CIOs as they begin rule implementation. Current CIOs can use this information as a way to begin to examine what the prevailing attitude may be at their institution and, therefore, how to begin building a successful implementation strategy.",

    "abstract": "In medical institutions, unauthorized access points and terminals obstruct the stable operation of a large-scale wireless local area network (LAN) system. By establishing a real-time monitoring method to detect such unauthorized wireless devices, we can improve the efficiency of security management. We detected unauthorized wireless devices by using a centralized wireless LAN system and a location detection system at 370 access points at the University of Tokyo Hospital. By storing the detected radio signal strength and location information in a database, we evaluated the risk level from the detection history. We also evaluated the location detection performance in our hospital ward using Wi-Fi tags. The presence of electric waves outside the hospital and those emitted from portable game machines with wireless communication capability was confirmed from the detection result. The location detection performance showed an error margin of approximately 4 m in detection accuracy and approximately 5% in false detection. Therefore, it was effective to consider the radio signal strength as both an index of likelihood at the detection location and an index for the level of risk. We determined the location of wireless devices with high accuracy by filtering the detection results on the basis of radio signal strength and detection history. Results of this study showed that it would be effective to use the developed location database containing radio signal strength and detection history for security management of wireless LAN systems and more general-purpose location detection applications.",

Blockchain can also be utilized for administrative tasks, such as credentialing, claims adjudication, and billing management. It can also be utilized to enhance software supporting research and clinical trials. Blockchain complements artificial intelligence (AI) and these can work synergistically to create better solutions.

    "title": "Permissioned blockchain network for proactive access control to electronic health records.",
    "abstract": "As digital healthcare services handle increasingly more sensitive health data, robust access control methods are required. Especially in emergency conditions, where the patient's health situation is in peril, different healthcare providers associated with critical cases may need to be granted permission to acquire access to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of patients. The research objective of this work is to develop a proactive access control method that can grant emergency clinicians access to sensitive health data, guaranteeing the integrity and security of the data, and generating trust without the need for a trusted third party. A contextual and blockchain-based mechanism is proposed that allows access to sensitive EHRs by applying prognostic procedures where information based on context, is utilized to identify critical situations and grant access to medical data. Specifically, to enable proactivity, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks (NNs) are applied that utilize patient's recent health history to prognose the next two-hour health metrics values. Fuzzy logic is used to evaluate the severity of the patient's health state. These techniques are incorporated in a private and permissioned Hyperledger-Fabric blockchain network, capable of securing patient's sensitive information in the blockchain network. The developed access control method provides secure access for emergency clinicians to sensitive information and simultaneously safeguards the patient's well-being. Integrating this predictive mechanism within the blockchain network proved to be a robust tool to enhance the performance of the access control mechanism. Furthermore, the blockchain network of this work can record the history of who and when had access to a specific patient's sensitive EHRs, guaranteeing the integrity and security of the data, as well as recording the latency of this mechanism, where three different access control cases are evaluated. This access control mechanism is to be enforced in a real-life scenario in hospitals. The proposed mechanism informs proactively the emergency team of professional clinicians about patients' critical situations by combining fuzzy and predictive machine learning techniques incorporated in the private and permissioned blockchain network, and it exploits the distributed data of the blockchain architecture, guaranteeing the integrity and security of the data, and thus, enhancing the users' trust to the access control mechanism.",

Generally, log files contain the needed data to achieve this goal. This logged data can be recorded in several formats; we consider here IHE-ATNA (Integrating the healthcare enterprise-Audit Trail and Node Authentication) as log format. The difficulty lies in extracting useful information regardless of the log format. A posteriori access control frameworks often include a log filtering engine that provides this extraction function.

    "abstract": "In 2002, Ateniese and Medeiros proposed an e-prescription system, in which the patient can store e-prescription and related information using smart card. Latter, Yang et al. proposed a novel smart-card based e-prescription system based on Ateniese and Medeiros's system in 2004. Yang et al. considered the privacy issues of prescription data and adopted the concept of a group signature to provide patient's privacy protection. To make the e-prescription system more realistic, they further applied a proxy signature to allow a patient to delegate his signing capability to other people. This paper proposed a novel security and privacy preserving e-prescription system model based on smart cards. A new role, chemist, is included in the system model for settling the medicine dispute. We further presented a concrete identity-based (ID-based) group signature scheme and an ID-based proxy signature scheme to realize the proposed model. Main property of an ID-based system is that public key is simple user's identity and can be verified without extra public key certificates. Our ID-based group signature scheme can allow doctors to sign e-prescription anonymously. In a case of a medical dispute, identities of the doctors can be identified. The proposed ID-based proxy signature scheme can improve signing delegation and allows a delegation chain. The proposed e-prescription system based on our proposed two cryptographic schemes is more practical and efficient than Yang et al.'s system in terms of security, communication overheads, computational costs, practical considerations.",

    "abstract": "With the German Bundestag's adoption of the Data Protection Adaptation and Implementation Act EU (DSAnpUG-EU) on 30 June 2017, the adaptation of German law to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has begun (Gesetz zur Anpassung des Datenschutzrechts an die Verordnung (EU) 2016/679 und zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie (EU) 2016/680 (Datenschutz-Anpassungs- und -Umsetzungsgesetz-DSAnpUG-EU) v. 30. Juni 2017, BGBl. 2017 I p. 2097 et seq.). Despite being directly binding on all EU member states, the GDPR does not render national data protection provision obsolete-they are covered by the GDPR's opening clauses which include regulatory mandates and room for derogation. This creates considerable need for national legislative adaptation. Art. 1 DSAnpUG-EU contains the necessary amendments to the Federal Data Protection Law (BDSG(neu)), thus creating the second major building block of future German data protection alongside the GDPR itself. Nevertheless, there are still numerous sector-specific regulations in other federal laws and the data protection laws of the 16 states also need amendments. Adjustment in Germany is well on its way, but implementation in general is still ongoing, with further consequences for data processing and sharing.",

    "abstract": "A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an emerging technology that enables miniaturized analysis systems for point-of-care clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and environmental monitoring. A DMFB reduces the rate of sample and reagent consumption, and automates the analysis of assays. In this paper, we provide the first assessment of the security vulnerabilities of DMFBs. We identify result-manipulation attacks on a DMFB that maliciously alter the assay outcomes. Two practical result-manipulation attacks are shown on a DMFB platform performing enzymatic glucose assay on serum. In the first attack, the attacker adjusts the concentration of the glucose sample and thereby modifies the final result. In the second attack, the attacker tampers with the calibration curve of the assay operation. We then identify denial-of-service attacks, where the attacker can disrupt the assay operation by tampering either with the droplet-routing algorithm or with the actuation sequence. We demonstrate these attacks using a digital microfluidic synthesis simulator. The results show that the attacks are easy to implement and hard to detect. Therefore, this work highlights the need for effective protections against malicious modifications in DMFBs.",

This paper reviews existing approaches to assessing health app quality, identifying 18 studies that focus on both general and specialized evaluation frameworks, including tools like MARS (Mobile App Rating Score). The analysis highlights six key quality domains: technical features, user experience, general features, health information quality, ethical and legal conformity, and data security. Among these, 'user experience' and 'health information quality' were the most frequently cited criteria. While many frameworks share similar criteria, their evaluation methods differ. The findings stress the importance of establishing standards and fostering collaboration to ensure consistent quality assessment of health apps.",

    "title": "Blockchain Based Authentication and Cluster Head Selection Using DDR-LEACH in Internet of Sensor Things.",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a blockchain-based node authentication model for the Internet of sensor things (IoST). The nodes in the network are authenticated based on their credentials to make the network free from malicious nodes. In IoST, sensor nodes gather the information from the environment and send it to the cluster heads (CHs) for additional processing. CHs aggregate the sensed information. Therefore, their energy rapidly depletes due to extra workload. To solve this issue, we proposed distance, degree, and residual energy-based low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (DDR-LEACH) protocol. DDR-LEACH is used to replace CHs with the ordinary nodes based on maximum residual energy, degree, and minimum distance from BS. Furthermore, storing a huge amount of data in the blockchain is very costly. To tackle this issue, an external data storage, named as interplanetary file system (IPFS), is used. Furthermore, for ensuring data security in IPFS, AES 128-bit is used, which performs better than the existing encryption schemes. Moreover, a huge computational cost is required using a proof of work consensus mechanism to validate transactions. To solve this issue, proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used in the proposed model. The simulation results are carried out, which show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system model. The DDR-LEACH is compared with LEACH and the simulation results show that DDR-LEACH outperforms LEACH in terms of energy consumption, throughput, and improvement in network lifetime with CH selection mechanism. Moreover, transaction cost is computed, which is reduced by PoA during data storage on IPFS and service provisioning. Furthermore, the time is calculated in the comparison of AES 128-bit scheme with existing scheme. The formal security analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of smart contract against attacks. Additionally, two different attacks, MITM and Sybil, are induced in our system to show our system model's resilience against cyber attacks.",

BcT has been adopted in many sectors, including healthcare. However, there is no unified record format among hospitals for tracking patients' medical histories. In BcT, recorded data cannot be modified without affecting the chain hash code. The blockchain creates a secure and public digital ledger. BcT can also ensure accurate and timely financial transactions by automating payment processes among providers, insurers, and patients through smart contracts.

    "abstract": "With the advent of modern technologies, including the IoT and blockchain, smart-parking (SP) systems are becoming smarter and smarter. Similar to other automated systems, and particularly those that require automation or minimal interaction with humans, the SP system is heuristic in delivering performances, such as throughput in terms of latency, efficiency, privacy, and security, and it is considered a long-term cost-effective solution. This study looks ahead to future trends and developments in SP systems and presents an inclusive, long-term, effective, and well-performing smart autonomous vehicle parking (SAVP) system that explores and employs the emerging fog-computing and blockchain technologies as robust solutions to strengthen the existing collaborative IoT-cloud platform to build and manage SP systems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In other words, the proposed SAVP system offers a smart-parking solution, both indoors and outdoors, and mainly for AVs looking for vacant parking, wherein the fog nodes act as a middleware layer that provides various parking operations closer to IoT-enabled edge devices. To address the challenges of privacy and security, a lightweight integrated blockchain and cryptography (LIBC) module is deployed, which is functional at each fog node, to authorize and grant access to the AVs in every phase of parking (e.g., from the parking entrance to the parking slot to the parking exit). A proof-of-concept implementation was conducted, wherein the overall computed results, such as the average response time, efficiency, privacy, and security, were examined as highly efficient to enable a proven SAVP system. This study also examined an innovative pace, with careful considerations to combatting the existing SP-system challenges and, therefore, to building and managing future scalable SP systems.",

    "title": "Enabling ad-hoc reuse of private data repositories through schema extraction.",
    "abstract": "Sharing sensitive data across organizational boundaries is often significantly limited by legal and ethical restrictions. Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) impose strict requirements concerning the protection of personal and privacy sensitive data. Therefore new approaches, such as the Personal Health Train initiative, are emerging to utilize data right in their original repositories, circumventing the need to transfer data. Circumventing limitations of previous systems, this paper proposes a configurable and automated schema extraction and publishing approach, which enables ad-hoc SPARQL query formulation against RDF triple stores without requiring direct access to the private data. The approach is compatible with existing Semantic Web-based technologies and allows for the subsequent execution of such queries in a safe setting under the data provider's control. Evaluation with four distinct datasets shows that a configurable amount of concise and task-relevant schema, closely describing the structure of the underlying data, was derived, enabling the schema introspection-assisted authoring of SPARQL queries. Automatically extracting and publishing data schema can enable the introspection-assisted creation of data selection and integration queries. In conjunction with the presented system architecture, this approach can enable reuse of data from private repositories and in settings where agreeing upon a shared schema and encoding a priori is infeasible. As such, it could provide an important step towards reuse of data from previously inaccessible sources and thus towards the proliferation of data-driven methods in the biomedical domain.",

Recently, Ma and Lin proposed a generic method of designing a revocable IBE (RIBE) scheme that uses the complete subtree (CS) method by combining IBE and hierarchical IBE (HIBE) schemes. In this paper, we propose a new generic method for designing an RIBE scheme that uses the subset difference (SD) method instead of using the CS method. In order to use the SD method, we generically design an RIBE scheme by combining IBE, identity-based revocation (IBR), and two-level HIBE schemes. If the underlying IBE, IBR, and HIBE schemes are adaptively (or selectively) secure, then our RIBE scheme is also adaptively (or selectively) secure. In addition, we show that the layered SD (LSD) method can be applied to our RIBE scheme and a chosen-ciphertext secure RIBE scheme also can be designed generically.",

    "abstract": "Benefited from the development of network and communication technologies, E-health care systems and telemedicine have got the fast development. By using the E-health care systems, patient can enjoy the remote medical service provided by the medical server. Medical data are important privacy information for patient, so it is an important issue to ensure the secure of transmitted medical data through public network. Authentication scheme can thwart unauthorized users from accessing services via insecure network environments, so user authentication with privacy protection is an important mechanism for the security of E-health care systems. Recently, based on three factors (password, biometric and smart card), an user authentication scheme for E-health care systems was been proposed by Amin et al., and they claimed that their scheme can withstand most of common attacks. Unfortunate, we find that their scheme cannot achieve the untraceability feature of the patient. Besides, their scheme lacks a password check mechanism such that it is inefficient to find the unauthorized login by the mistake of input a wrong password. Due to the same reason, their scheme is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the patient updates the password mistakenly by using a wrong password. In order improve the security level of authentication scheme for E-health care application, a robust user authentication scheme with privacy protection is proposed for E-health care systems. Then, security prove of our scheme are analysed.

    "title": "Auto encoder-based defense mechanism against popular adversarial attacks in deep learning.",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models are prone to adversarial attacks, which present a significant hurdle to their reliability and robustness. The vulnerability of CNN-based models may be exploited by attackers to launch cyber-attacks. An attacker typically adds small, carefully crafted perturbations to original medical images. When a CNN-based model receives the perturbed medical image as input, it misclassifies the image, even though the added perturbation is often imperceptible to the human eye. The emergence of such attacks has raised security concerns regarding the implementation of deep learning-based medical image classification systems within clinical environments. To address this issue, a reliable defense mechanism is required to detect adversarial attacks on medical images. This study will focus on the robust detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images through CNN-based models. Various adversarial attacks and defense strategies will be evaluated and analyzed in the context of CNN-based pneumonia detection. From earlier studies, it has been observed that a single defense mechanism is usually not effective against more than one type of adversarial attack. Therefore, this study will propose a defense mechanism that is effective against multiple attack types. A reliable defense framework for pneumonia detection models will ensure secure clinical deployment, facilitating radiologists and doctors in their diagnosis and treatment planning. It can also save time and money by automating routine tasks. The proposed defense mechanism includes a convolutional autoencoder to denoise perturbed Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial images, two state- of-the-art attacks carried out at five magnitudes, i.e., ε (epsilon) values. Two pre-trained models, VGG19 and VGG16, and our hybrid model of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet169, called Stack Model, have been used to compare their results. This study shows that the proposed defense mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art studies. The PGD attack using the VGG16 model shows a better attack success rate by reducing overall accuracy by up to 67%. The autoencoder improves accuracy by up to 16% against PGD attacks in both the VGG16 and VGG19 models.",

    "abstract": "Services composition technology provides a flexible approach to building Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Service Applications (WSA) in a service oriented tasking system for WSN. Maintaining the data security of WSA is one of the most important goals in sensor network research. In this paper, we consider a WSN service oriented tasking system in which the WSN Services Broker (WSB), as the resource management center, can map the service request from user into a set of atom-services (AS) and send them to some independent sensor nodes (SN) for parallel execution. The distribution of ASs among these SNs affects the data security as well as the reliability and performance of WSA because these SNs can be of different and independent specifications. By the optimal service partition into the ASs and their distribution among SNs, the WSB can provide the maximum possible service reliability and/or expected performance subject to data security constraints. This paper proposes an algorithm of optimal service partition and distribution based on the universal generating function (UGF) and the genetic algorithm (GA) approach. The experimental analysis is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested algorithm.",

This paper aims to raise awareness about cybersecurity considerations for connected medical technology as they relate to informed consent discussions between patients and clinicians. Clinicians, health care cybersecurity researchers, and informed consent experts propose the concept of a cybersecurity informed consent for connected medical technology. This viewpoint discusses concepts designed to facilitate further discussion on the need, development, and execution of cybersecurity informed consent. Cybersecurity informed consent may be a necessary component of informed consent practices, as connected medical technology proliferates in the health care environment.",

Therefore, it may serve as promising cryptographic technique for cloud-assisted wireless sensor networks (CWSNs) to maintain data privacy. In this paper, an efficient RSA with equality test algorithm is proposed. The presented scheme also handles the attackers based on their authorization ability. Precisely, the proposed scheme is proved to be one-way against chosen-ciphertext attack security and indistinguishable against chosen ciphertext attacks. Moreover, the experimental evaluations depict that the underlying scheme is efficient in terms of encryption, decryption, and equality testing. Thus, this scheme may be used as a practical solution in context of CWSNs, where the users may compare two ciphertexts without decryption.",

    "abstract": "Internet of medical things (IoMT) has made it possible to collect applications and medical devices to improve healthcare information technology. Since the advent of the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, public health information has become more sensitive than ever. Moreover, different news items incorporated have resulted in differing public perceptions of COVID-19, especially on the social media platform and infrastructure. In addition, the unprecedented virality and changing nature of COVID-19 makes call centres to be likely overstressed, which is due to a lack of authentic and unregulated public media information. Furthermore, the lack of data privacy has restricted the sharing of COVID-19 information among health institutions. To resolve the above-mentioned limitations, this paper is proposing a privacy infrastructure based on federated learning and blockchain. The proposed infrastructure has the potentials to enhance the trust and authenticity of public media to disseminate COVID-19 information. Also, the proposed infrastructure can effectively provide a shared model while preserving the privacy of data owners. Furthermore, information security and privacy analyses show that the proposed infrastructure is robust against information security-related attacks.",

    "abstract": "Despite of various benefits such as a convenience and efficiency, home healthcare systems have some inherent security risks that may cause a serious leak on personal health information. This work presents a Secure User Profiling Structure which has the patient information including their health information. A patient and a hospital keep it at that same time, they share the updated data. While they share the data and communicate, the data can be leaked. To solve the security problems, a secure communication channel with a hash function and an One-Time Password between a client and a hospital should be established and to generate an input value to an OTP, it uses a dual hash-function. This work presents a dual hash function-based approach to generate the One-Time Password ensuring a secure communication channel with the secured key. In result, attackers are unable to decrypt the leaked information because of the secured key; in addition, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of computation cost.",

    "abstract": "The new European legislation on data protection, namely, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has introduced comprehensive requirements for the documentation about the processing of personal data as well as informing the data subjects of its use. GDPR's accountability principle requires institutions, projects, and data hubs to document their data processings and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. In response to this requirement, we see the emergence of commercial data-mapping tools, and institutions creating GDPR data register with such tools. One shortcoming of this approach is the genericity of tools, and their process-based model not capturing the project-based, collaborative nature of data processing in biomedical research. We have developed a software tool to allow research institutions to comply with the GDPR accountability requirement and map the sometimes very complex data flows in biomedical research. By analysing the transparency and record-keeping obligations of each GDPR principle, we observe that our tool effectively meets the accountability requirement. The GDPR is bringing data protection to center stage in research data management, necessitating dedicated tools, personnel, and processes. Our tool, DAISY, is tailored specifically for biomedical research and can help institutions in tackling the documentation challenge brought about by the GDPR. DAISY is made available as a free and open source tool on Github. DAISY is actively being used at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine and the ELIXIR-Luxembourg data hub.",

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based systems have become an important part of industry consortium systems because of their rapid growth and wide-ranging application. Various physical objects that are interconnected in the IIoT network communicate with each other and simplify the process of decision-making by observing and analyzing the surrounding environment. While making such intelligent decisions, devices need to transfer and communicate data with each other. However, as devices involved in IIoT networks grow and the methods of connections diversify, the traditional security frameworks face many shortcomings, including vulnerabilities to attack, lags in data, sharing data, and lack of proper authentication. Blockchain technology has the potential to empower safe data distribution of big data generated by the IIoT. Prevailing data-sharing methods in blockchain only concentrate on the data interchanging among parties, not on the efficiency in sharing, and storing. Hence an element-based K-harmonic means clustering algorithm (CA) is proposed for the effective sharing of data among the entities along with an algorithm named underweight data block (UDB) for overcoming the obstacle of storage space. The performance metrics considered for the evaluation of the proposed framework are the sum of squared error (SSE), time complexity with respect to different m values, and storage complexity with CPU utilization. The results have experimented with MATLAB 2018a simulation environment. The proposed model has better sharing, and storing based on blockchain technology, which is appropriate IIoT.",

    "abstract": "The health system in today's real world is significant but difficult and overcrowded. These hurdles can be diminished using improved health record management and blockchain technology. These technologies can handle medical data to provide security by monitoring and maintaining patient records. The processing of medical data and patient records is essential to analyze the earlier prescribed medicines and to understand the severity of diseases. Blockchain technology can improve the security, performance, and transparency of sharing the medical records of the current healthcare system. This paper proposed a novel framework for personal health record (PHR) management using IBM cloud data lake and blockchain platform for an effective healthcare management process. The problem in the blockchain-based healthcare management system can be minimized with the utilization of the proposed technique. Significantly, the traditional blockchain system usually decreases the latency. Therefore, the proposed technique focuses on improving latency and throughput. The result of the proposed system is calculated based on various matrices, such as F1 Score, Recall, and Confusion matrices. Therefore, the proposed work scored high accuracy and provided better results than existing techniques.",

Building on existing works in integrated distributed localization and specified-time formation maneuver, the proposed approach introduces a hierarchical topology framework based on (d+1)-reachability theory to achieve downward decoupling, ensuring that each robot in a given layer remains unaffected by attacks on lower-layer robots. The framework enhances resilience by restricting the flow of follower information to the current and previous layers and the leader, thereby improving distributed relative localization accuracy. An offline radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to mitigate unknown nonlinearities and FDI attacks, enabling the control protocol to achieve specified time convergence while reducing system errors compared to traditional finite-time and fixed-time methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the method with enhanced robustness and reduced error under adversarial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Medical supply chain communication networks engender critical information and data. Notably in the COVID era, inner personal and private information is being shared between healthcare providers regarding the medical supply chain. In recent years, multiple cyber-attacks have targeted medical supply chain communication networks due to their lack of security measures. In the era where cyber-attacks are cheaper and easier due to the computational power and various algorithms available for malicious uses, security, and data privacy requires intensive and higher measures. On the other hand, Information Hiding Techniques (IHT) compromise various advanced methods to hide sensitive information from being disclosed to malicious nodes. Moreover, with the support of Blockchain, IHT can bring higher security and the required privacy levels. In this paper, we propose the implementation of Blockchain and smart contract with the information hiding technique to enhance the security and privacy of data communication in critical systems, such as smart healthcare supply chain communication networks. Results show the feasibility of the framework using Hyperledger smart contract along with the desired security level.",

Blockchain technology, a peer-to-peer distributed database without centralized authority, initially applied to Bitcoin protocol, soon gained popularity, thanks to its distributed immutable nature in several non-medical fields. Therefore, the aim of the present review (PROSPERO N° CRD42022316661) is to establish a putative future role of blockchain and distribution ledger technology (DLT) in the organ transplantation field and its role to overcome inequalities. Preoperative assessment of the deceased donor, supranational crossover programs with the international waitlist databases, and reduction of black-market donations and counterfeit drugs are some of the possible applications of DLT, thanks to its distributed, efficient, secure, trackable, and immutable nature to reduce inequalities and discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Giri et al.'s proposed a RSA cryptosystem based remote user authentication scheme for telecare medical information system and claimed that the protocol is secure against all the relevant security attacks. However, we have scrutinized the Giri et al.'s protocol and pointed out that the protocol is not secure against off-line password guessing attack, privileged insider attack and also suffers from anonymity problem. Moreover, the extension of password guessing attack leads to more security weaknesses. Therefore, this protocol needs improvement in terms of security before implementing in real-life application. To fix the mentioned security pitfalls, this paper proposes an improved scheme over Giri et al.'s scheme, which preserves user anonymity property. We have then simulated the proposed protocol using widely-accepted AVISPA tool which ensures that the protocol is SAFE under OFMC and CL-AtSe models, that means the same protocol is secure against active and passive attacks including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal cryptanalysis has been also presented, which confirmed that the proposed protocol provides well security protection on the relevant security attacks. The performance analysis section compares the proposed protocol with other existing protocols in terms of security and it has been observed that the protocol provides more security and achieves additional functionalities such as user anonymity and session key verification.",

Traditionally, the failure probabilities of bottom events of an Internet security system are treated as exact values when the failure probability of the entire system is estimated. However, security threat assessment when the malfunction data of the system's elementary event are incomplete--the traditional approach for calculating reliability--is no longer applicable. Moreover, it does not consider the failure probability of the bottom events suffered in the attack, which may bias conclusions. In order to effectively solve the problem above, this paper proposes a novel technique, integrating attack tree and vague sets for security threat assessment. For verification of the proposed approach, a numerical example of an Internet security system security threat assessment is adopted in this paper. The result of the proposed method is compared with the listing approaches of security threat assessment methods.",

However, we show that Bin Muhaya's scheme is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attacks and does not provide perfect forward secrecy. Furthermore, in order to overcome the mentioned weaknesses, we propose a new two-factor anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme using the elliptic curve cryptosystem.

This paper discusses an alliance blockchain (i.e., a private blockchain) model for governance innovation in internet hospitals with an improved encryption methodology. We compare our proposed model, improved Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption, integrated into the blockchain framework. Improved RSA achieves impressive improvements in all key metrics by increasing the throughput by 24.7% and lowering the latency by 19.8% compared to the base model. Thus, the improved model is more optimized for processing transactions related to healthcare data. Memory usage was also reduced by 14.3%. While encryption time remained pretty close, the decryption time remarkably improved by 97.5%. IoT sensors are one of the foundations for Internet hospitals that produce consistent patient data streams, such as physiological and environmental metrics. The proposed alliance blockchain model enables the secure and efficient real-time management of this sensor data. These results demonstrate the capability of alliance blockchain and cryptographic upgrades in creating safe and efficient governance frameworks for Internet hospitals.",

    "abstract": "In the era of digital healthcare, biomedical data sharing is of paramount importance for the advancement of research and personalised healthcare. However, sharing such data while preserving user privacy and ensuring data security poses significant challenges. This paper introduces BioChainReward (BCR), a blockchain-based framework designed to address these concerns. BCR offers enhanced security, privacy, and incentivisation for data sharing in biomedical applications. Its architecture consists of four distinct layers: data, blockchain, smart contract, and application. The data layer handles the encryption and decryption of data, while the blockchain layer manages data hashing and retrieval. The smart contract layer includes an AI-enabled privacy-preservation sublayer that dynamically selects an appropriate privacy technique, tailored to the nature and purpose of each data request. This layer also features a feedback and incentive mechanism that incentivises patients to share their data by offering rewards. Lastly, the application layer serves as an interface for diverse applications, such as AI-enabled apps and data analysis tools, to access and utilise the shared data. Hence, BCR presents a robust, comprehensive approach to secure, privacy-aware, and incentivised data sharing in the biomedical domain.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) brought innovation along with unprecedented benefits of convenience and efficacy in many operations that were otherwise very cumbersome. This innovation explosion has surfaced a new dimension of vulnerability and physical threat to the data integrity of IoT networks. Implementing conventional cryptographic algorithms on IoT devices is not future-proof as these devices are constrained in terms of computational power, performance, and memory. In this paper, we are proposing a novel framework, a unique model that integrates IoT networks with a blockchain to address potential privacy and security threats for data integrity. Smart contracts are instrumental in this integration process and they are used to handle device authentication, authorization and access-control, and data management. We further share a new design model for interfaces to integrate both platforms while highlighting its performance results over the existing models. With the incorporation of off-chain data storage into the framework, overall scalability of the system can be increased. Finally, our research concludes how the proposed framework can be fused virtually into any existing IoT applications with minimal modifications.",

    "abstract": "Security has always been the main concern for the internet of things (IoT)-based systems. Blockchain, with its decentralized and distributed design, prevents the risks of the existing centralized methodologies. Conventional security and privacy architectures are inapplicable in the spectrum of IoT due to its resource constraints. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a Blockchain-based security mechanism that enables secure authorized access to smart city resources. The presented mechanism comprises the ACE (Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments) framework-based authorization Blockchain and the OSCAR (Object Security Architecture for the Internet of Things) object security model. The Blockchain lays out a flexible and trustless authorization mechanism, while OSCAR makes use of a public ledger to structure multicast groups for authorized clients. Moreover, a meteor-based application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for heterogeneous technologies belonging to the smart city. The users would be able to interact with and control their smart city resources such as traffic lights, smart electric meters, surveillance cameras, etc., through this application. To evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed mechanism, the authorization Blockchain is implemented on top of the Ethereum network. The authentication mechanism is developed in the node.js server and a smart city is simulated with the help of Raspberry Pi B+. Furthermore, mocha and chai frameworks are used to assess the performance of the system. Experimental results reveal that the authentication response time is less than 100 ms even if the average hand-shaking time increases with the number of clients.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the limited resources available in IoT local devices, the large scale cloud consumer's data that are produced by IoT related machines are contracted out to the cloud. Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud-data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large-data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real-time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time.",

Within the health care domain, blockchain technology has been actively explored as a tool for improving personal health data management, medical device security, and clinical trial management. Despite a strong demand for innovation and cutting-edge technology in plastic surgery, integration of blockchain technologies within plastic surgery is in its infancy. Recent advances and mainstream adoption of blockchain are gaining momentum and have shown significant promise for improving patient care and information management. In this article, the authors explain what defines a blockchain and discuss its history and potential applications in plastic surgery. Existing evidence suggests that blockchain can enable patient-centered data management, improve privacy, and provide additional safeguards against human error. Integration of blockchain technology into clinical practice requires further research and development to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for patients and providers.",

    "abstract": "Due to the development of information technologies and network technologies, healthcare systems have been employed in many countries. As an important part of healthcare systems, the wireless body area network (WBAN) could bring convenience to both patients and physicians because it could help physicians to monitor patients' physiological values remotely. It is essential to ensure secure communication in WBANs because patients' physiological values are very sensitive. Recently, Liu et al. proposed an efficient authentication scheme for WBANs. Unfortunately, Zhao pointed out that their scheme suffered from the stolen verifier-table attack. To improve security and efficiency, Zhao proposed an anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs. However, Zhao's scheme cannot provide real anonymity because the users' pseudo identities are constant value and the attack could tract the users. In this paper, we propose a new anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme could overcome weaknesses in previous scheme. We also use the BAN logic to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme.",

    "title": "Cloud bursting galaxy: federated identity and access management.",
    "abstract": "Large biomedical datasets, such as those from genomics and imaging, are increasingly being stored on commercial and institutional cloud computing platforms. This is because cloud-scale computing resources, from robust backup to high-speed data transfer to scalable compute and storage, are needed to make these large datasets usable. However, one challenge for large-scale biomedical data on the cloud is providing secure access, especially when datasets are distributed across platforms. While there are open Web protocols for secure authentication and authorization, these protocols are not in wide use in bioinformatics and are difficult to use for even technologically sophisticated users. We have developed a generic and extensible approach for securely accessing biomedical datasets distributed across cloud computing platforms. Our approach combines OpenID Connect and OAuth2, best-practice Web protocols for authentication and authorization, together with Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org), a web-based computational workbench used by thousands of scientists across the world. With our enhanced version of Galaxy, users can access and analyze data distributed across multiple cloud computing providers without any special knowledge of access/authorization protocols. Our approach does not require users to share permanent credentials (e.g. username, password, API key), instead relying on automatically generated temporary tokens that refresh as needed. Our approach is generalizable to most identity providers and cloud computing platforms. To the best of our knowledge, Galaxy is the only computational workbench where users can access biomedical datasets across multiple cloud computing platforms using best-practice Web security approaches and thereby minimize risks of unauthorized data access and credential use.

Here, we report on a user-centered design study that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to investigate several dimensions relevant to PHR design, and to look at the effect of health status on user needs. The results indicate that health status, especially disability and chronic illness, is relevant to PHR design. Further, the results provide empirical evidence about the role of privacy and security in users' attitudes toward PHR use. The exact nature of these attitudes differs from widely held perceptions about consumer values in healthcare information management.",

    "abstract": "The usage of digital and intelligent healthcare applications on mobile devices has grown progressively. These applications are generally distributed and access remote healthcare services on the user's applications from different hospital sources. These applications are designed based on client-server architecture and different paradigms such as socket, remote procedure call, and remote method invocation (RMI). However, these existing paradigms do not offer a security mechanism for healthcare applications in distributed mobile-fog-cloud networks. This paper devises a blockchain-socket-RMI-based framework for fine-grained healthcare applications in the mobile-fog-cloud network. This study introduces a new open healthcare framework for applied research purposes and has blockchain-socket-RMI abstraction level classes for healthcare applications. The goal is to meet the security and deadline requirements of fine-grained healthcare tasks and minimize execution and data validation costs during processing applications in the system. This study introduces a partial proof of validation (PPoV) scheme that converts the workload into the hash and validates it among mobile, fog, and cloud nodes during offloading, execution, and storing data in the secure form. Simulation discussions illustrate that the proposed blockchain-socket-RMI minimizes the processing and blockchain costs and meets the security and deadline requirements of fine-grained healthcare tasks of applications as compared to existing frameworks in work.",

The SE scheme proposed by Cash et al. in Crypto2013 and its follow-up work in CCS2013 are most practical SE Scheme that support Boolean queries at present. In their scheme, the data user has to generate the search tokens by the counter number one by one and interact with server repeatedly, until he meets the correct one, or goes through plenty of tokens to illustrate that there is no search result. In this paper, we make an improvement to their scheme. We allow server to send back some information and help the user to generate exact search token in the search phase. In our scheme, there are only two round interaction between server and user, and the search token has [Formula: see text] elements, where n is the keywords number in query expression, and [Formula: see text] is the minimum documents number that contains one of keyword in query expression, and the computation cost of server is [Formula: see text] modular exponentiation operation.",

    "title": "Cyber Hygiene Methodology for Raising Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Awareness in Health Care Organizations: Concept Study.",
    "abstract": "Cyber threats are increasing across all business sectors, with health care being a prominent domain. In response to the ever-increasing threats, health care organizations (HOs) are enhancing the technical measures with the use of cybersecurity controls and other advanced solutions for further protection. Despite the need for technical controls, humans are evidently the weakest link in the cybersecurity posture of HOs. This suggests that addressing the human aspects of cybersecurity is a key step toward managing cyber-physical risks. In practice, HOs are required to apply general cybersecurity and data privacy guidelines that focus on human factors. However, there is limited literature on the methodologies and procedures that can assist in successfully mapping these guidelines to specific controls (interventions), including awareness activities and training programs, with a measurable impact on personnel. To this end, tools and structured methodologies for assisting higher management in selecting the minimum number of required controls that will be most effective on the health care workforce are highly desirable. This study aimed to introduce a cyber hygiene (CH) methodology that uses a unique survey-based risk assessment approach for raising the cybersecurity and data privacy awareness of different employee groups in HOs. The main objective was to identify the most effective strategy for managing cybersecurity and data privacy risks and recommend targeted human-centric controls that are tailored to organization-specific needs. The CH methodology relied on a cross-sectional, exploratory survey study followed by a proposed risk-based survey data analysis approach. First, survey data were collected from 4 different employee groups across 3 European HOs, covering 7 categories of cybersecurity and data privacy risks. Next, survey data were transcribed and fitted into a proposed risk-based approach matrix that translated risk levels to strategies for managing the risks. A list of human-centric controls and implementation levels was created. These controls were associated with risk categories, mapped to risk strategies for managing the risks related to all employee groups. Our mapping empowered the computation and subsequent recommendation of subsets of human-centric controls to implement the identified strategy for managing the overall risk of the HOs. An indicative example demonstrated the application of the CH methodology in a simple scenario. Finally, by applying the CH methodology in the health care sector, we obtained results in the form of risk markings; identified strategies to manage the risks; and recommended controls for each of the 3 HOs, each employee group, and each risk category. The proposed CH methodology improves the CH perception and behavior of personnel in the health care sector and provides risk strategies together with a list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to health care employees.",

Hence, the control of access to remote medical servers' resources has become a crucial challenge. A secure authentication scheme between the medical server and remote users is therefore needed to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality and to ensure availability. Recently, many authentication schemes that use low-cost mobile devices have been proposed to meet these requirements. In contrast to previous schemes, Khan et al. proposed a dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme that reduces computational complexity and includes features such as a provision for the revocation of lost or stolen smart cards and a time expiry check for the authentication process. However, Khan et al.'s scheme has some security drawbacks. To remedy theses, this study proposes an enhanced authentication scheme that overcomes the weaknesses inherent in Khan et al.'s scheme and demonstrated this scheme is more secure and robust for use in a telecare medical information system.",

To thoroughly investigate all aspects of the subject, we analyzed primary studies based on research questions (RQs) and developed a unified conceptual model using step-based model creation. Studies from 2015 to 2023 were reviewed, and 34 primary studies were comprehensively analyzed by using the PICO template. In our findings, privacy emerged as the most frequently cited requirement in clinical research. The most mentioned use cases for blockchain are ensuring data immutability and security. A significant issue identified beyond the common blockchain limitations of capacity and scalability is the lack of standards for compliance with legal frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA. After all these efforts, we developed a conceptual model, which, to our best knowledge, is the first in the literature to support software developers and clinical researchers in developing and using blockchain-based research platforms efficiently.",

Neglecting to safeguard data confidentially and integrity and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access will lead to failures in materializing benefit from digital health. This study aims to present a bibliometric analysis of health data privacy and provide a platform for future directions. We conducted a literature search between 2010 and 2020 in the Web of Science (WoS) database, resulted in 1,752 records. As part of the bibliometric analysis, concept mapping of health data privacy researches was depicted by network visualization and overlay visualization. These two visualizations represent five research fronts and emerging topics (e.g., digital health, blockchain, the internet of things (IoT)). Finally, we chart directions for future research on health data privacy, highlighting emerging topics, and boundary-breaking alternatives (e.g., GDPR, contact tracing apps in the context of pandemics).",

    "abstract": "Sensor networks have opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems, which can transmit patient's condition to health professional's hand-held devices in time. The patient's physiological signals are very sensitive and the networks are extremely vulnerable to many attacks. It must be ensured that patient's privacy is not exposed to unauthorized entities. Therefore, the control of access to healthcare systems has become a crucial challenge. An efficient and secure authentication protocol will thus be needed in wireless medical sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a certificateless authentication scheme without bilinear pairing while providing patient anonymity. Compared with other related protocols, the proposed scheme needs less computation and communication cost and preserves stronger security. Our performance evaluations show that this protocol is more practical for healthcare system in wireless medical sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Ever since health-care information systems have been implemented, their security is being considered an important issue, especially in the light of the fact that their data are deemed to comprise extremely sensitive information. The prospect of storing health information in electronic form raises concerns about patient privacy and data security. Any attempt to introduce computerised health-care information systems should, therefore, guarantee adequate protection of the confidentiality and integrity of patient information. At the same time, the patient information also needs to be readily available to all authorised health-care providers, in order to ensure the proper treatment of the patient. The principal aim of the present paper is, however, not to make a new contribution to the subject of security per se, but rather to give an overview of current trends in the security aspects of health-care information systems. The final section of the paper will be devoted to a number of proposals for further research possibilities in the domain of health-care information systems security.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research is becoming increasingly large-scale and international. Cloud computing enables the comprehensive integration of genomic and clinical data, and the global sharing and collaborative processing of these data within a flexibly scalable infrastructure. Clouds offer novel research opportunities in genomics, as they facilitate cohort studies to be carried out at unprecedented scale, and they enable computer processing with superior pace and throughput, allowing researchers to address questions that could not be addressed by studies using limited cohorts. A well-developed example of such research is the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project, which involves the analysis of petabyte-scale genomic datasets from research centers in different locations or countries and different jurisdictions. Aside from the tremendous opportunities, there are also concerns regarding the utilization of clouds; these concerns pertain to perceived limitations in data security and protection, and the need for due consideration of the rights of patient donors and research participants. Furthermore, the increased outsourcing of information technology impedes the ability of researchers to act within the realm of existing local regulations owing to fundamental differences in the understanding of the right to data protection in various legal systems. In this Opinion article, we address the current opportunities and limitations of cloud computing and highlight the responsible use of federated and hybrid clouds that are set up between public and private partners as an adequate solution for genetics and genomics research in Europe, and under certain conditions between Europe and international partners. This approach could represent a sensible middle ground between fragmented individual solutions and a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.",

This paper presents an architecture to ensure the privacy of health-related data, which are stored and shared within a blockchain network in a decentralized manner, through the use of encryption with the RSA, ECC, and AES algorithms. Evaluation tests were performed to verify the impact of cryptography on the proposed architecture in terms of computational effort, memory usage, and execution time. The results demonstrate an impact mainly on the execution time and on the increase in the computational effort for sending data to the blockchain, which is justifiable considering the privacy and security provided with the architecture and encryption.",

There is an increasing number of healthcare professionals and patients using medical wearables for diagnosis and treatment, which simplifies and improves the diagnostic and therapeutic process. However, inappropriate use of medical data may result in the disclosure of private patient information. For protecting patients' privacy when using medical wearables, we propose a new blockchain-based data access security scheme. Specifically, the elliptic curve encryption algorithm and zero-knowledge authentication method are used to authenticate the identity of patients and doctors in the blockchain network. Furthermore, we develop a smart recommendation method based on deep reinforcement learning to recommend appropriate doctors for patients. Next, patients allow recommended doctors to access their medical data, and smart contracts specifically designed for secure data access to medical wearables will regulate subsequent data access. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively protect patients' privacy during treatment through secure authentication and data access for medical wearables.",

We propose a blockchain for cross-border healthcare to store the evidence of different electronic, physical identities, and identifiers, but also the rules approved by the patient or legal guardians to access patient data. The International Patient Summary (IPS) is the de facto standard for cross-border healthcare and includes an index of information classified into sections (HL7 FHIR Composition) that healthcare professionals and services can update and read on the patient's SOS service, then retrieving all the necessary patient information from the different FHIR API endpoints of different healthcare providers according to the approved rules.",

However, in this paper, we show that his scheme have some security flaws. Then, we shall propose a secure authentication scheme to overcome their weaknesses. We prove the proposed scheme with random oracle and also use the BAN logic to prove the correctness of the proposed scheme.

It helps to protect the data from unauthorized access by attackers. However, all the existing advanced technologies face some issues because of their uncertainties. These technologies have some lapses to provide privacy, attack-free, transparency, reliability, and flexibility. These characteristics are essential while managing any sensitive data like educational certificates or medical certificates. Hence, we designed an Industry 5.0 based blockchain application to manage medical certificates using Remix Ethereum blockchain in this paper. This application also employs a distributed application (DApp) that uses a test RPC-based Ethereum blockchain and user expert system as a knowledge agent. The main strength of this work is the maintenance of existing certificates over a blockchain with the creation of new certificates that use logistic Map encryption cipher on existing medical certificates while uploading into the blockchain. This application helps to quickly analyze the birth, death, and sick rate as per certain features like location and year.",

    "abstract": "In order for wireless body area networks to meet widespread adoption, a number of security implications must be explored to promote and maintain fundamental medical ethical principles and social expectations. As a result, integration of security functionality to sensor nodes is required. Integrating security functionality to a wireless sensor node increases the size of the stored software program in program memory, the required time that the sensor's microprocessor needs to process the data and the wireless network traffic which is exchanged among sensors. This security overhead has dominant impact on the energy dissipation which is strongly related to the lifetime of the sensor, a critical aspect in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. Strict definition of the security functionality, complete hardware model (microprocessor and radio), WBAN topology and the structure of the medium access control (MAC) frame are required for an accurate estimation of the energy that security introduces into the WBAN. In this work, we define a lightweight security scheme for WBAN, we estimate the additional energy consumption that the security scheme introduces to WBAN based on commercial available off-the-shelf hardware components (microprocessor and radio), the network topology and the MAC frame. Furthermore, we propose a new microcontroller design in order to reduce the energy consumption of the system. Experimental results and comparisons with other works are given.",

In medical system, sensors on or in patients produce medical data which can be easily compromised by a vast of attacks. Although signature schemes can protect data authenticity and data integrity, when the number of users involved in the medical system becomes huge, the bandwidth and storage cost will rise sharply so that existing signature schemes are inapplicability for WSNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient aggregate signature scheme for healthcare WSNs according to an improved security model, which can combine multiple signatures into a single aggregate signature. The length of such an aggregate signature may be as long as that of an individual one, which can greatly decrease the bandwidth and storage cost for networks.",

    "title": "Pseudonymization for research data collection: is the juice worth the squeeze?",
    "abstract": "The collection of data and biospecimens which characterize patients and probands in-depth is a core element of modern biomedical research. Relevant data must be considered highly sensitive and it needs to be protected from unauthorized use and re-identification. In this context, laws, regulations, guidelines and best-practices often recommend or mandate pseudonymization, which means that directly identifying data of subjects (e.g. names and addresses) is stored separately from data which is primarily needed for scientific analyses. When (authorized) re-identification of subjects is not an exceptional but a common procedure, e.g. due to longitudinal data collection, implementing pseudonymization can significantly increase the complexity of software solutions. For example, data stored in distributed databases, need to be dynamically combined with each other, which requires additional interfaces for communicating between the various subsystems. This increased complexity may lead to new attack vectors for intruders. Obviously, this is in contrast to the objective of improving data protection. What is lacking is a standardized process of evaluating and reporting risks, threats and countermeasures, which can be used to test whether integrating pseudonymization methods into data collection systems actually improves upon the degree of protection provided by system designs that simply follow common IT security best practices and implement fine-grained role-based access control models. To demonstrate that the methods used to describe systems employing pseudonymized data management are currently heterogeneous and ad-hoc, we examined the extent to which twelve recent studies address each of the six basic security properties defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 27,000. We show inconsistencies across the studies, with most of them failing to mention one or more security properties. We discuss the degree of privacy protection provided by implementing pseudonymization into research data collection processes. We conclude that (1) more research is needed on the interplay of pseudonymity, information security and data protection, (2) problem-specific guidelines for evaluating and reporting risks, threats and countermeasures should be developed and that (3) future work on pseudonymized research data collection should include the results of such structured and integrated analyses.",

    "title": "A Secure Blockchain-Based Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for 3GPP 5G Networks.",
    "abstract": "The futuristic fifth-generation cellular network (5G) not only supports high-speed internet, but must also connect a multitude of devices simultaneously without compromising network security. To ensure the security of the network, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has standardized the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol for mutually authenticating user equipment (UE), base stations, and the core network. However, it has been found that 5G-AKA is vulnerable to many attacks, including linkability attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. To address these security issues and improve the robustness of the 5G network, in this paper, we introduce the Secure Blockchain-based Authentication and Key Agreement for 5G Networks (5GSBA). Using blockchain as a distributed database, our 5GSBA decentralizes authentication functions from a centralized server to all base stations. It can prevent single-point-of-failure and increase the difficulty of DDoS attacks. Moreover, to ensure the data in the blockchain cannot be used for device impersonation, our scheme employs the one-time secret hash function as the device secret key. Furthermore, our 5GSBA can protect device anonymity by mandating the encryption of device identities with Subscription Concealed Identifiers (SUCI). Linkability attacks are also prevented by deprecating the sequence number with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). We use Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the Scyther tool to formally verify our protocol. The security analysis shows that 5GSBA is superior to 5G-AKA in terms of perfect forward secrecy, device anonymity, and mutual Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA). Additionally, it effectively deters linkability attacks, replay attacks, and most importantly, DoS and DDoS attacks. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that 5GSBA is efficient for both UEs and base stations with reasonably low computational costs and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Cyber physical system (CPS) is a network of cyber and physical elements, which interact with one another in a feedback form. CPS approves critical infrastructure and is treated as essential in day to day since it forms the basis of futuristic smart devices. An increased usage of CPSs poses security as a challenging issue and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be applied for the identification of network intrusions. The latest advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) enables to design effective IDS models for the CPS environment. At the same time, metaheuristic algorithms can be employed as a feature selection approach in order to reduce the curse of dimensionality. With this motivation, this study develops a novel Poor and Rich Optimization with Deep Learning Model for Blockchain Enabled Intrusion Detection in CPS Environment, called PRO-DLBIDCPS technique. The proposed PRO-DLBIDCPS technique initially introduces an Adaptive Harmony Search Algorithm (AHSA) based feature selection technique for proper selection of feature subsets. For intrusion detection and classification, and attention based bi-directional gated recurrent neural network (ABi-GRNN) model is applied. In addition, the detection efficiency of the ABi-GRNN technique has been enhanced by the use of Poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm based hyperparameter optimizer, which resulted in enhanced intrusion detection results. Furthermore, blockchain technology is applied for enhancing security in the CPS environment. In order to demonstrate the enhanced outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique, a wide range of simulations was carried out on benchmark dataset and the results reported the better outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique in terms of several measures.",

However, previous studies showed that organizations had not effectively learned lessons from security incidents. Incident learning as an essential activity in the \"follow-up\" phase of security incident response lifecycle has long been addressed but not given enough attention. This paper conducted a case study in a healthcare organization in China to explore their current obstacles in the practice of incident learning. We interviewed both IT professionals and healthcare professionals. The results showed that the organization did not have a structured way to gather and redistribute incident knowledge. Incident response was ineffective in cycling incident knowledge back to inform security management. Incident reporting to multiple stakeholders faced a great challenge. In response to this case study, we suggest the security assurance modeling framework to address those obstacles.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread and increasing use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in all aspects of daily life, a hopeful future for people, data, and processes is emerging. Extensive spans allow for an integrated life cycle to be created from home to enterprise. The Internet of Medical things (IoMT) forms a flourishing surface that incorporates the sensitive information of human life being sent to doctors or hospitals. These open an enormous space for hackers to utilize flaws of the IoMT network to make a profit. This creates a demand for standardizing regulations and a secure system. Though many authorities are making standards, there are some lacking in the system which makes the product vulnerable. Although many established mechanisms are present for the IoT network, there are a number of obstacles preventing its general implementation in the IoMT network. One of the adoption challenges is the IoMT devices itself, because many IoMT networks consist of battery-powered devices with constrained processing capability. A general overview of the different security integrations with IoT applications has been presented in several papers. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an overview of the IoMT ecosystem, regulations, challenges of standards, security mechanisms using cryptographic solutions, physical unclonable functions (PUF)-based solutions, blockchain, and named data networking (NDN) as well, with pros and cons.",

Recently, Amin and Biswas demonstrated that the authentication scheme proposed by Giri et al. is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attacks and privileged insider attacks and also does not provide user anonymity. They also proposed an improved authentication scheme, claiming that it resists various security attacks. However, this paper demonstrates that Amin and Biswas's scheme is defenseless against off-line password guessing attacks and replay attacks and also does not provide perfect forward secrecy. This paper also shows that Giri et al.'s scheme not only suffers from the weaknesses pointed out by Amin and Biswas, but it also is vulnerable to replay attacks and does not provide perfect forward secrecy. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme to overcome the mentioned weaknesses. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme not only overcomes the mentioned security weaknesses, but also is more efficient than the previous schemes.",

The study is compiled by reviewing research articles published in nine well-reputed venues such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springs Link, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, Science Direct, PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, and MDPI between January 2016 to August 2021. A total of 1,192 research studies were identified out of which 51 articles were selected based on inclusion criteria for this SLR that presents the modern information on the recent implications and gaps in the use of BCT for enhancing the healthcare procedures. According to the outcomes, BCT is being applied to design the novel and advanced interventions to enrich the current protocol of managing, distributing, and processing clinical records and personal medical information. BCT is enduring the conceptual development in the healthcare domain, where it has summed up the substantial elements through better and enhanced efficiency, technological innovation, access control, data privacy, and security. A framework is developed to address the probable field where future researchers can add considerable value, such as data protection, system architecture, and regulatory compliance. Finally, this SLR concludes that the upcoming research can support the pervasive implementation of BCT to address the critical dilemmas related to health diagnostics, enhancing the patient healthcare process in remote monitoring or emergencies, data integrity, and avoiding fraud.",

    "abstract": "Due to recent developments in technologies associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of people now regularly use smart devices, such as smartwatches and smartphones. However, these devices are prone to data leaks because of security vulnerabilities. In particular, Android devices use permission-based security, which allows users to directly approve permissions requested by an app when installing it. As a result, many malicious apps can obtain and leak private user data by requesting more permissions than are needed. However, it is difficult to identify malicious apps based solely on the requested permissions. A system is hence needed to accurately identify malicious apps and protect private data from them. In this paper, we propose a system for hiding data related to a user's contacts or providing virtual data according to preconfigured policies when an Android app requests access to them. By hiding data related to the contacts, the proposed system can protect them from malicious apps. By using virtual data, it can even detect malicious apps that leak private data. The system requires less storage and provides faster access to user contacts than prevalent solutions to similar problems.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity and critical care staff: A mixed methods study.",
    "abstract": "Cyberattacks on healthcare organisations are becoming increasingly common and represent a growing threat to patient safety. The majority of breaches in cybersecurity have been attributed to human error. Intensive care departments are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. The aim of this study was to investigate cybersecurity awareness, knowledge and behaviours among critical care staff. This was a multi-site cross-sectional survey study administered to critical care staff. Cybersecurity awareness was evaluated using the validated HAIS-Q instrument. Knowledge and behaviours were evaluated by direct questioning and scenario-based multiple-choice questions. Free text options were also offered to respondents. Thematic analysis was performed on free text sections. Median scores of 12-15 in each of the HAIS-Q focus areas were achieved, indicating high levels of cybersecurity awareness among critical care staff. However, self-reported confidence in cybersecurity practices, especially identifying signs of cybersecurity breaches and reporting cybersecurity incidents, were relatively low. Participants responses to the scenarios demonstrated a lack of knowledge and awareness of some of the mechanisms of cyberattacks. Barriers to safe cybersecurity practices among staff that emerged from the qualitative analysis included: a lack of training and education; heavy workloads and staff fatigue; perceived lack of IT support and poor IT infrastructure. Critical care staff appear to have a high-level cybersecurity awareness. However, in practice safe cybersecurity practices are not always followed. ICU departments and hospitals must invest in the human aspect of cybersecurity to strength their cyber-defences and to protect patients.",

    "title": "Security analysis of standards-driven communication protocols for healthcare scenarios.",
    "abstract": "The importance of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), that stores all healthcare-related data belonging to a patient, has been recognised in recent years by governments, institutions and industry. Initiatives like the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) have been developed for the definition of standard methodologies for secure and interoperable EHR exchanges among clinics and hospitals. Using the requisites specified by these initiatives, many large scale projects have been set up for enabling healthcare professionals to handle patients' EHRs. The success of applications developed in these contexts crucially depends on ensuring such security properties as confidentiality, authentication, and authorization. In this paper, we first propose a communication protocol, based on the IHE specifications, for authenticating healthcare professionals and assuring patients' safety. By means of a formal analysis carried out by using the specification language COWS and the model checker CMC, we reveal a security flaw in the protocol thus demonstrating that to simply adopt the international standards does not guarantee the absence of such type of flaws. We then propose how to emend the IHE specifications and modify the protocol accordingly. Finally, we show how to tailor our protocol for application to more critical scenarios with no assumptions on the communication channels. To demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of our protocols we have fully implemented them.",

    "abstract": "With the progress and the development of information technology, the internal data in medical organizations have become computerized and are further established the medical information system. Moreover, the use of the Internet enhances the information communication as well as affects the development of the medical information system that a lot of medical information is transmitted with the Internet. Since there is a network within another network, when all networks are connected together, they will form the \"Internet\". For this reason, the Internet is considered as a high-risk and public environment which is easily destroyed and invaded so that a relevant protection is acquired. Besides, the data in the medical network system are confidential that it is necessary to protect the personal privacy, such as electronic patient records, medical confidential information, and authorization-controlled data in the hospital. As a consequence, a medical network system is considered as a network requiring high security that excellent protections and managerial strategies are inevitable to prevent illegal events and external attacks from happening. This study proposes secure medical managerial strategies being applied to the network environment of the medical organization information system so as to avoid the external or internal information security events, allow the medical system to work smoothly and safely that not only benefits the patients, but also allows the doctors to use it more conveniently, and further promote the overall medical quality. The objectives could be achieved by preventing from illegal invasion or medical information being stolen, protecting the completeness and security of medical information, avoiding the managerial mistakes of the internal information system in medical organizations, and providing the highly-reliable medical information system.",

Authenticated key agreement protocol is very important for protecting the security in TMIS. Recently scholars have proposed a lot of authenticated key agreement protocols. In 2016, Chiou et al. demonstrated that Chen et al.'s authentication scheme fails to provide user's anonymity and message authentication and then proposed an enhanced scheme (Chiou et al., J. Med. Syst. 40(4):1-15, 2006) to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that Chiou et al.'s scheme is defenseless against key compromise impersonation (KCI) attack and also fails to provide forward security. Moreover, we propose a novel authentication scheme namely ICASME to overcome the mentioned weaknesses in this paper. Security analyses show that ICASME achieves the forward security and KCI attack resistance. In addition, it is proved that the time taken to implement the ICASME is not intolerable compared to the original protocol.",

    "abstract": "Current methods of detecting confidentiality breaches in electronic medical record systems are inadequate, partially due to the lack of necessary information at the point of audit trail analysis. In order to determine the information requirements for effective audit trail analysis, we have formulated a taxonomy of confidentiality breaches. By considering scenarios in which an inappropriate access might occur, we have identified \"indicators\" of confidentiality breaches, which may be thought of as evidence suggesting the possibility that a confidentiality breach has occurred. The collection of facts needed to describe the indicators provides insight into the types of information needed to improve confidentiality breach detection. Much of the information needed is unlikely to be available in the patient record. Research is needed exploring means of collecting and utilizing information from sources other than the patient record for use in improving patient information security.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum, one of the leading smart contract blockchain platforms, currently operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism designed to secure the network while incentivizing desired validator behaviors. Despite blockchain technology's promise of decentralization, limitations and gaps in decentralization persist, posing challenges for analysis and optimization. This study introduces a comprehensive dataset of validator rewards from the Ethereum Beacon chain, categorized into attestation, proposer, and sync committee rewards. By providing granular, transparent, and auditable records of validator activities, the dataset addresses the fragmentation of raw blockchain data and enables robust evaluations of PoS incentive structures. Researchers can leverage this dataset to assess enforceable rules, verify protocol compliance, and analyze long-term validator behavior. In addition, we apply decentralization metrics such as the Shannon entropy, Gini Index, Nakamoto Coefficient, and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to showcase the dataset's utility in studying decentralization trends. Publicly available on Harvard Dataverse and accompanied by open-source analytical tools on GitHub, this dataset facilitates future research aimed at enhancing blockchain systems' decentralization, security, and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Most modern vehicles are connected to the internet via cellular networks for navigation, assistance, etc. via their onboard computer, which can also provide onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services. The main in-vehicle communication buses (CAN, LIN, FlexRay) converge at the vehicle's onboard computer and offer no computer security features to protect the communication between nodes, thus being highly vulnerable to local and remote cyberattacks which target the onboard computer and/or the vehicle's electronic control units through the aforementioned buses. To date, several computer security proposals for CAN and FlexRay buses have been published; a formal computer security proposal for the LIN bus communications has not been presented. So, we researched possible security mechanisms suitable for this bus's particularities, tested those mechanisms in microcontroller and PSoC hardware, and developed a prototype LIN network using PSoC nodes programmed with computer security features. This work presents a novel combination of encryption and a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) scheme with replay attack rejection for the LIN communications. The obtained results are promising and show the feasibility of the implementation of an LIN network with real-time computer security protection.",

    "title": "A Novel QKD Approach to Enhance IIOT Privacy and Computational Knacks.",
    "abstract": "The industry-based internet of things (IIoT) describes how IIoT devices enhance and extend their capabilities for production amenities, security, and efficacy. IIoT establishes an enterprise-to-enterprise setup that means industries have several factories and manufacturing units that are dependent on other sectors for their services and products. In this context, individual industries need to share their information with other external sectors in a shared environment which may not be secure. The capability to examine and inspect such large-scale information and perform analytical protection over the large volumes of personal and organizational information demands authentication and confidentiality so that the total data are not endangered after illegal access by hackers and other unauthorized persons. In parallel, these large volumes of confidential industrial data need to be processed within reasonable time for effective deliverables. Currently, there are many mathematical-based symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic approaches and identity- and attribute-based public key cryptographic approaches that exist to address the abovementioned concerns and limitations such as computational overheads and taking more time for crucial generation as part of the encipherment and decipherment process for large-scale data privacy and security. In addition, the required key for the encipherment and decipherment process may be generated by a third party which may be compromised and lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, brute force attacks, etc. In parallel, there are some other quantum key distribution approaches available to produce keys for the encipherment and decipherment process without the need for a third party. However, there are still some attacks such as photon number splitting attacks and faked state attacks that may be possible with these existing QKD approaches. The primary motivation of our work is to address and avoid such abovementioned existing problems with better and optimal computational overhead for key generation, encipherment, and the decipherment process compared to the existing conventional models. To overcome the existing problems, we proposed a novel dynamic quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm for critical public infrastructure, which will secure all cyber-physical systems as part of IIoT. In this paper, we used novel multi-state qubit representation to support enhanced dynamic, chaotic quantum key generation with high efficiency and low computational overhead. Our proposed QKD algorithm can create a chaotic set of qubits that act as a part of session-wise dynamic keys used to encipher the IIoT-based large scales of information for secure communication and distribution of sensitive information.",

    "abstract": "Despite the long history of digital radiology, one of its most critical aspects--information security--still remains extremely underdeveloped and poorly standardized. To study the current state of radiology security, we explored the worldwide security of medical image archives. Using the DICOM data-transmitting standard, we implemented a highly parallel application to scan the entire World Wide Web of networked computers and devices, locating open and unprotected radiology servers. We used only legal and radiology-compliant tools. Our security-probing application initiated a standard DICOM handshake to remote computer or device addresses, and then assessed their security posture on the basis of handshake replies. The scan discovered a total of 2774 unprotected radiology or DICOM servers worldwide. Of those, 719 were fully open to patient data communications. Geolocation was used to analyze and rank our findings according to country utilization. As a result, we built maps and world ranking of clinical security, suggesting that even the most radiology-advanced countries have hospitals with serious security gaps. Despite more than two decades of active development and implementation, our radiology data still remains insecure. The results provided should be applied to raise awareness and begin an earnest dialogue toward elimination of the problem. The application we designed and the novel scanning approach we developed can be used to identify security breaches and to eliminate them before they are compromised.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices supporting intelligent cloud applications such as healthcare for hospitals rely on connecting with local base stations and access points to provide rich data analysis and real-time services to users. Devices authenticate with local base stations and perform handover operations to connect with access points with higher signal strength. Attackers disguise as valid base stations and access points using publicly accessible SSID information connect with local IoT devices during the handover process and give rise to data integrity and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a lightweight authentication scheme for private blockchain-based networks for securing devices from rogue base stations during the handover process. An authentication certificate is designed for base stations and machines in local clusters using SHA256 and modulo operations for enabling quick handover operations. The keys assigned to each device and base station joining the network are hashed, and their sizes are reduced using modulo operations. Furthermore, the compressed key size forms a certificate, which is used by the machines and the base stations to authenticate mutually. In comparison with existing studies, the performance analysis of the proposed scheme is based on the transmission of three messages required for completing the authentication process. Evaluation based on the Communication Overhead demonstrates a minimum improvement of 99.30% fewer bytes exchanged during the handover process and 89.58% reduced Storage Overhead compared with existing studies.",

    "abstract": "The unauthorized replication and distribution of digital images pose significant challenges to copyright protection. While existing solutions incorporate blockchain-based techniques such as perceptual hashing and digital watermarking, they lack large-scale experimental validation and a dedicated blockchain consensus protocol for image copyright management. This paper introduces DRPChain, a novel digital image copyright management system that addresses these issues. DRPChain employs an efficient cropping-resistant robust image hashing algorithm to defend against 14 common image attacks, demonstrating an 85% success rate in watermark extraction, 10% higher than the original scheme. Moreover, the paper designs the K-Raft consensus algorithm tailored for image copyright protection. Comparative experiments with Raft and benchmarking against PoW and PBFT algorithms show that K-Raft reduces block error rates by 2%, improves efficiency by 300ms compared to Raft, and exhibits superior efficiency,decentralization, and throughput compared to PoW and PBFT. These advantages make K-Raft more suitable for digital image copyright protection. This research contributes valuable insights into using blockchain technology for digital copyright protection, providing a solid foundation for future exploration.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to introduce the use of the agile governance theory in improving the identification and processing speed of distorted health information on the internet to ensure the security of public health information and maintain the authenticity of the network environment. Use literature research and content analysis to summarize the governance challenges of distorted health information and the shortcomings of governance responses. The governance of distorted health information encounters difficulties such as the rapid release of information, frequent updates, and the diversity and anonymity of information publishers. The current countermeasures against distorted health information mainly include community participation, technological means of monitoring, cross-platform cooperation, and data-driven governance. However, existing countermeasures still suffer from the governance process relying on community participation, poor cross-platform collaboration, limited application of algorithms, and insufficient enforcement of information regulation. These shortcomings affect the effectiveness and timeliness of countermeasures against disinformation, and there is an urgent need to further optimize and improve governance mechanisms. To assess the advantages of agile governance theory in the governance of distorted health information, and propose that the agile governance model of distorted health information contains three dimensions, namely, data empowerment, process reengineering, and role reconstruction, and that the implementation path is based on regulations and stipulations, scientific and technological empowerment, and educational guidance, and the interaction of these three dimensions achieves the ability of agile governance of distorted health information with rapid perception, flexible response, and continuous coordination.",

Human life is involved in enormous applications such as intelligent transportation, intelligent healthcare, smart grid, smart city, etc. A thriving surface is created that can affect society, the economy, the environment, politics, and health through diverse security threats. Generally, IoT devices are susceptible to security breaches, and the development of industrial systems could pose devastating security vulnerabilities. To build a reliable security shield, the challenges encountered must be embraced. Therefore, this survey paper is primarily aimed to assist researchers by classifying attacks/vulnerabilities based on objects. The method of attacks and relevant countermeasures are provided for each kind of attack in this work. Case studies of the most important applications of the IoT are highlighted concerning security solutions. The survey of security solutions is not limited to traditional secret key-based cryptographic solutions, moreover physical unclonable functions (PUF)-based solutions and blockchain are illustrated. The pros and cons of each security solution are also discussed here. Furthermore, challenges and recommendations are presented in this work.",

    "abstract": "Sharing scientific data is an effective means to rationally exploit scientific data and is vital to promote the development of the industrial chain and improve the level of science and technology. In recent years, the popularity of the open data platform has increased, but problems remain, including imperfect system architecture, unsound privacy and security, and non-standardized interaction data. To address these problems, the blockchain's decentralization, smart contracts, distributed storage, and other features can be used as the core technology for open data systems. This paper addresses the problems of opening, allocation-right confirmation, sharing, and rational use of wild-bird data from Yunnan Province, China. A data storage model is proposed based on the blockchain and interstellar file system and is applied to wild-bird data to overcome the mutual distrust between ornithology institutions in the collaborative processing and data storage of bird data. The model provides secure storage and secure access control of bird data in the cloud, thereby ensuring the decentralized and secure storage of wild-bird data for multiple research institutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, global healthcare has made great progress with the use of Internet of Things technology. However, for there to be excellent patient care, there must be a high degree of safety for the IoT health system. There has been a massive increase in hacking systems and the theft of sensitive and highly confidential information from large health centers and hospitals. That is why establishing a highly secure and reliable healthcare system has become a top priority. In this paper, a security scheme for the IoT-enabled healthcare environment, LBSS, is proposed. This security scheme comprises three security mechanisms. The first mechanism is based on the blockchain technology and is used for transaction integrity. The second mechanism is used to store the healthcare system data in a secure manner through the distribution of its data records among multiple servers. The third mechanism is used to access the healthcare data after applying a proposed authorization test. To minimize the security overhead, the healthcare data is prioritized in regard to its importance. Therefore, each security mechanism has specific steps for each level of data importance. Finally, the NS3 package is used to construct a simulation environment for IoT-enabled healthcare systems to measure the proposed security scheme performance. The simulation results proved that the proposed healthcare security scheme outperformed the traditional models in regard to the performance metrics.",

    "abstract": "The existence of malicious participants is a major threat for authenticated group key exchange (AGKE) protocols. Typically, there are two detecting ways (passive and active) to resist malicious participants in AGKE protocols. In 2012, the revocable identity- (ID-) based public key system (R-IDPKS) was proposed to solve the revocation problem in the ID-based public key system (IDPKS). Afterwards, based on the R-IDPKS, Wu et al. proposed a revocable ID-based AGKE (RID-AGKE) protocol, which adopted a passive detecting way to resist malicious participants. However, it needs three rounds and cannot identify malicious participants. In this paper, we fuse a noninteractive confirmed computation technique to propose the first two-round RID-AGKE protocol with identifying malicious participants, which is an active detecting way. We demonstrate that our protocol is a provably secure AGKE protocol with forward secrecy and can identify malicious participants. When compared with the recently proposed ID/RID-AGKE protocols, our protocol possesses better performance and more robust security properties.",

These are connected to each other using both infrastructure-based as well as short-range ad hoc networks. Limited Internet connectivity limits the use of conventional security mechanisms such as public key infrastructures and other forms of server-centric authentication. Under these circumstances, peer-to-peer interactions are well suited for not just information interchange, but also managing security and privacy. However, practical solutions for protecting mobile devices, preserving privacy, evaluating trust and determining the reliability and accuracy of peer-provided data in such interactions are still in their infancy. Our research is directed towards providing stronger assurances of the reliability and trustworthiness of information and services, and the use of declarative policy-driven approaches to handle the open and dynamic nature of such systems.

A WBAN allows biosensors to collect and communicate human physiological data using wireless communication. The communication security of the collected data in WBAN is a major concern. Because of the dependability of cryptographic schemes for key management, these have become an important aspect of this security. However, the extremely constrained nature of biosensors has made designing key management schemes a challenging task. For this reason, many lightweight key management schemes have been proposed to overcome these constraints. In this article, we present a review of the state of the art of these solutions. We classify the WBAN schemes into three classes and evaluate them based on adequate metrics for key management in WBAN.",

    "abstract": "Resource constraint Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) is controlled through gateway devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, etc.) that are connected to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers or cloud regulated by a third party. Recently Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in automation, consumer behavior analysis, device quality upgradation, etc. Typical ML predicts by analyzing customers' raw data in a centralized system which raises the security and privacy issues such as data leakage, privacy violation, single point of failure, etc. To overcome the problems, Federated Learning (FL) developed an initial solution to ensure services without sharing personal data. In FL, a centralized aggregator collaborates and makes an average for a global model used for the next round of training. However, the centralized aggregator raised the same issues, such as a single point of control leaking the updated model and interrupting the entire process. Additionally, research claims data can be retrieved from model parameters. Beyond that, since the Gateway (GW) device has full access to the raw data, it can also threaten the entire ecosystem. This research contributes a blockchain-controlled, edge intelligence federated learning framework for a distributed learning platform for CIoT. The federated learning platform allows collaborative learning with users' shared data, and the blockchain network replaces the centralized aggregator and ensures secure participation of gateway devices in the ecosystem. Furthermore, blockchain is trustless, immutable, and anonymous, encouraging CIoT end users to participate. We evaluated the framework and federated learning outcomes using the well-known Stanford Cars dataset. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Encryption of patient information has become an important issue in medical ultrasound instrumentation to secure information when images are accessed off-site. The proposed algorithm is used to encrypt private medical images and transfer the encrypted images to improve the encryption capability and elapsed time. We generate a public key using three prime numbers, including a fixed Mersenne prime number, in the modified Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) algorithm to compare the encryption capability. We calculated and compared the elapsed time using the modified RSA algorithm with a breast phantom in the medical ultrasound imaging instrumentation. The encryption capability is improved because the elapsed time when using three prime numbers is longer (1.2337 s) than that when using two prime numbers (1.0712 s). However, the elapsed time using fixed Mersenne prime numbers (0.8360 s) is a similar to that using two prime numbers (0.8389 s). Our proposed cryptographic algorithm provides improved encryption in medical ultrasound imaging compared to algorithms that use two prime numbers that are not Mersenne prime numbers, while transmitting images with adequate elapsed times.",

    "title": "Preventing shoulder-surfing attack with the concept of concealing the password objects' information.",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, picture-based password systems employ password objects (pictures/icons/symbols) as input during an authentication session, thus making them vulnerable to \"shoulder-surfing\" attack because the visual interface by function is easily observed by others. Recent software-based approaches attempt to minimize this threat by requiring users to enter their passwords indirectly by performing certain mental tasks to derive the indirect password, thus concealing the user's actual password. However, weaknesses in the positioning of distracter and password objects introduce usability and security issues. In this paper, a new method, which conceals information about the password objects as much as possible, is proposed. Besides concealing the password objects and the number of password objects, the proposed method allows both password and distracter objects to be used as the challenge set's input. The correctly entered password appears to be random and can only be derived with the knowledge of the full set of password objects. Therefore, it would be difficult for a shoulder-surfing adversary to identify the user's actual password. Simulation results indicate that the correct input object and its location are random for each challenge set, thus preventing frequency of occurrence analysis attack. User study results show that the proposed method is able to prevent shoulder-surfing attack.",

    "abstract": "In human-machine interfaces, decoder calibration is critical to enable an effective and seamless interaction with the machine. However, recalibration is often necessary as the decoder off-line predictive power does not generally imply ease-of-use, due to closed loop dynamics and user adaptation that cannot be accounted for during the calibration procedure. Here, we propose an adaptive interface that makes use of a non-linear autoencoder trained iteratively to perform online manifold identification and tracking, with the dual goal of reducing the need for interface recalibration and enhancing human-machine joint performance. Importantly, the proposed approach avoids interrupting the operation of the device and it neither relies on information about the state of the task, nor on the existence of a stable neural or movement manifold, allowing it to be applied in the earliest stages of interface operation, when the formation of new neural strategies is still on-going. In order to more directly test the performance of our algorithm, we defined the autoencoder latent space as the control space of a body-machine interface. After an initial offline parameter tuning, we evaluated the performance of the adaptive interface versus that of a static decoder in approximating the evolving low-dimensional manifold of users simultaneously learning to perform reaching movements within the latent space. Results show that the adaptive approach increased the representational efficiency of the interface decoder. Concurrently, it significantly improved users' task-related performance, indicating that the development of a more accurate internal model is encouraged by the online co-adaptation process.",

    "abstract": "Plastic surgery offices are subject to a wide variety of cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks that encrypt the plastic surgeon's information and make it unusable, as well as data theft and disclosure attacks that threaten to disclose confidential patient information. Cloud-based office systems increase the attack surface and do not mitigate the effects of breaches that can result in theft of credentials. Although employee education is often recommended to avoid the threats, a single error by a single employee has often led to security breaches, and it is unreasonable to expect that no employee will ever make an error. Recognition of the 2 most common vectors of these breaches-compromised email attachments and surfing to compromised websites-allows the use of technical networking tools to prevent both email attachments from being received and employee use of unsanctioned and potentially compromised websites. Furthermore, once compromised code has been allowed to run within the office network, that code must necessarily make outbound connections to exploit the breach. Preventing that outbound traffic can mitigate the effects of a breach. However, most small office network consultants design firewalls to only limit incoming network traffic and fail to implement technical measures to stop the unauthorized outbound traffic that is necessary for most network attacks. The authors provide detailed techniques that can be used to direct information technology consultants to properly limit outbound network traffic as well as incoming email attachments.",

Hence, the security of the network, data and sensor devices is a paramount concern in the IoT network as it grows very fast in terms of exchanged data and interconnected sensor nodes. This paper analyses the authentication and access control method using in the Internet of Things presented by Jing et al. (Authentication and Access Control in the Internet of Things. In Proceedings of the 2012 32nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, Macau, China, 18-21 June 2012, pp. 588-592). According to our analysis, Jing et al.'s protocol is costly in the message exchange and the security assessment is not strong enough for such a protocol. Therefore, we propose improvements to the protocol to fill the discovered weakness gaps. The protocol enhancements facilitate many services to the users such as user anonymity, mutual authentication, and secure session key establishment. Finally, the performance and security analysis show that the improved protocol possesses many advantages against popular attacks, and achieves better efficiency at low communication cost.",

    "abstract": "Internal auditing demands innovative and secure solutions in today's business environment, with increasing competitive pressure and frequent occurrences of risky and illegal behaviours. Blockchain along with secure databases like encryption improves internal audit security through immutability and transparency. Hence integrating blockchain with homomorphic encryption and multi-factor authentication improves privacy and mitigates computational overhead. Recently, blockchain applications for internal audits in the enterprise sector are still emerging. Thus, blockchain technology in auditing provides the benefits of enhanced transparency and immutability in data processing, which can establish new solutions for internal auditing but still lacks encryption techniques. The research proposed a framework called \"BlockCryptoAudit\" to enhance internal audit processes through cryptographic encryption methods and blockchain technology, ensuring secure and transparent audit operations. The proposed approach integrates an additive homomorphic Paillier encryption scheme with blockchain to create a safe and tamper-resident audit trail. Utilizing homomorphic Paillier encryption, BlockCryptoAudit ensures that computations may be performed on encrypted audit data while safeguarding data privacy. The applied blockchain hyperledger component guarantees the immutability and transparency of encrypted audit records, resulting in a decentralized and tamper-resistant record. By limiting data accessibility to authorized individuals based on specified responsibilities, role-based access restrictions handled using smart contracts further strengthen security. The study protects audit data's security and confidentiality by encrypting it and putting it on a blockchain. The study compares the proposed BlockCryptoAudit with models like B-OAP, BSE-DF, and EG-FLB regarding risk mitigation, audit quality, security overhead, and audit trail effectiveness. With little security overhead, BlockCryptoAudit beats out B-OAP, BSE-DF, and EG-FLB in terms of risk mitigation (98%) and audit quality (99%).

    "abstract": "Studying rare outcomes, new interventions and diverse populations often requires collaborations across multiple health research partners. However, transferring healthcare research data from one institution to another can increase the risk of data privacy and security breaches. A working group of multi-site research programmers evaluated the need for tools to support data security and data privacy. The group determined that data privacy support tools should: 1) allow for a range of allowable Protected Health Information (PHI); 2) clearly identify what type of data should be protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); and 3) help analysts identify which protected health information data elements are allowable in a given project and how they should be protected during data transfer. Based on these requirements we developed two performance support tools to support data programmers and site analysts in exchanging research data. The first tool, a workplan template, guides the lead programmer through effectively communicating the details of multi-site programming, including how to run the program, what output the program will create, and whether the output is expected to contain protected health information. The second performance support tool is a checklist that site analysts can use to ensure that multi-site program output conforms to expectations and does not contain protected health information beyond what is allowed under the multi-site research agreements. Together the two tools create a formal multi-site programming workflow designed to reduce the chance of accidental PHI disclosure.",

The approach of data fusion and the decision level fusion technique are also implemented to achieve enhanced accuracy. This study examines the numerous key components and features of the smart home network framework more extensively. The Fused RTS-DELM technique achieves a very significant level of stability with a low error rate for any intrusion activity in smart home networks.

    "abstract": "In order to study the relationship between genes and diseases, the increasing availability and sharing of phenotypic and genotypic data have been promoted as an imperative within the scientific community. In parallel with data sharing practices by clinicians and researchers, recent initiatives have been observed in which individuals are sharing personal genomic data. The involvement of individuals in such initiatives is facilitated by the increased accessibility of personal genomic data, offered by private test providers along with availability of online networks. Personal webpages and on-line data sharing platforms such as Consent to Research (Portable Legal Consent), Free the Data, and Genomes Unzipped are being utilized to host and share genotypes, electronic health records and family history uploaded by individuals. Although personal genomic data sharing initiatives vary in nature, the emphasis on the individuals' control on their data in order to benefit research and ultimately health care has seen as a key theme across these initiatives. In line with the growing practice of personal genomic data sharing, this paper aims to shed light on the potential challenges surrounding these initiatives. As in the course of these initiatives individuals are solicited to individually balance the risks and benefits of sharing their genomic data, their awareness of the implications of personal genomic data sharing for themselves and their family members is a necessity. Furthermore, given the sensitivity of genomic data and the controversies around their complete de-identifiability, potential privacy risks and harms originating from unintended uses of data have to be taken into consideration.",

However, fiber nonlinearity introduces highly correlated distortions on identical signals and diminishes the benefit of coherent superposition in nonlinear transmission regime. Here we experimentally demonstrate that through coordinated scrambling of signal constellations at the transmitter, together with appropriate unscrambling at the receiver, the full benefit of coherent superposition is retained in the nonlinear transmission regime of a space-diversity fiber link based on an innovatively engineered multi-core fiber. This scrambled coherent superposition may provide the flexibility of trading communication capacity for performance in future optical fiber networks, and may open new possibilities in high-performance and secure optical communications.",

We undertake a survey of published principles of data governance of large neuro-ICT projects. This grounds an approach to a normative analysis of current data governance approaches. Several ethical issues are well covered in the data governance policies of neuro-ICT projects, notably data protection and attribution of work. Projects use a set of similar policies to ensure users behave appropriately. However, many ethical issues are not covered at all. Implementation and enforcement of policies remain vague. The data governance policies we investigated indicate that the neuro-ICT research community is currently close-knit and that shared assumptions are reflected in infrastructural aspects. This explains why many ethical issues are not explicitly included in data governance policies at present. With neuro-ICT research growing in scale, scope, and international involvement, these shared assumptions should be made explicit and reflected in data governance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the increased availability of lower-cost telecommunications systems and customized patients monitoring devices made it possible to bring the advantages of telemedicine directly into the patient's home. These telecare medicine information systems enable health-care delivery services. These systems are moving towards an environment where automated patient medical records and electronically interconnected telecare facilities are prevalent. Authentication, security, patient's privacy protection and data confidentiality are important for patient or doctor accessing to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A secure authentication scheme will be required to achieve these goals. Many schemes based on cryptography have been proposed to achieve the goals. However, many schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, and are neither efficient, nor user friendly. Specially, in terms of efficiency, some schemes are resulting in high time cost. In this paper we propose a new authentication scheme that is using the precomputing to avoid the time-consuming exponential computations. Finally, it is shown to be more secure and practical for telecare medicine environments.",

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Methods for Feature Engineering Using Blockchain: Review, Evaluation, and Proof of Concept.",
    "abstract": "The protection of private data is a key responsibility for research studies that collect identifiable information from study participants. Limiting the scope of data collection and preventing secondary use of the data are effective strategies for managing these risks. An ideal framework for data collection would incorporate feature engineering, a process where secondary features are derived from sensitive raw data in a secure environment without a trusted third party. This study aimed to compare current approaches based on how they maintain data privacy and the practicality of their implementations. These approaches include traditional approaches that rely on trusted third parties, and cryptographic, secure hardware, and blockchain-based techniques. A set of properties were defined for evaluating each approach. A qualitative comparison was presented based on these properties. The evaluation of each approach was framed with a use case of sharing geolocation data for biomedical research. We found that approaches that rely on a trusted third party for preserving participant privacy do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees that sensitive data will not be exposed in modern data ecosystems. Cryptographic techniques incorporate strong privacy-preserving paradigms but are appropriate only for select use cases or are currently limited because of computational complexity. Blockchain smart contracts alone are insufficient to provide data privacy because transactional data are public. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) may have hardware vulnerabilities and lack visibility into how data are processed. Hybrid approaches combining blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and TEEs provide promising frameworks for privacy preservation. For reference, we provide a software implementation where users can privately share features of their geolocation data using the hybrid approach combining blockchain with TEEs as a supplement. Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable the development of new privacy-preserving feature engineering methods by obviating dependence on trusted parties and providing immutable, auditable data processing workflows. The overlap between blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and secure hardware technologies are promising fields for addressing important data privacy needs. Hybrid blockchain and TEE frameworks currently provide practical tools for implementing experimental privacy-preserving applications.",

    "abstract": "Is it possible to use the Internet as a secure media for transport of telemedicine? Which risks exist for routine use? In this article state of the art methods of security were analysed. Telemedicine in the Internet has severe risks, because patient data and hospital data of a secure Intranet can be manipulated by connecting it to the Web. Establishing of a firewall and the introduction of HPC (Health Professional Card) are minimizing the risk of un-authorized access to the hospital server. HPC allows good safety with digital signature and authentication of host and client of medical data. For secure e-mail PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is easy to use as a standard protocol. Planning all activities exactly as well as following legal regulations are important requisites for reduction of safety risks in Internet.",

This platform works on an interoperable collection of standards for addressing, security and content-description. In this context the security for application and transport data is based on data protection as well as medical non-disclosure rules. The methods of cryptography can provide security services for data transmitted realizing addressed, direct and indirect privacy. The first German health professional card, the electronic physicians' ID, provides central tools for such applications.

In specific, a TTP is used to generate, distribute, and revoke digital certificates to/from medical practitioners and healthcare organizations wishing to communicate in a secure way. Digital certificates and digital signatures are, in particular, used to provide peer and data origin authentication and access control functionalities. We also propose a logical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture, which is robust, scalable, and based on standards. This architecture aims at supporting large-scale healthcare applications. It supports openness, scalability, flexibility and extensibility, and can be integrated with existing TTP schemes and infrastructures offering transparency and adequate security. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed architecture enjoys all desirable usability characteristics, and meets the set of criteria, which constitutes an applicable framework for the development of trusted medical services over the Web.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications bring evolved and intelligent services that can help improve users' daily lives. These applications include home automation, health care, and smart agriculture. However, IoT development and adoption face various security and privacy challenges that need to be overcome. As a promising security paradigm, context-aware security enables one to enforce security and privacy mechanisms adaptively. Moreover, with the advancements in edge computing, context-aware security services can dynamically be placed close to a user's location and enable the support of low latency communication and mobility. Therefore, the design of an adaptive and decentralized access control mechanism becomes a necessity. In this paper, we propose a decentralized context-aware authorization management as a service based on the blockchain. The proposed architecture extends the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework with blockchain technology and context-awareness capabilities. Instead of a classic Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth) access token, it uses a new contextual access token. The evaluation results show our proposition's effectiveness and advantages in terms of usability, security, low latency, and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "The determination of the relation between a number and a numerical interval is one of the core problems in the scientific calculation of privacy protection. The calculation of the relationship between two numbers and a numerical interval to protect privacy is also the basic problem of collaborative computing. It is widely used in data queries, location search and other fields. At present, most of the solutions are still fundamentally limited to the integer level, and there are few solutions at the real number level. To solve these problems, this paper first uses Bernoulli inequality generalization and a monotonic function property to extend the solution to the real number level and designs two new protocols based on the homomorphic encryption scheme, which can not only protect the data privacy of both parties involved in the calculation, but also extend the number domain to real numbers. In addition, this paper designs a solution to the confidential cooperative determination problem between real numbers by using the sign function and homomorphism multiplication. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed solution is safe and efficient. Finally, some extension applications based on this protocol are given.",

Moreover, policies that fail to take into account all the aspects of HIS security, the legal and regulatory requirements, and the existence of several stakeholders may lead to ineffective or inefficient security measures. Policies of a special category, named Generic Security Policies (GSP), should be developed to provide policy-level harmonisation and guidance to policy-makers within HCE.

    "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in medical, financial, energy and other fields. However, in the process of practical application, each blockchain is a small independent ecosystem, with all transactions and operations limited to the chain, resulting in a large number of mutually heterogeneous to independent blockchains. It presents challenges for cross-chain interactions, cross-organization data sharing, and cross-blockchain expansion, and hinders the wider application of blockchain technology. In addition, the traditional digital signature method based on elliptic curve cipher faces the threat of being cracked by quantum computing attacks. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper proposed a blockchain smart contract technique based on quantum computing attack resistance(BSCTQCAT). The technique first introduces the digital signature of the lattice cipher into the blockchain to resist the quantum search algorithm attack. Then, based on the smart contract authentication scheme, the nodes on multiple heterogeneous chains are organized into an identity agent layer P2P network, through which transactions on the chain will establish a credible identity management and message authentication mechanism between different chains, solving the current problem that each chain is difficult to communicate with each other. In this paper, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by simulating the Bitcoin transaction scenario and analyzing the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Eliminating unnecessary exposure is a principle of server security. The huge IPv6 address space enhances security by making scanning infeasible, however, with recent advances of IPv6 scanning technologies, network scanning is again threatening server security. In this paper, we propose a new model named addressless server, which separates the server into an entrance module and a main service module, and assigns an IPv6 prefix instead of an IPv6 address to the main service module. The entrance module generates a legitimate IPv6 address under this prefix by encrypting the client address, so that the client can access the main server on a destination address that is different in each connection. In this way, the model provides isolation to the main server, prevents network scanning, and minimizes exposure. Moreover it provides a novel framework that supports flexible load balancing, high-availability, and other desirable features. The model is simple and does not require any modification to the client or the network. We implement a prototype and experiments show that our model can prevent the main server from being scanned at a slight performance cost.",

    "abstract": "This work intends to comprehensively analyze the application of blockchain technology in enterprise financial accounting information sharing and address prevalent issues such as information opacity, data tampering, and data security in the current practices. Therefore, it writes smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform to achieve the secure sharing of financial accounting information between enterprises. This work employs a randomized experimental design approach, using a computer-generated random number program to divide 100 enterprises into experimental and control groups, each comprising 50 enterprises. Enterprises in the experimental group share financial accounting information using smart contracts on the Ethereum platform during the experiment. The financial personnel of these enterprises upload reconciled data to the corresponding smart contracts using the enterprise's digital signatures after each month's accounting process. Enterprises in the control group continue to use traditional methods of financial accounting information sharing (such as email and web platforms) to share financial data files directly. Quantitative analysis is performed to compare the data between the experimental and control groups. Empirical results reveal a notable enhancement in information-sharing efficiency by 25.7%, a 19.8% improvement in data accuracy, and a 13.6% reduction in financial information-sharing costs within the experimental group compared to the control group. This work provides compelling evidence that adopting blockchain-based information-sharing methods can effectively elevate data trustworthiness and security. Supported by systematic empirical findings, this work validates the significant potential of blockchain technology in the realm of enterprise financial accounting information sharing.",

    "abstract": "Random bit generators (RBGs) constitute an important tool in cryptography, stochastic simulations and secure communications. The later in particular has some difficult requirements: high generation rate of unpredictable bit strings and secure key-exchange protocols over public channels. Deterministic algorithms generate pseudo-random number sequences at high rates, however, their unpredictability is limited by the very nature of their deterministic origin. Recently, physical RBGs based on chaotic semiconductor lasers were shown to exceed Gbit/s rates. Whether secure synchronization of two high rate physical RBGs is possible remains an open question. Here we propose a method, whereby two fast RBGs based on mutually coupled chaotic lasers, are synchronized. Using information theoretic analysis we demonstrate security against a powerful computational eavesdropper, capable of noiseless amplification, where all parameters are publicly known. The method is also extended to secure synchronization of a small network of three RBGs.",

    "title": "Performance Evaluation and Cyberattack Mitigation in a Blockchain-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Framework.",
    "abstract": "With the electric power grid experiencing a rapid shift to the smart grid paradigm over a deregulated energy market, Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions are gaining prominence, and innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading at a micro level is being deployed. Such advancement, however, leaves traditional security models vulnerable and paves the path for blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT), with its decentralized, open, and transparency characteristics as a viable alternative. However, due to deregulation in energy trading markets, most of the prototype resilience regarding cybersecurity attack, performance and scalability of transaction broadcasting, and its direct impact on overall performances and attacks are required to be supported, which becomes a performance bottleneck with existing blockchain solutions such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and so on. In this paper, we design a novel permissioned Corda framework for P2P energy trading peers that not only mitigates a new class of cyberattacks, i.e., delay trading (or discard), but also disseminates the transactions in a optimized propagation time, resulting in a fair transaction distribution. Sharing transactions in a permissioned R3 Corda blockchain framework is handled by the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and transport layer security (TLS). The unique contribution of this paper lies in the use of an optimized CPU and JVM heap memory scenario analysis with P2P metric in addition to a far more realistic multihosted testbed for the performance analysis. The average latencies measured are 22 ms and 51 ms for sending and receiving messages. We compare the throughput by varying different types of flow such as energy request, request + pay, transfer, multiple notary, sender, receiver, and single notary. In the proposed framework, request is an energy asset that is based on payment state and contract in the P2P energy trading module, so in request flow, only one node with no notary appears on the vault of the node.Energy request + pay flow interaction deals with two nodes, such as producer and consumer, to deal with request and transfer of asset ownership with the help of a notary. Request + repeated pay flow request, on node A and repeatedly transfers a fraction of energy asset state to another node, B, through a notary.",

In the first part, we explain when the GDPR is applicable, who is accountable for data protection, and what is covered by the notions of personal data and processing. In the second part, we explain aspects of the GDPR that are relevant for researchers within the field of health psychology (e.g., obtaining informed consent, data minimisation, and open science). We focus on questions that researchers may ask themselves in their daily practice. Compliance with the GDPR requires adopting research practices (e.g., data minimisation and anonymization procedures) that are not yet commonly used, but serve the fundamental right to protection of personal data of study participants.",

Now the research of the determination of observations is still lacking, and it shows a certain degree of subjectivity. In this regard, we integrate the attack intentions and hidden Markov model (HMM) and support a method to forecasting multistep attack based on hidden Markov model. Firstly, we train the existing hidden Markov model(s) by the Baum-Welch algorithm of HMM. Then we recognize the alert belonging to attack scenarios with the Forward algorithm of HMM. Finally, we forecast the next possible attack sequence with the Viterbi algorithm of HMM. The results of simulation experiments show that the hidden Markov models which have been trained are better than the untrained in recognition and prediction.",

In this paper, the existence forms of network security hazards based on the blockchain are explored to establish a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. In security sharing, network blockchains are often maintained by many parties. This poses new potential threats and challenges to privacy protection in these multiparty network blockchains. This paper proposes a research scheme for a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. The tampering of the protected network blockchain is prevented by blockchain, and the fuzzy logic algorithm is used to ensure its confidentiality. This solution allows the exchange in the protected network blockchain and the security of transaction information based on the fuzzy logic algorithm. According to the results of the experiments, this method can ensure security sharing of the network blockchain with high practicality and achieve the expected design effect.",

Securing all devices could be a huge task and require lots of computational power, and can be a bottleneck for devices with fewer computational resources. To improve the authentication mechanism, many researchers have proposed decentralized applications such as blockchain technology for securing fog and IoT environments. Ethereum is considered a popular blockchain platform and is used by researchers to implement the authentication mechanism due to its programable smart contract. In this research, we proposed a secure authentication mechanism with improved performance. Neo blockchain is a platform that has properties that can provide improved security and faster execution. The research utilizes the intrinsic properties of Neo blockchain to develop a secure authentication mechanism. The proposed authentication mechanism is compared with the existing algorithms and shows that the proposed mechanism is 20 to 90 per cent faster in execution time and has over 30 to 70 per cent decrease in registration and authentication when compared to existing methods.",

In this context, we have conducted experimental research on the blockchain product traceability trusted data analysis consensus mechanism and reached the following conclusions. (1) There are decentralization, irreversible tampering, traceability, and openness through the blockchain's own information and other functions so that a series of processes from raw material production, transportation, and logistics sales are well documented. (2) Under the same network environment, if the number of matches in the system increases, the average matching time consumed by the original engine is greater than the average matching time on the optimized engine. For example, taking 10% of Byzantine nodes in the system, the number of consensus increases, the average ITPBFT consensus time is about 5.74 s, and the average consensus time of the PBFT consensus mechanism is about 6.13 s. As a decentralized distributed data management system through nodes, blockchain is widely used in financial transactions, copyright protection, and product areas such as tracking and access control. In this regard, we conducted an experimental study of the consensus mechanism to analyze reliable data on the traceability of blockchain products and came to the conclusion of the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Communication and co-operation in healthcare and welfare require a well-defined set of security services based on a standards-based interoperable security infrastructure and provided by a Trusted Third Party. Generally, the services describe status and relation of communicating principals, corresponding keys and attributes, and the access rights to both applications and data. Legal, social, behavioral and ethical requirements demand securely stored patient information and well-established access tools and tokens. Electronic signatures as means for securing integrity of messages and files, certified time stamps and time signatures are important for accessing and storing data in Electronic Health Record Systems. The key for all these services is a secure and reliable procedure for authentication (identification and verification). While mentioning technical problems (e.g. lifetime of the storage devices, migration of retrieval and presentation software), this paper aims at identifying harmonization and interoperability requirements of securing data items, files, messages, sets of archived items or documents, and life-long Electronic Health Records based on a secure certificate-based identification. It's commonly known that just relying on existing and emerging security standards does not necessarily guarantee interoperability of different security infrastructure approaches. So certificate separation can be a key to modern interoperable security infrastructure services.",

    "title": "Data Sharing Under the General Data Protection Regulation: Time to Harmonize Law and Research Ethics?",
    "abstract": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became binding law in the European Union Member States in 2018, as a step toward harmonizing personal data protection legislation in the European Union. The Regulation governs almost all types of personal data processing, hence, also, those pertaining to biomedical research. The purpose of this article is to highlight the main practical issues related to data and biological sample sharing that biomedical researchers face regularly, and to specify how these are addressed in the context of GDPR, after consulting with ethics/legal experts. We identify areas in which clarifications of the GDPR are needed, particularly those related to consent requirements by study participants. Amendments should target the following: (1) restricting exceptions based on national laws and increasing harmonization, (2) confirming the concept of broad consent, and (3) defining a roadmap for secondary use of data. These changes will be achieved by acknowledged learned societies in the field taking the lead in preparing a document giving guidance for the optimal interpretation of the GDPR, which will be finalized following a period of commenting by a broad multistakeholder audience. In parallel, promoting engagement and education of the public in the relevant issues (such as different consent types or residual risk for re-identification), on both local/national and international levels, is considered critical for advancement. We hope that this article will open this broad discussion involving all major stakeholders, toward optimizing the GDPR and allowing a harmonized transnational research approach.",

Also in AES, implementing S-Boxes consumes the major part of the total time consumed by the entire architecture. In this research paper, we propose a very low-power and high efficient S-Box circuit architecture: a multi-stage modified version of PPRM architecture over composite fields. In this modified S box design, only AND and Hazard transparent XOR gates are used. Because of this architecture dynamic hazards which form the main aspect of power consumption in S box gets eliminated. A low propagation delay of 4.58 ns and occupies 120 slices in the xilinx FPGA device xc6vlx75t-3ff784, while the low propagation delay and slice area is 5.552 ns and 120 respectively for the conventional PPRM architecture. This new proposed architecture is used to protect the mammographic images from being unauthorized access.",

The applications of AI in forensic disciplines such as medicine, forensic anthropology, digital forensics, and taphonomy have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of identification processes and the analysis of digital evidence. However, this rapid advancement prompts critical considerations in privacy, data protection, bias and fairness, and the accuracy and reliability of AI systems. The inherent challenges of the \"black box\" nature of AI algorithms call for transparency and accountability to maintain trust and uphold the integrity of forensic investigations. Ethical use, legal compliance, interdisciplinary collaboration, education, data integrity, standardization, human oversight, and societal impact, along with sustainability are identified as pivotal areas requiring urgent attention. The discussion underscores the need for rigorous scrutiny, standardized operating procedures, and proactive dialogue to ensure the responsible advancement of AI in forensic science.",

However, there are increasing concerns relating to the security of healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed medical devices to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Healthcare is an attractive target for cybercrime for two fundamental reasons: it is a rich source of valuable data and its defences are weak. Cybersecurity breaches include stealing health information and ransomware attacks on hospitals, and could include attacks on implanted medical devices. Breaches can reduce patient trust, cripple health systems and threaten human life. Ultimately, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety, yet has historically been lax. New legislation and regulations are in place to facilitate change. This requires cybersecurity to become an integral part of patient safety.

    "abstract": "Many researchers have introduced blockchain into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to support trading or other authentication applications between vehicles. However, the traditional blockchain cannot well support the query of transactions that occur in a specified area which is important for vehicle users since they are bound to the geolocations. Therefore, the querying efficiency of the geolocation attribute of transactions is vital for blockchain-based applications. Existing work does not well handle the geolocation of vehicles in the blockchain, and thus the querying efficiency is questionable. In this paper, we design a rapid query method of regional transactions in blockchain for IoV, including data structures and query algorithms. The main idea is to utilize the Geohash code to represent the area and serve as the key for transaction indexing and querying, and the geolocation is marked as one of the attributes of transactions in the blockchain. To further verify and evaluate the proposed design, on the basis of the implementation of Ethereum, which is a well-known blockchain, the results show that the proposed design achieves significantly better-querying speed than Ethereum.",

A review was conducted of the English literature with search terms 'online pharmacies', 'Internet pharmacies', 'cyber pharmacies', 'rogue pharmacies', and 'e-pharmacies' using PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar from 1999-2005. Illicit online pharmacies are a rapidly growing public health threat and are characterized by a number of complex and interrelated risk factors. Solutions are varied and are of questionable utility in the face of evolving technology that enables this form of transnational cybercrime. Legal, regulatory and technology solutions must address the entire illicit online pharmacy ecosystem in order to be effective. There is a critical need to build international consensus, conduct additional research and develop technology to combat illicit online pharmacies.",

Aiming at the problems of fuzzy boundary security protection and dynamic identity authentication in the edge computing environment in smart city, the zero trust architecture based on blockchain is studied, and a digital identity model and dynamic authentication scheme of edge computing nodes based on distributed ledger are proposed. Firstly, a digital identity model of two-way authentication between edge computing node and sensing terminal is established to realize fine-grained authorization and access control in edge computing. Secondly, based on the identity data and behavior log bookkeeping on the chain, the quantification of trust value, trust transmission and update are realized, and the traceability of security events is improved. Finally, based on the improved RAFT consensus algorithm, the multi-party consensus and consistency accounting in the authentication process are realized. Simulation results show that this scheme can meet the requirements of zero trust verification in edge computing environment, and has good efficiency and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Anonymization is a recognized process by which identifiers can be removed from identifiable data to protect an individual's confidentiality and is used as a standard practice when sharing data in biomedical research. However, a plethora of terms, such as coding, pseudonymization, unlinked, and deidentified, have been and continue to be used, leading to confusion and uncertainty. This article shows that this is a historic problem and argues that such continuing uncertainty regarding the levels of protection given to data risks damaging initiatives designed to assist researchers conducting cross-national studies and sharing data internationally. DataSHIELD and the creation of a legal template are used as examples of initiatives that rely on anonymization, but where the inconsistency in terminology could hinder progress. More broadly, this article argues that there is a real possibility that there could be possible damage to the public's trust in research and the institutions that carry it out by relying on vague notions of the anonymization process. Research participants whose lack of clear understanding of the research process is compensated for by trusting those carrying out the research may have that trust damaged if the level of protection given to their data does not match their expectations. One step toward ensuring understanding between parties would be consistent use of clearly defined terminology used internationally, so that all those involved are clear on the level of identifiability of any particular set of data and, therefore, how that data can be accessed and shared.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a solution to preserve security and privacy in a healthcare environment where health-sensitive information will be accessed by many parties and stored in various distributed databases. The solution should maintain anonymous medical records and it should be able to link anonymous medical information in distributed databases into a single patient medical record with the patient identity. In this paper we present a protocol that can be used to authenticate and authorize patients to healthcare services without providing the patient identification. Healthcare service can identify the patient using separate temporary identities in each identification session and medical records are linked to these temporary identities. Temporary identities can be used to enable record linkage and reverse track real patient identity in critical medical situations. The proposed protocol provides main security and privacy services such as user anonymity, message privacy, message confidentiality, user authentication, user authorization and message replay attacks. The medical environment validates the patient at the healthcare service as a real and registered patient for the medical services. Using the proposed protocol, the patient anonymous medical records at different healthcare services can be linked into one single report and it is possible to securely reverse track anonymous patient into the real identity. The protocol protects the patient privacy with a secure anonymous authentication to healthcare services and medical record registries according to the European and the UK legislations, where the patient real identity is not disclosed with the distributed patient medical records.",

    "abstract": "Medical data are often maintained by different organizations. However, detailed analyses sometimes require these datasets to be integrated without violating patient or commercial privacy. Multiparty Private Set Intersection (MPSI), which is an important privacy-preserving protocol, computes an intersection of multiple private datasets. This approach ensures that only designated parties can identify the intersection. In this paper, we propose a practical MPSI that satisfies the following requirements: The size of the datasets maintained by the different parties is independent of the others, and the computational complexity of the dataset held by each party is independent of the number of parties. Our MPSI is based on the use of an outsourcing provider, who has no knowledge of the data inputs or outputs. This reduces the computational complexity. The performance of the proposed MPSI is evaluated by implementing a prototype on a virtual private network to enable parallel computation in multiple threads. Our protocol is confirmed to be more efficient than comparable existing approaches.",

The preservation of security of health-related information can only be achieved through a concerted approach, comprising legal, organisational, technical and educational actions. These classes of actions constitute a complete \"security framework\", a key aspect of which is the set of rules, laws and regulations that govern the usage of information within a Health Care Establishment. This set is commonly referred to as \"Security Policy\". In this paper, the SEISMED High Level Security Policy for Health Care Establishments is presented.",

    "title": "Assessment of Employee Susceptibility to Phishing Attacks at US Health Care Institutions.",
    "abstract": "Cybersecurity is an increasingly important threat to health care delivery, and email phishing is a major attack vector against hospital employees. To describe the practice of phishing simulation and the extent to which health care employees are vulnerable to phishing simulations. Retrospective, multicenter quality improvement study of a convenience sample of 6 geographically dispersed US health care institutions that ran phishing simulations from August 1, 2011, through April 10, 2018. The specific institutions are anonymized herein for security and privacy concerns. Simulated phishing emails received by employees at US health care institutions. Date of phishing campaign, campaign number, number of emails sent, number of emails clicked, and email content. Emails were classified into 3 categories (office related, personal, or information technology related). The final study sample included 6 anonymized US health care institutions, 95 simulated phishing campaigns, and 2 971 945 emails, 422 062 of which were clicked (14.2%). The median institutional click rates for campaigns ranged from 7.4% (interquartile range [IQR], 5.8%-9.6%) to 30.7% (IQR, 25.2%-34.4%), with an overall median click rate of 16.7% (IQR, 8.3%-24.2%) across all campaigns and institutions. In the regression model, repeated phishing campaigns were associated with decreased odds of clicking on a subsequent phishing email (adjusted OR, 0.511; 95% CI, 0.382-0.685 for 6-10 campaigns; adjusted OR, 0.335; 95% CI, 0.282-0.398 for >10 campaigns). Among a sample of US health care institutions that sent phishing simulations, almost 1 in 7 simulated emails sent were clicked on by employees. Increasing campaigns were associated with decreased odds of clicking on a phishing email, suggesting a potential benefit of phishing simulation and awareness. With cyberattacks increasing against US health care systems, these click rates represent a major cybersecurity risk for hospitals.",

    "title": "A Lightweight Hybrid Deep Learning Privacy Preserving Model for FC-Based Industrial Internet of Medical Things.",
    "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gaining importance as most technologies and applications are integrated with the IIoT. Moreover, it consists of several tiny sensors to sense the environment and gather the information. These devices continuously monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and transfer the captured data to nearby devices or servers using an open channel, i.e., internet. However, such centralized system based on IIoT provides more vulnerabilities to security and privacy in IIoT networks. In order to resolve these issues, we present a blockchain-based deep-learning framework that provides two levels of security and privacy. First a blockchain scheme is designed where each participating entities are registered, verified, and thereafter validated using smart contract based enhanced Proof of Work, to achieve the target of security and privacy. Second, a deep-learning scheme with a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) technique for privacy and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for intrusion detection is designed. The experimental results are based on the IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets that are publicly available. The proposed simulations results are compared with the benchmark models and it is validated that the proposed framework outperforms the existing system.",

We consider the intra-VPN and inter-VPN communications which correspond to two different cases: VPN communication among ONUs in one group and in different groups. The proposed scheme can provide the enhanced security and a more flexible configuration for VPN users compared to the VPN in WDM-PON or TDM-PON systems. The all-optical VPN and inter-ONU communications at 10-Gbit/s with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM) for the proposed optical OFDM-PON system are demonstrated.

Researchers widely use it to develop decentralized IdM systems for the Health Internet of Things (HIoT). HIoT is considered a vulnerable system that produces and processes sensitive data. BC-based IdM systems have the potential to be more secure and privacy-aware than centralized IdM systems. However, many studies have shown potential security risks to using BC. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted by the authors on BC-based IdM systems in HIoT systems showed a lack of comprehensive security and risk management frameworks for BC-based IdM systems in HIoT. Conducting a further SLR focusing on risk management and supplemented by Grey Literature (GL), in this paper, a security taxonomy, security framework, and cybersecurity risk management framework for the HIoT BC-IdM systems are identified and proposed. The cybersecurity risk management framework will significantly assist developers, researchers, and organizations in developing a secure BC-based IdM to ensure HIoT users' data privacy and security.",

    "abstract": "Due to recent advancements and appealing applications, the purchase rate of smart devices is increasing at a higher rate. Parallely, the security related threats and attacks are also increasing at a greater ratio on these devices. As a result, a considerable number of attacks have been noted in the recent past. To resist these attacks, many password-based authentication schemes are proposed. However, most of these schemes are not screen size independent; whereas, smart devices come in different sizes. Specifically, they are not suitable for miniature smart devices due to the small screen size and/or lack of full sized keyboards. In this paper, we propose a new screen size independent password-based authentication scheme, which also offers an affordable defense against shoulder surfing, brute force, and smudge attacks. In the proposed scheme, the Press Touch (PT)-a.k.a., Force Touch in Apple's MacBook, Apple Watch, ZTE's Axon 7 phone; 3D Touch in iPhone 6 and 7; and so on-is transformed into a new type of code, named Press Touch Code (PTC). We design and implement three variants of it, namely mono-PTC, multi-PTC, and multi-PTC with Grid, on the Android Operating System. An in-lab experiment and a comprehensive survey have been conducted on 105 participants to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high amount of electronic health records, hospitals have prioritized data protection. Because it uses parallel computing and is distributed, the security of the cloud cannot be guaranteed. Because of the large number of e-health records, hospitals have made data security a major concern. The cloud's security cannot be guaranteed because it uses parallel processing and is distributed. The blockchain (BC) has been deployed in the cloud to preserve and secure medical data because it is particularly prone to security breaches and attacks such as forgery, manipulation, and privacy leaks. An overview of blockchain (BC) technology in cloud storage to improve healthcare system security can be obtained by reading this paper. First, we will look at the benefits and drawbacks of using a basic cloud storage system. After that, a brief overview of blockchain cloud storage technology will be offered. Many researches have focused on using blockchain technology in healthcare systems as a possible solution to the security concerns in healthcare, resulting in tighter and more advanced security requirements being provided. This survey could lead to a blockchain-based solution for the protection of cloud-outsourced healthcare data. Evaluation and comparison of the simulation tests of the offered blockchain technology-focused studies can demonstrate integrity verification with cloud storage and medical data, data interchange with reduced computational complexity, security, and privacy protection. Because of blockchain and IT, business warfare has emerged, and governments in the Middle East have embraced it. Thus, this research focused on the qualities that influence customers' interest in and approval of blockchain technology in cloud storage for healthcare system security and the aspects that increase people's knowledge of blockchain. One way to better understand how people feel about learning how to use blockchain technology in healthcare is through the United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A snowball sampling method was used to select respondents in an online poll to gather data about blockchain technology in Middle Eastern poor countries. A total of 443 randomly selected responses were tested using SPSS. Blockchain adoption has been shown to be influenced by anticipation, effort expectancy, social influence (SI), facilitation factors, personal innovativeness (PInn), and a perception of security risk (PSR). Blockchain adoption and acceptance were found to be influenced by anticipation, effort expectancy, social influence (SI), facilitating conditions, personal innovativeness (PInn), and perceived security risk (PSR) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as providing an overview of current trends in the field and issues pertaining to significance and compatibility.",

    "abstract": "Data breach costs in the United States are among the highest in the world, making robust cybersecurity an important bulwark of national defense. Healthcare is a popular target for cyber threats, and there is increasing emphasis on cybersecurity safeguards to protect sensitive patient data. The objective of this national survey and scoping review is to (1) identify cybersecurity awareness, preparedness, and practices among plastic surgeons, and (2) to provide guidelines to mitigate the threat of cyberattacks. A 16-question, anonymous online survey was developed and distributed to The Aesthetic Society registrants to ascertain plastic surgeons' cybersecurity practices. Utilizing PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases, eligible articles were identified as part of this scoping review. Of 89 individuals who began the survey, 69 completed it (77.5%). Sixty respondents agreed or strongly agreed that cybersecurity is an important issue in plastic surgery. The greatest perceived limitations for protection against cyberattacks were insufficient expertise (41.7%), followed by lack of funding and insufficient time to dedicate to this goal. Most respondents (78.7%) had cybersecurity policies incorporated into their practice. Those who agreed or strongly agreed they had technology to prevent data theft/breach were significantly more likely to be older than 54 years of age (P < .001). No articles identified in the literature specifically addressed cybersecurity in plastic surgery; however, 12 articles detailing cybersecurity in healthcare were identified and included. Despite possessing adequate technology and procedures in place to prevent cyberattacks, plastic surgeons perceive significant barriers to cybersecurity protection, including insufficient expertise and lack of dedicated funding. It is imperative that our field establishes standards and protocols to protect our patients.",

In this research, we reduced the computational cost of the TEA hash function and investigated the influence of the quality of the random numbers generated on the results of DPD calculations. It has already been established that the randomness, or quality, of the random numbers depend on the number of processes from internal functions such as SHIFT, XOR and ADD, which are commonly referred to as \"rounds\". Surprisingly, if we choose seed numbers from high entropy sources, with a minimum number of rounds, the quality of the random numbers generated is sufficient to successfully perform accurate DPD simulations. Although it is well known that using a minimal number of rounds is insufficient for generating high-quality random numbers, the combination of selecting good seed numbers and the robustness of DPD simulations means that we can reduce the random number generation cost without reducing the accuracy of the simulation results.",

The healthcare industry has been put to the test with the federally mandated Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. To assess the compliance status of HIPAA security standards, a random sample of 1,000 U.S. hospitals was surveyed in January 2004, yielding a return rate of 29 percent. One year later, a follow-up survey was sent to all previous respondents, with 50 percent replying. HIPAA officers'perceptions of security compliance in 2004 and 2005 are compared in this article. The security standards achieving the highest level of compliance in both 2004 and 2005 were obtaining required business associate agreements and physical safeguards to limit access to electronic information systems. Respondents indicated least compliance both years in performing periodic evaluation of security practices governed by the Security Rule. Roadblocks, threats, problems and solutions regarding HIPAA compliance are discussed. This information may be applied to current and future strategies toward maintaining security of information systems throughout the healthcare industry.",

    "abstract": "To foster the development of a privacy-protective, sustainable cross-border information system in the framework of a European public health project. A targeted privacy impact assessment was implemented to identify the best architecture for a European information system for diabetes directly tapping into clinical registries. Four steps were used to provide input to software designers and developers: a structured literature search, analysis of data flow scenarios or options, creation of an ad hoc questionnaire and conduction of a Delphi procedure. The literature search identified a core set of relevant papers on privacy (n = 11). Technicians envisaged three candidate system architectures, with associated data flows, to source an information flow questionnaire that was submitted to the Delphi panel for the selection of the best architecture. A detailed scheme envisaging an \"aggregation by group of patients\" was finally chosen, based upon the exchange of finely tuned summary tables. Public health information systems should be carefully engineered only after a clear strategy for privacy protection has been planned, to avoid breaching current regulations and future concerns and to optimise the development of statistical routines. The BIRO (Best Information Through Regional Outcomes) project delivers a specific method of privacy impact assessment that can be conveniently used in similar situations across Europe.",

It first maps out three overlapping frameworks on genomic data and analyzes their underpinning policy goals. Subsequent sections examine the regulatory approaches with respect to five aspects of responsible use and sharing of genomic data, namely, consent, privacy, security, compatible processing, and oversight. It argues that substantial centralised control exerted by the state is, and would probably remain, the dominant feature of genomic data governance in China, though concerns of individual protection are gaining momentum. Rather than revolving around a simplistic antinomy between privacy preservation and open science, the regulatory landscape is mainly shaped by the tension between government desires for national security, state competitiveness, and public health benefits.",

To prevent data bias, the datasets need to be compiled carefully and to be representative of the target population. Accordingly, the upcoming European Union AI act sets particularly high requirements for the datasets used in training medical AI systems. Cognitive bias occurs when radiologists place too much trust in the results provided by AI systems (overreliance). So far, diagnostic AI systems are used almost exclusively as \"second look\" systems. If diagnostic AI systems are to be used in the future as \"first look\" systems or even as autonomous AI systems in order to enhance efficiency in radiology, the question of liability needs to be addressed, comparable to liability for autonomous driving. Such use of AI would also significantly change the role of radiologists.",

    "title": "The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on health research.",
    "abstract": "On the May 25, 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (hereafter the GDPR or the Regulation) came into force, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (upon which the Data Protection Act 1998 is based), and imposing new responsibilities on organizations which process the data of European Union citizens. This piece examines the impact of the Regulation on health research. The Regulation seeks to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizen's data privacy and to reshape the way that organizations approach data privacy (See the GDPR portal at: https://www.eugdpr.org/ (accessed 8 May 2018). As a Regulation the GDPR is directly applicable in all member states as opposed to a directive which requires national implementing measures (In the UK the Data Protection Act 1998 was the implementing legislation for the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.). The Regulation is sector wide, but its impact on organizations us sector specific. In some sectors, the Regulation inhibits the processing of personal data, whilst in others it enables that processing. The Regulation takes the position that the 'processing of data should be designed to serve mankind' (Recital 4). Whilst it does not spell out what exactly is meant by this, it indicates that a proportionate approach will be taken to the protection of personal data, where that data can be processed for common goods such as healthcare. Thus, the protection of personal data is not absolute, but considered in relation to its function in society and balance with other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality (Recital 4). Differing interpretations of proportionality can detract from the harmonization objective of the Regulation. Reflecting the commitment to proportionality, scientific research holds a privileged position in the Regulation. Throughout the Regulation provision is made for organizations that process personal data for scientific research purposes to avoid restrictive measures which might impede the increase of knowledge. However, the application of the Regulation differs across health research sectors and across jurisdictions. Transparency and engagement across the health research sector is required to promote alignment. Research which focuses on the particular problems which arise in the context of the regulation's application to health research would be welcome. Particularly in the context of the operation of the Regulation alongside the duty of confidentiality and the variation in approaches across Member States.",

    "title": "Dual-hybrid intrusion detection system to detect False Data Injection in smart grids.",
    "abstract": "Modernizing power systems into smart grids has introduced numerous benefits, including enhanced efficiency, reliability, and integration of renewable energy sources. However, this advancement has also increased vulnerability to cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in identifying sophisticated FDIAs due to their reliance on predefined rules and signatures. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel IDS that utilizes hybrid feature selection and deep learning classifiers to detect FDIAs in smart grids. The main objective is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of IDS in smart grids. The proposed methodology combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for hybrid feature selection, ensuring the selection of the most relevant features for detecting FDIAs. Additionally, the IDS employs a hybrid deep learning classifier that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the smart grid data's spatial and temporal features. The dataset used for evaluation, the Industrial Control System (ICS) Cyber Attack Dataset (Power System Dataset) consists of various FDIA scenarios simulated in a smart grid environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS framework significantly outperforms traditional methods. The hybrid feature selection effectively reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, improving computational efficiency and detection performance. The hybrid deep learning classifier performs better in key metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. Precisely, the proposed approach attains higher accuracy by accurately identifying true positives and minimizing false negatives, ensuring the reliable operation of smart grids. Recall is enhanced by capturing critical features relevant to all attack types, while precision is improved by reducing false positives, leading to fewer unnecessary interventions. The F-measure balances recall and precision, indicating a robust and reliable detection system. This study presents a practical dual-hybrid IDS framework for detecting FDIAs in smart grids, addressing the limitations of existing IDS techniques. Future research should focus on integrating real-world smart grid data for validation, developing adaptive learning mechanisms, exploring other bio-inspired optimization algorithms, and addressing real-time processing and scalability challenges in large-scale deployments.",

No undesired information disclosure, post-processing of the POMs or digital inverse computation appears in our proposed method. In order to achieve the reduction in key transmission, a modified image hiding method based on the modified phase retrieval algorithm and logistic map is further proposed in this paper, in which the fractional orders and the parameters with respect to the logistic map are regarded as encryption keys.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of intelligent vehicles(IVs) development has resulted in a complex network. As the number of IVs in a network increases, so does the number of connections. As a result, a great deal of data is generated. This complexity leads to insecure communication, traffic congestion, security, and privacy issues in vehicular networks (VNs). In addition, detecting malicious IVs, data integration, and data validation are major issues in VNs that affect network performance. A blockchain-based model for secure communication and malicious IV detection is proposed to address the above issues. In addition, this system also addresses data integration and transaction validation using an encryption scheme for secure communication. A multi-chain concept separates the legitimate and malicious data into two chains: the Integrity chain (I-chain) and Fraud chain (F-chain). This multi-chain mechanism solves the storage problem and reduces the computing power. The integration of blockchain in the proposed model provides privacy, network security, transparency, and immutability. To address the storage issue, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is integrated with Certificate Authority (CA). A reputation mechanism is introduced to detect malicious IVs in the network based on ratings. This reputation mechanism is also used to prevent Sybil attack. The evaluation of the proposed work is based on the cost of smart contracts and computation time. Furthermore, two attacker models are presented to prevent the selfish mining attack and the Sybil attack. Finally, a security analysis of the proposed smart contracts with their security vulnerabilities is also presented.",

    "title": "Parallel point-multiplication architecture using combined group operations for high-speed cryptographic applications.",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel parallel architecture for fast hardware implementation of elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM), which is the key operation of an elliptic curve cryptography processor. The point multiplication over binary fields is synthesized on both FPGA and ASIC technology by designing fast elliptic curve group operations in Jacobian projective coordinates. A novel combined point doubling and point addition (PDPA) architecture is proposed for group operations to achieve high speed and low hardware requirements for ECPM. It has been implemented over the binary field which is recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The proposed ECPM supports two Koblitz and random curves for the key sizes 233 and 163 bits. For group operations, a finite-field arithmetic operation, e.g. multiplication, is designed on a polynomial basis. The delay of a 233-bit point multiplication is only 3.05 and 3.56 μs, in a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA, for Koblitz and random curves, respectively, and 0.81 μs in an ASIC 65-nm technology, which are the fastest hardware implementation results reported in the literature to date. In addition, a 163-bit point multiplication is also implemented in FPGA and ASIC for fair comparison which takes around 0.33 and 0.46 μs, respectively. The area-time product of the proposed point multiplication is very low compared to similar designs. The performance ([Formula: see text]) and Area × Time × Energy (ATE) product of the proposed design are far better than the most significant studies found in the literature.",

    "title": "A novel and lightweight system to secure wireless medical sensor networks.",
    "abstract": "Wireless medical sensor networks (MSNs) are a key enabling technology in e-healthcare that allows the data of a patient's vital body parameters to be collected by the wearable or implantable biosensors. However, the security and privacy protection of the collected data is a major unsolved issue, with challenges coming from the stringent resource constraints of MSN devices, and the high demand for both security/privacy and practicality. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure system for MSNs. The system employs hash-chain based key updating mechanism and proxy-protected signature technique to achieve efficient secure transmission and fine-grained data access control. Furthermore, we extend the system to provide backward secrecy and privacy preservation. Our system only requires symmetric-key encryption/decryption and hash operations and is thus suitable for the low-power sensor nodes. This paper also reports the experimental results of the proposed system in a network of resource-limited motes and laptop PCs, which show its efficiency in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first secure data transmission and access control system for MSNs until now.",

    "title": "Exploration of Reproductive Health Apps' Data Privacy Policies and the Risks Posed to Users: Qualitative Content Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Mobile health apps often require the collection of identifiable information. Subsequently, this places users at significant risk of privacy breaches when the data are misused or not adequately stored and secured. These issues are especially concerning for users of reproductive health apps in the United States as protection of sensitive user information is affected by shifting governmental regulations such as the overruling of Roe v Wade and varying state-level abortion laws. Limited studies have analyzed the data privacy policies of these apps and considered the safety issues associated with a lack of user transparency and protection. This study aimed to evaluate popular reproductive health apps, assess their individual privacy policies, analyze federal and state data privacy laws governing these apps in the United States and the European Union (EU), and recommend best practices for users and app developers to ensure user data safety. In total, 4 popular reproductive health apps-Clue, Flo, Period Tracker by GP Apps, and Stardust-as identified from multiple web sources were selected through convenience sampling. This selection ensured equal representation of apps based in the United States and the EU, facilitating a comparative analysis of data safety practices under differing privacy laws. A qualitative content analysis of the apps and a review of the literature on data use policies, governmental data privacy regulations, and best practices for mobile app data privacy were conducted between January 2023 and July 2023. The apps were downloaded and systematically evaluated using the Transparency, Health Content, Excellent Technical Content, Security/Privacy, Usability, Subjective (THESIS) evaluation tool to assess their privacy and security practices. The overall privacy and security scores for the EU-based apps, Clue and Flo, were both 3.5 of 5. In contrast, the US-based apps, Period Tracker by GP Apps and Stardust, received scores of 2 and 4.5, respectively. Major concerns regarding privacy and data security primarily involved the apps' use of IP address tracking and the involvement of third parties for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as the potential misuse of data. Currently, user expectations for data privacy in reproductive health apps are not being met. Despite stricter privacy policies, particularly with state-specific adaptations, apps must be transparent about data storage and third-party sharing even if just for marketing or analytical purposes. Given the sensitivity of reproductive health data and recent state restrictions on abortion, apps should minimize data collection, exceed encryption and anonymization standards, and reduce IP address tracking to better protect users.",

    "title": "Controlled bidirectional quantum secure direct communication.",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel protocol for controlled bidirectional quantum secure communication based on a nonlocal swap gate scheme. Our proposed protocol would be applied to a system in which a controller (supervisor/Charlie) controls the bidirectional communication with quantum information or secret messages between legitimate users (Alice and Bob). In this system, the legitimate users must obtain permission from the controller in order to exchange their respective quantum information or secret messages simultaneously; the controller is unable to obtain any quantum information or secret messages from the decoding process. Moreover, the presence of the controller also avoids the problem of one legitimate user receiving the quantum information or secret message before the other, and then refusing to help the other user decode the quantum information or secret message. Our proposed protocol is aimed at protecting against external and participant attacks on such a system, and the cost of transmitting quantum bits using our protocol is less than that achieved in other studies. Based on the nonlocal swap gate scheme, the legitimate users exchange their quantum information or secret messages without transmission in a public channel, thus protecting against eavesdroppers stealing the secret messages.",

    "title": "Hospital cybersecurity: Emergency planning response and preparedness to mitigate the effects of a potential cyberattack on French hospitals in Paris, France.",
    "abstract": "Over the last few years, numerous hospitals in France have been subject to increasingly frequent and severe cyberattacks that have disrupted healthcare provision to varying degrees. To mitigate this threat, especially in light of the forthcoming 2024 Olympic Games, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris in Paris has been developing contingency plans that have been tested in simulated exercises called CRYPTolocker EXercice since May 2021. The latest simulated ransomware cyberattack that involved more than 200 participants took place on July 5, 2023, and lasted for 24 hours. Although cybersecurity contingency plans are confidential for obvious reasons, this article presents the multidisciplinary organization of the simulated attack based on previous experiences from other hospitals and general findings that are in the public domain. It was found that the procedures in place worked well overall, and countermeasures were quickly implemented to limit the severity of this simulated cyberattack. However, failings were observed in intra- and extra-hospital communication, and conflicting priorities between different categories of personnel (administrative, managerial, and clinical) hampered the information technology team in resolving various issues. Furthermore, it was found that mental fatigue, task saturation, and information overload may have overwhelmed senior managers at sporadic intervals. This often resulted in an action-reaction approach being used to find temporary solutions to immediate problems. Consequently, senior managers who participated in this simulated cyberattack were unable to think strategically and anticipate demands for middle- and long-term issues. This unprecedented exercise was an important learning experience for all participants, and the lessons learned will help further improve contingency planning and cyber resilience. It advised that all hospitals worldwide adopt and develop a similar multidisciplinary approach (taking into account their local contexts) to limit the deleterious effects of a potential cyberattack that undoubtedly will become more prevalent in the future.",

Several research works in the computer security field have identified serious security and privacy risks in IMDs that could compromise the implant and even the health of the patient who carries it. This article surveys the main security goals for the next generation of IMDs and analyzes the most relevant protection mechanisms proposed so far. On the one hand, the security proposals must have into consideration the inherent constraints of these small and implanted devices: energy, storage and computing power. On the other hand, proposed solutions must achieve an adequate balance between the safety of the patient and the security level offered, with the battery lifetime being another critical parameter in the design phase.",

    "abstract": "User authentication plays an important role to protect resources or services from being accessed by unauthorized users. In a recent paper, Das et al. proposed a secure and efficient uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. This scheme uses three factors, e.g. biometrics, password, and smart card, to protect the security. It protects user privacy and is believed to have many abilities to resist a range of network attacks, even if the secret information stored in the smart card is compromised. In this paper, we analyze the security of Das et al.'s scheme, and show that the scheme is in fact insecure against the replay attack, user impersonation attacks and off-line guessing attacks. Then, we also propose a robust uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. Compared with the existing schemes, our protocol uses a different user authentication mechanism to resist replay attack. We show that our proposed scheme can provide stronger security than previous protocols. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme through the BAN (Burrows, Abadi, and Needham) logic.",

    "abstract": "Model Inversion Attack reconstructs confidential training dataset from a target deep learning model. Most of the existing methods assume the adversary has an auxiliary dataset that has similar distribution with the private dataset. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios. Since the private dataset is unknown, the domain divergence between the auxiliary dataset and the private dataset is inevitable. In this paper, we use Cross Domain Model Inversion Attack to represent the distribution divergence scenario in MIA. With the distribution divergence between the private images and auxiliary images, the distribution between the feature vectors of the private images and those of the auxiliary images is also different. Moreover, the outputted prediction vectors of the auxiliary images are also misclassified. The inversion attack is thus hard to be performed. We perform both the feature vector inversion task and prediction vector inversion task in this cross domain setting. For feature vector inversion, Domain Alignment MIA (DA-MIA) is proposed. While performing the reconstruction task, DA-MIA aligns the feature vectors of auxiliary images with the feature vectors of private images in an adversarial manner to mitigate the domain divergence between them. Thus, semantically meaningful images can be reconstructed. For prediction vector inversion, we further introduce an auxiliary classifier and propose Domain Alignment MIA with Auxiliary Classifier (DA-MIA-AC). The auxiliary classifier is pretrained by the auxiliary dataset and fine-tuned during the adversarial training stage. Thus, the misclassification problem caused by domain divergence can be solved, and the images can be reconstructed correctly. Various experiments are performed to show the advancement of our methods, the results show that DA-MIA can improve the SSIM score of the reconstructed images for up to 191%, DA-MIA-AC can increase the classification accuracy score of the reconstructed images from 9.18% to 81.32% in Cross Domain Model Inversion Attack.",

Principles derived from ten identified sources were compared with each of the compiled principles to assess support level, uniformity, and inconsistencies. Of 28 compiled principles, 23 were supported by at least 50 percent of the sources. Technology could address at least 12 of the principles. Notable consistencies among the principles could provide a basis for consensus for further legislative and organizational work.

    "abstract": "The operation of cyber infrastructures relies on both cyber and physical components, which are subject to incidental and intentional degradations of different kinds. Within the context of network and computing infrastructures, we study the strategic interactions between an attacker and a defender using game-theoretic models that take into account both cyber and physical components. The attacker and defender optimize their individual utilities, expressed as sums of cost and system terms. First, we consider a Boolean attack-defense model, wherein the cyber and physical subinfrastructures may be attacked and reinforced as individual units. Second, we consider a component attack-defense model wherein their components may be attacked and defended, and the infrastructure requires minimum numbers of both to function. We show that the Nash equilibrium under uniform costs in both cases is computable in polynomial time, and it provides high-level deterministic conditions for the infrastructure survival. When probabilities of successful attack and defense, and of incidental failures, are incorporated into the models, the results favor the attacker but otherwise remain qualitatively similar. This approach has been motivated and validated by our experiences with UltraScience Net infrastructure, which was built to support high-performance network experiments. The analytical results, however, are more general, and we apply them to simplified models of cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures.",

As the dramatic increase of users and network capacity, the issue of physical-layer security becomes more and more important. This paper proposes a physical-enhanced secure strategy for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-PON) by employing frequency domain chaos scrambling. The Logistic map is adopted for the chaos mapping. The chaos scrambling strategy can dynamically allocate the scrambling matrices for different OFDM frames according to the initial condition, which enhance the confidentiality of the physical layer. A mathematical model of this secure system is derived firstly, which achieves a secure transmission at physical layer in OFDM-PON. The results from experimental implementation using Logistic mapped chaos scrambling are also given to further demonstrate the efficiency of this secure strategy. An 10.125 Gb/s 64QAM-OFDM data with Logistic mapped chaos scrambling are successfully transmitted over 25-km single mode fiber (SMF), and the experimental results show that proposed security scheme can protect the system from eavesdropper and attacker, while keep a good performance for the legal ONU.",

Technically, blockchain has some limitations in solving vaccine and other supply chain problems, such as large on-chain storage consumption and low throughput. To better alleviate these restrictions, we propose an improved, blockchain-based, storage-efficient vaccine safety protection scheme in this work. Specifically, we first model the vaccine circulation process. We then design a system to protect vaccine circulation using blockchain, cloud, and cryptographic mechanisms. The proposed system leverages the cloud to implement the vaccine circulation model. Correspondingly, it uses the blockchain to store circulating data certificates and signatures. We evaluated the proposed conceptual model using a consortium blockchain. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient.",

    "abstract": "Adding the adequate level of security of information systems dealing with sensitive data, privacy, or defense systems involves some form of access control. The audits performed are dealing with the determination of the allowed activities of the legal users, when attempting to access resources of the system. Usually, full access is provided after the user has been successfully authenticated through an authentication mechanism (e.g., password), while the corresponding authorization control is based on the confidentiality level of the respective resources and the authorization level assigned to each user. A very important diversification occurring in modern digital technologies is related to the identification based on blockchain technology, which is presented as a public, distributed data series, unable to modify its history and grouped in time-numbered blocks. In this work, a blockchain-based verifiable user data access control policy for secured cloud data storage is suggested for a version associated with big data in health care. It is an innovative system of applying classified access policies to secure resources in the cloud, which operates based on blockchain technology. System evaluation is carried out by studying a case in its resilience to Eclipse attack under different malicious user capabilities for routing table poisoning.",

    "abstract": "Brazil was one of the largest cocoa producers in the world, mainly supported by the South of Bahia region. After the 1980s, the witch-broom disease demolished plantations, and farmers were forced into bankruptcy. The worldwide search for gourmet cocoa has rekindled interest in this production, whose fermentation process is a key step in obtaining fine cocoa, thanks to the fact that many processing properties and sensory attributes are developed in this phase. This article presents a blockchain-IoT-based system for the control and monitoring of these events, aiming to catalog in smart contracts valuable information for improvement of the cocoa fermentation process, and future research. Blockchain is used as a distributed database that implements an application-level security layer. A proof of concept was modeled and the performance of the emulated system was evaluated in the OMNet simulator, where a technique based on the SNMP protocol was applied to reduce the amount of data exchanged and resources served/consumed in this representation. Then, a physical platform was developed and preliminary experiments were performed on a real farm, as a way to verify the improvement of the cocoa fermentation process when using a technological approach.",

    "title": "To Infinity and Beyond: The Past, Present, and Future of Tele-Anesthesia.",
    "abstract": "Because the scope of anesthesia practice continues to expand, especially within the perioperative domain, our specialty must continually examine technological services that allow us to provide care in innovative ways. Telemedicine has facilitated the remote provision of medical services across many different specialties, but it remains somewhat unclear whether the use of telemedicine would fit within the practice of anesthesiology on a consistent basis. There have been several reports on the successful use of telemedicine within the preoperative and intraoperative realm. However, patient selection, patient and provider satisfaction, case cancellation rates, equipment reliability, and security of protected health information are just some of the issues that require further examination. This article seeks to review comprehensively the available literature related to the use of telemedicine within the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of anesthetic care as well as analyze the major hurdles often encountered when implementing a teleconsultation service. Security of connection, data storage and encryption, federal and state medical licensure compliance, as well as overall cost/savings analysis are a few of the issues that warrant further exploration and research. As telemedicine programs develop within the perioperative arena, it is imperative for institutions to share knowledge, successes, and pitfalls to improve the delivery of care in today's technology-driven medical landscape.",

    "title": "Exploring data security risks associated with trauma medical data within hospitals in China: a qualitative study.",
    "abstract": "To explore data security risks associated with trauma medical data within hospitals in China, identify and explore the potential underlying factors contributing to these risks and collect suggestions from different stakeholders. This is a qualitative study involving two types of hospital personnel. Data analysis was performed using thematic analysis. The study was conducted in 21 tertiary hospitals from 12 provinces in China, distributed across the eastern, central and western regions of the country. The interviews were conducted between April and August 2022. A total of 27 respondents (7 department heads and 20 doctors) were interviewed through stratified purposive sampling. Data security risks associated with trauma medical data might arise from trauma physicians' inadequate management of trauma data, the absence of trauma data administrators and data management systems and the lack of security measures for trauma databases. Feasible suggestions included training trauma physicians, establishing a trauma data administrator and a trauma data management system and improving basic data security protection measures. Determining the risks of trauma medical data security and providing tailored suggestions contribute to the development of healthcare data governance in China. This research establishes a foundation for addressing the current risks related to trauma medical data security and could contribute to efforts to improve the overall capacity of trauma data management in China.",

    "title": "Individual privacy versus public good: protecting confidentiality in health research.",
    "abstract": "Health and medical data are increasingly being generated, collected, and stored in electronic form in healthcare facilities and administrative agencies. Such data hold a wealth of information vital to effective health policy development and evaluation, as well as to enhanced clinical care through evidence-based practice and safety and quality monitoring. These initiatives are aimed at improving individuals' health and well-being. Nevertheless, analyses of health data archives must be conducted in such a way that individuals' privacy is not compromised. One important aspect of protecting individuals' privacy is protecting the confidentiality of their data. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a review of a number of approaches to reducing disclosure risk when making data available for research, and to present a taxonomy for such approaches. Some of these methods are widely used, whereas others are still in development. It is important to have a range of methods available because there is also a range of data-use scenarios, and it is important to be able to choose between methods suited to differing scenarios. In practice, it is necessary to find a balance between allowing the use of health and medical data for research and protecting confidentiality. This balance is often presented as a trade-off between disclosure risk and data utility, because methods that reduce disclosure risk, in general, also reduce data utility.",

Blockchain technology is being implemented in dental care systems to store and share medical information, improve insurance claims, and provide innovative dental data ledgers. Because the healthcare sector is a large and ever-growing industry, the use of blockchain technology would have many benefits. To improve dental care delivery, researchers advocate using blockchain technology and smart contracts due to their numerous advantages. In this research, we concentrate on blockchain-based dental care systems. In particular, we examine the current research literature, pinpoint issues with existing dental care systems, and consider how blockchain technology may be used to address these issues. Finally, the limitations of the proposed blockchain-based dental care systems are discussed which may be regarded as open issues.",

    "title": "Taxonomic insights into ethereum smart contracts by linking application categories to security vulnerabilities.",
    "abstract": "The expansion of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain has created a diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications. This growth, however, poses challenges in classifying and securing these contracts. Existing research often separately addresses either classification or vulnerability detection, without a comprehensive analysis of how contract types are related to security risks. Our study addresses this gap by developing a taxonomy of smart contracts and examining the potential vulnerabilities associated with each category. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to analyze a dataset of over 100,040 Ethereum smart contracts, which is notably larger than those used in previous studies. Our analysis categorizes these contracts into eleven groups, with five primary categories: Notary, Token, Game, Financial, and Blockchain interaction. This categorization sheds light on the various functions and applications of smart contracts in today's blockchain environment. In response to the growing need for better security in smart contract development, we also investigate the link between these categories and common vulnerabilities. Our results identify specific vulnerabilities associated with different contract types, providing valuable insights for developers and auditors. This relationship between contract categories and vulnerabilities is a new contribution to the field, as it has not been thoroughly explored in previous research. Our findings offer a detailed taxonomy of smart contracts and practical recommendations for enhancing security. By understanding how contract categories correlate with vulnerabilities, developers can implement more effective security measures, and auditors can better prioritize their reviews. This study advances both academic knowledge of smart contracts and practical strategies for securing decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Awasthi and Srivastava proposed a novel biometric remote user authentication scheme for the telecare medicine information system (TMIS) with nonce. Their scheme is very efficient as it is based on efficient chaotic one-way hash function and bitwise XOR operations. In this paper, we first analyze Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme and then show that their scheme has several drawbacks: (1) incorrect password change phase, (2) fails to preserve user anonymity property, (3) fails to establish a secret session key beween a legal user and the server, (4) fails to protect strong replay attack, and (5) lacks rigorous formal security analysis. We then a propose a novel and secure biometric-based remote user authentication scheme in order to withstand the security flaw found in Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme and enhance the features required for an idle user authentication scheme. Through the rigorous informal and formal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition, we simulate our scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks, including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Our scheme is also efficient as compared to Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme.",

    "title": "Blockchain Data Secure Transmission Method Based on Homomorphic Encryption.",
    "abstract": "To ensure the security of data transmission and recording in Internet environment monitoring systems, this paper proposes a study of a secure method of blockchain data transfer based on homomorphic encryption. Blockchain data transmission is realized through homomorphic encryption. Homomorphic encryption can not only encrypt the original data, but also ensure that the data result after decrypting the data is the same as the original data. The asymmetric encrypted public key is collected by Internet of things (IoT) equipment to realize the design of blockchain data secure transmission method based on homomorphic encryption. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the first transmission is as high as 88% when using the transmission method in this paper. After several experiments, the transmission accuracy is high by using the design method in this paper. In the last test, the transmission accuracy is still 88%, and the data transmission effect is relatively stable. At the same time, compared to the management method used in this article, the transfer method used in this paper is more reliable than the original transfer method and is not prone to data distortion. It can be seen that this method has high transmission accuracy and short transmission time, which effectively avoids the data tampering caused by too long time in the transmission process.",

While, as before, in principle patients' consent for the use of their personal data is still required, exemptions for medical research still exist. When all of the criteria for the exemptions are met, and the other requirements of the GDPR are adhered to, personal data can be used in medical research without consent. In this paper we present a brief outline of a number of GDPR-related requirements for use of personal data in medical research. Furthermore, we discuss how GDPR interlinks with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and in which areas GDPR remains subject to interpretation. Medical researchers using personal data need to be aware when consent is required and on which grounds personal data can be used without consent in the Netherlands.",

    "title": "Rules for processing genetic data for research purposes in view of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Genetic data contain sensitive health and non-health-related information about the individuals and their family members. Therefore, adopting adequate privacy safeguards is paramount when processing genetic data for research or clinical purposes. One of the major legal instruments for personal data protection in the EU is the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has entered into force in May 2016 and repealed the Directive 95/46/EC, with an ultimate goal of enhancing effectiveness and harmonization of personal data protection in the EU. This paper explores the major provisions of the new Regulation with regard to processing genetic data, and assesses the influence of such provisions on reinforcing the legal safeguards when sharing genetic data for research purposes. The new Regulation attempts to elucidate the scope of personal data, by recognizing pseudonymized data as personal (identifiable) data, and including genetic data in the catalog of special categories of data (sensitive data). Moreover, a set of new rules is laid out in the Regulation for processing personal data under the scientific research exemption. For instance, further use of genetic data for scientific research purposes, without obtaining additional consent will be allowed, if the specific conditions is met. The new Regulation has already fueled concerns among various stakeholders, owing to the challenges that may emerge when implementing the Regulation across the countries. Notably, the provided definition for pseudonymized data has been criticized because it leaves too much room for interpretations, and it might undermine the harmonization of the data protection across the countries.",

    "abstract": "The Internet has simplified daily life activities. However, besides its comfortability, the Internet also presents the risk of victimization by several kinds of crimes. The present article addresses the question of which factors influence cyber-dependent crime and how they vary between three kinds of cyber-dependent offences: malware infection, ransomware infection, and misuse of personal data. According to the Routine Activity Approach, it is assumed that crime is determined by a motivated offender, the behavior of the Internet user, and the existence of prevention factors. Our analyses were based on a random sample of 26,665 Internet users in two federal states in Germany, aged 16 years and older; 16.6 percent of the respondents had experienced at least one form of cyber-dependent victimization during the year 2014. The results indicate that individual and household factors, as well as online and prevention behavior, influence the risk of cyber-dependent victimization. Furthermore, the effects differ between the three types of offences. In conclusion, the risk of being victimized by cyber-dependent crime is not the same for anyone, but depends on multivariate factors according to the idea of Routine Activity Approach. However, in view of the fact that crime-related factors also matter, studying different cybercrime offences separately seems to be an appropriate research approach.",

Presently, the amalgamation of blockchain technology and the sixth-generation mobile communication network (6G) has garnered significant attention, as their fusion is poised to profoundly impact the digital economy and society at large. However, the convergence of blockchain and 6G networks poses challenges pertaining to security and performance. In this article, we propose an approach based on the design of secure mechanisms and performance optimization to delve into the key issues surrounding the integration of blockchain and 6G networks from both security and performance perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce the application scenarios of 6G networks and blockchain's empowerment of them to highlight the necessity of combining blockchain technology with 6G. Subsequently, in order to ensure the security of communication and data transmission between blockchain and 6G networks, we have investigated the design requirements for security mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss the efficient realization of the amalgamation between blockchain and 6G networks by proposing a solution based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for blockchain's asynchronous consensus protocol, alongside optimization strategies for storage and communication to meet the desired characteristics and requirements of 6G networks. Lastly, we provide valuable research directions that serve as references and guidance for the future development of the integration between blockchain and 6G networks.",

IT support responsibilities comprised the entire hospital, of which clinician eHealth security needs were only part. IT staff believed their support tasks were often fragmented while work responsibilities were hampered by resources shortages. They perceived clinicians as an ongoing security risk to private health information. By comparison clinicians believed IT staff would not adequately support the private and secure application of eHealth for patient care. Preliminary data analysis suggests the tension between these cohorts manifests as an eHealth environment where silos of clinical work are disconnected from silos of IT support work. The discipline-based silos hamper health privacy outcomes. Privacy and security policies, especially those influencing the audit process, will benefit by further research of this phenomenon.",

Both attacks are identified with the detectors operating without any special modifications, making this proposal well suited for real-world applications. The monitoring system is based on accumulating statistics of the times between consecutive detection events, and extracting the afterpulse and overall efficiency of the detectors in real-time using mathematical models fit to the measured data. We are able to directly observe changes in the afterpulse probabilities generated from the after-gate and faint after-gate attacks, as well as different timing signatures in the time-shift attack. We also discuss the applicability of our scheme to other general blinding attacks.",

However, many of them were found to have some design flaws. This paper concentrates on the security weaknesses of the three-factor authentication scheme by Mishra et al. After careful analysis, we find their scheme does not really resist replay attack while failing to provide an efficient password change phase. We further propose an improvement of Mishra et al.'s scheme with the purpose of preventing the security threats of their scheme. We demonstrate the proposed scheme is given to strong authentication against several attacks including attacks shown in the original scheme. In addition, we compare the performance and functionality with other multi-server authenticated key schemes.",

We designed a dual storage model of \"Blockchain+IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)\" to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain and realize efficient information queries. Additionally, we propose a data privacy protection solution based on some cryptographic primitives and the Merkle Tree that can avoid enterprise privacy and sensitive data leakage. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed system using the Ethereum blockchain platform and provided the cost, performance, and security analysis, as well as compared it with the existing solutions. The results showed that the proposed system is both efficient and feasible and can meet the practical application requirements.",

    "title": "LAN attack detection using Discrete Event Systems.",
    "abstract": "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for determining the link layer or Medium Access Control (MAC) address of a network host, given its Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address. ARP is a stateless protocol and any IP-MAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IP-MAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IP-MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IP-MAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IP-MAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IP-MAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed.",

Then, we analyze the coding performance of these two kinds of en/decoders by the calculation of autocorrelation and cross-correlation with sets of 31-chip, 63-chip and 127-chip Gold codes. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate the hybrid use of both en/decoders.

The first is the establishment of a dedicated Incident Reporting Scheme (IRS) for HCEs, enabling the level and types of security incidents faced within the healthcare community to be monitored and advice appropriately targeted. The second aspect presents a description of healthcare security World Wide Web service, which provides a comprehensive source of advice and guidance for establishments when trying to address and prevent IT security breaches.

    "title": "Game Theory-Based Authentication Framework to Secure Internet of Vehicles with Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a new paradigm for vehicular networks. Using diverse access methods, IoV enables vehicles to connect with their surroundings. However, without data security, IoV settings might be hazardous. Because of the IoV's openness and self-organization, they are prone to malevolent attack. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a revolutionary blockchain-enabled game theory-based authentication mechanism for securing IoVs. Here, a three layer multi-trusted authorization solution is provided in which authentication of vehicles can be performed from initial entry to movement into different trusted authorities' areas without any delay by the use of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in the beginning and later through duel gaming, and a dynamic Proof-of-Work (dPoW) consensus mechanism. Formal and informal security analyses justify the framework's credibility in more depth with mathematical proofs. A rigorous comparative study demonstrates that the suggested framework achieves greater security and functionality characteristics and provides lower transaction and computation overhead than many of the available solutions so far. However, these solutions never considered the prime concerns of physical cloning and side-channel attacks. However, the framework in this paper is capable of handling them along with all the other security attacks the previous work can handle. Finally, the suggested framework has been subjected to a blockchain implementation to demonstrate its efficacy with duel gaming to achieve authentication in addition to its capability of using lower burdened blockchain at the physical layer, which current blockchain-based authentication models for IoVs do not support.",

Through makers and do-it-yourself initiatives, 'hacking' is moving into the everyday life of citizens. This article explores the collective and political nature of those hacks by reporting on empirical work on electronic waste and do-it-yourself biology hacking. Using Dewey's experimental approach to politics, we analyse hacks as 'inquiry' to see how they serve to articulate public and political action. We argue that do-it-yourself and makers' hacks are technical and political demonstrations. What do-it-yourself and makers' hacks ultimately demonstrate is that things can be done otherwise and that 'you' can also do it. In this sense, they have a potential viral effect. The final part of the article explores some potential shortcomings of such politics of demonstration.",

    "title": "HCAP: Hybrid cyber attack prediction model for securing healthcare applications.",
    "abstract": "The rapid development and integration of interconnected healthcare devices and communication networks within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have significantly enhanced healthcare services. However, this growth has also introduced new vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of cybersecurity attacks. These attacks threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive healthcare data, raising concerns about the reliability of IoMT infrastructure. Addressing these challenges requires advanced cybersecurity measures to protect the dynamic IoMT ecosystem from evolving threats. This research focuses on enhancing cyberattack prediction and prevention in IoMT environments through innovative Machine-learning techniques to improve healthcare data security and resilience. However, the existing model's efficiency depends on the diversity of data, which leads to computational complexity issues. In addition, the conventional model faces overfitting issues in training data, which causes prediction inaccuracies. Thus, the research introduces the hybridized cyber attack prediction model (HCAP) and analyzes various IoMT data source information to address the limitations of dataset availability issues. The gathered information is processed with the help of Principal Component-Recursive Feature Elimination (PC-RFE), which eliminates the irrelevant features. The extracted features are fed into the lion-optimization technique to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the recurrent neural networks, enhancing the model's ability to efficiently predict cybersecurity threats with a maximum recognition rate in IoMT environments. The recurrent networks, specifically Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), process data from healthcare devices, identifying abnormal patterns that indicate potential cyberattacks over time. The created system was implemented using Python, and various metrics, including false positive and false negative rates, accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency, were used for evaluation. The results demonstrated that the proposed HCAP model achieved 98% accuracy in detecting cyberattacks and outperformed existing models, reducing the false positive rate by 25%. The false negative rate by 20% and a 30% improvement in computational efficiency enhances the reliability of IoMT threat detection in healthcare applications.",

    "abstract": "Implantable devices represent the future of remote medical monitoring and administration of both chemical and physical therapies to the patients. Although some of these devices are already in the market, the security mechanisms deployed inside them to withstand deliberate external influence are still decades away from the robust digital data security schemes employed in modern distributed networks these days. Medical data theft, spoofing, and disclosure pose serious threats that can ultimately lead to individual and social stigmas or even death. In this article, we present a small-form and batteryless implantable device with acquisition channels for biopotential (30-dB gain and 16-Hz bandwidth), arterial pulse oximetry, and temperature (0.12°C accuracy) recordings, suitable for cardiovascular, neuronal, and endocrine parameters assessment. The proposed device is powered by the near-field communication (NFC) interface with an external mobile phone, with a power consumption of 0.9 mW and achieving the full operation for distances close to 1 cm under the skin. In situ encryption of the acquired physiological signals is performed by a lightweight and short-term symmetric-key distribution scheme with data stream hopping, in order to ensure secure data transference over the air between the patient and trusted entities only, complemented by data storage, processing, and recovery through a medical blockchain type of network that involves the main stakeholders inside a medical community.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a state-of-the-art overview of the intertwined privacy, confidentiality, and security issues that are commonly encountered in health research involving disaggregate geographic data about individuals. Key definitions are provided, along with some examples of actual and potential security and confidentiality breaches and related incidents that captured mainstream media and public interest in recent months and years. The paper then goes on to present a brief survey of the research literature on location privacy/confidentiality concerns and on privacy-preserving solutions in conventional health research and beyond, touching on the emerging privacy issues associated with online consumer geoinformatics and location-based services. The 'missing ring' (in many treatments of the topic) of data security is also discussed. Personal information and privacy legislations in two countries, Canada and the UK, are covered, as well as some examples of recent research projects and events about the subject. Select highlights from a June 2009 URISA (Urban and Regional Information Systems Association) workshop entitled 'Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality of Geographic Data in Health Research' are then presented. The paper concludes by briefly charting the complexity of the domain and the many challenges associated with it, and proposing a novel, 'one stop shop' case-based reasoning framework to streamline the provision of clear and individualised guidance for the design and approval of new research projects (involving geographical identifiers about individuals), including crisp recommendations on which specific privacy-preserving solutions and approaches would be suitable in each case.",

    "abstract": "To ensure optimal use of images while preserving privacy, it is necessary to partition the shared image into public and private areas, with public areas being openly accessible and private areas being shared in a controlled and privacy-preserving manner. Current works only facilitate image-level sharing and use common cryptographic algorithms. To ensure efficient, controlled, and privacy-preserving image sharing at the area level, this paper proposes an image partition security-sharing mechanism based on blockchain and chaotic encryption, which mainly includes a fine-grained access control method based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and an image-specific chaotic encryption scheme. The proposed fine-grained access control method employs smart contracts based on the ABAC model to achieve automatic access control for private areas. It employs a Cuckoo filter-based transaction retrieval technique to enhance the efficiency of smart contracts in retrieving security attributes and policies on the blockchain. The proposed chaotic encryption scheme generates keys based on the private areas' security attributes, largely reducing the number of keys required. It also provides efficient encryption with vector operation acceleration. The security analysis and performance evaluation were conducted comprehensively. The results show that the proposed mechanism has lower time overhead than current works as the number of images increases.",

    "abstract": "The task of named entity recognition (NER) plays a crucial role in extracting cybersecurity-related information. Existing approaches for cybersecurity entity extraction predominantly rely on manual labelling data, resulting in labour-intensive processes due to the lack of a cybersecurity-specific corpus. In this paper, we propose an improved self-training-based distant label denoising method for cybersecurity entity extraction. Firstly, we create two domain dictionaries of cybersecurity. Then, an algorithm that combines reverse maximum matching and part-of-speech tagging restrictions is proposed, for generating distant labels for the cybersecurity domain corpus. Lastly, we propose a high-confidence text selection method and an improved self-training algorithm that incorporates a teacher-student model and weight update constraints, for exploring the true labels of low-confidence text using a model trained on high-confidence text, thereby reducing the noise in the distant annotation data. Experimental results demonstrate that the cybersecurity distantly-labelled data we obtained is of high quality. Additionally, the proposed constrained self-training algorithm effectively improves the F1 score of several state-of-the-art NER models on this dataset, yielding a 3.5% improvement for the Vendor class and a 3.35% improvement for the Product class.",

In particular, a systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to answer specific research questions and provide guidelines for designing the architecture. Subsequently, a case study was designed and analyzed at a chemotherapy treatment center for outpatients. System architecture knowledge was distilled from this real-world case study, supplemented by existing software and systems design patterns. A novel five-layer architecture for digital twins in healthcare units was proposed with a focus on the security and privacy of patients' information. The proposed digital twin architecture for healthcare units offers a comprehensive solution that provides modularity, scalability, security, and interoperability. The architecture provides a robust framework for effectively and efficiently managing healthcare environments.",

    "title": "Distributed clone detection in static wireless sensor networks: random walk with network division.",
    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are vulnerable to clone attacks or node replication attacks as they are deployed in hostile and unattended environments where they are deprived of physical protection, lacking physical tamper-resistance of sensor nodes. As a result, an adversary can easily capture and compromise sensor nodes and after replicating them, he inserts arbitrary number of clones/replicas into the network. If these clones are not efficiently detected, an adversary can be further capable to mount a wide variety of internal attacks which can emasculate the various protocols and sensor applications. Several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address the crucial problem of clone detection, which are not satisfactory as they suffer from some serious drawbacks. In this paper we propose a novel distributed solution called Random Walk with Network Division (RWND) for the detection of node replication attack in static WSNs which is based on claimer-reporter-witness framework and combines a simple random walk with network division. RWND detects clone(s) by following a claimer-reporter-witness framework and a random walk is employed within each area for the selection of witness nodes. Splitting the network into levels and areas makes clone detection more efficient and the high security of witness nodes is ensured with moderate communication and memory overheads. Our simulation results show that RWND outperforms the existing witness node based strategies with moderate communication and memory overheads.",

    "title": "Simultaneous compression and encryption of closely resembling images: application to video sequences and polarimetric images.",
    "abstract": "This study presents and validates an optimized method of simultaneous compression and encryption designed to process images with close spectra. This approach is well adapted to the compression and encryption of images of a time-varying scene but also to static polarimetric images. We use the recently developed spectral fusion method [Opt. Lett.35, 1914-1916 (2010)] to deal with the close resemblance of the images. The spectral plane (containing the information to send and/or to store) is decomposed in several independent areas which are assigned according a specific way. In addition, each spectrum is shifted in order to minimize their overlap. The dual purpose of these operations is to optimize the spectral plane allowing us to keep the low- and high-frequency information (compression) and to introduce an additional noise for reconstructing the images (encryption). Our results show that not only can the control of the spectral plane enhance the number of spectra to be merged, but also that a compromise between the compression rate and the quality of the reconstructed images can be tuned. We use a root-mean-square (RMS) optimization criterion to treat compression. Image encryption is realized at different security levels. Firstly, we add a specific encryption level which is related to the different areas of the spectral plane, and then, we make use of several random phase keys. An in-depth analysis at the spectral fusion methodology is done in order to find a good trade-off between the compression rate and the quality of the reconstructed images. Our new proposal spectral shift allows us to minimize the image overlap. We further analyze the influence of the spectral shift on the reconstructed image quality and compression rate. The performance of the multiple-image optical compression and encryption method is verified by analyzing several video sequences and polarimetric images.",

Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks.

Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones.

    "title": "INNBC DApp, a decentralized application to permanently store biomedical data on a modern, proof-of-stake (POS), blockchain such as BNB Smart Chain.",
    "abstract": "A blockchain can be described as a distributed ledger database where, under a consensus mechanism, data are permanently stored in records, called blocks, linked together with cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash function of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, which are permanently stored in thousands of nodes and never altered. This provides a potential real-world application for generating a permanent, decentralized record of scientific data, taking advantage of blockchain features such as timestamping and immutability. Here, we propose INNBC DApp, a Web3 decentralized application providing a simple front-end user interface connected with a smart contract for recording scientific data on a modern, proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain such as BNB Smart Chain. Unlike previously proposed blockchain tools that only store a hash of the data on-chain, here the data are stored fully on-chain within the transaction itself as \"transaction input data\", with a true decentralized storage solution. In addition to plain text, the DApp can record various types of files, such as documents, images, audio, and video, by using Base64 encoding. In this study, we describe how to use the DApp and perform real-world transactions storing different kinds of data from previously published research articles, describing the advantages and limitations of using such a technology, analyzing the cost in terms of transaction fees, and discussing possible use cases. We have been able to store several different types of data on the BNB Smart Chain: raw text, documents, images, audio, and video. Notably, we stored several complete research articles at a reasonable cost. We found a limit of 95KB for each single file upload. Considering that Base64 encoding increases file size by approximately 33%, this provides us with a theoretical limit of 126KB. We successfully overcome this limitation by splitting larger files into smaller chunks and uploading them as multi-volume archives. Additionally, we propose AES encryption to protect sensitive data. Accordingly, we show that it is possible to include enough data to be useful for storing and sharing scientific documents and images on the blockchain at a reasonable cost for the users. INNBC DApp represents a real use case for blockchain technology in decentralizing biomedical data storage and sharing, providing us with features such as immutability, timestamp, and identity that can be used to ensure permanent availability of the data and to provide proof-of-existence as well as to protect authorship, a freely available decentralized science (DeSci) tool aiming to help bring mass adoption of blockchain technology among the scientific community.",

Due to the problems of difficult data collection, long project period, complex data, poor security, difficult traceability and data intercommunication, the archives management of most national infrastructure is still in the pre-information era. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a trusted data storage architecture for national infrastructure based on blockchain. This consists of real-time collection of national infrastructure construction data through sensors and other Internet of Things devices, conversion of heterogeneous data source data into a unified format according to specific business flows, and timely storage of data in the blockchain to ensure data security and persistence. Knowledge extraction of data stored in the chain and the data of multiple regions or fields are jointly modeled through federal learning. The parameters and results are stored in the chain, and the information of each node is shared to solve the problem of data intercommunication.",

During the process, the liquidity transfer of information or assets can increase the use of items with other chains, so it is worth noting that the enhancement of cross-chain liquidity is of great practical importance to cross-chain technology. In this model, Layerzero is used as the primary secure cross-chain facility to build a full-chain identity by unifying NFT-distributed autonomous cross-chain identity IDs; applying super-contract pairs to enhance cross-chain liquidity; and initiating a dynamic transaction node creditworthiness model to increase the security of the cross-chain model and its risk management. Finally, by verifying three important property metrics timeliness is improved by at least 18%, robustness is increased by at least 50.9%, and radius of convergence is reduced by at least 25%. It is verified that the liquidity cross-chain model can eliminate the authentication transition between hierarchies while saving the cross-chain time cost, as a way to truly realize the liquid interoperability between multiple chains of blockchain.",

As a new subgroup of smart biosensors, they show great potential for protecting information as a molecular security data processor, rather than merely molecular recognition and quantitation. Herein, label-free electrochemically transduced Ag and cysteine (Cys) sensors were developed. A molecular keypad lock model with reset function was successfully realized based on the balanced interaction of metal ion with its nucleic acid and chemical ligands. The correct input of \"1-2-3\" (i.e., \"Ag -Cys-cDNA\") is the only password of such molecular keypad lock. Moreover, the resetting process of either correct or wrong input order could be easily made by Cys, buffer, and DI water treatment. Therefore, our system provides an even smarter system of molecular keypad lock, which could inhibit illegal access of unauthorized users, holding great promise in information protection at the molecular level.",

However, communication between drones and ground control systems must be protected to avoid potential vulnerabilities and improve coordination among scattered UAVs in the IoT context. In the current paper, a distributed UAV scheme is proposed that uses blockchain technology and a network topology similar to the IoT and cloud server to secure communications during data collection and transmission and reduce the likelihood of attack by maliciously manipulated UAVs. As an alternative to relying on a traditional blockchain approach, a unique, safe, and lightweight blockchain architecture is proposed that reduces computing and storage requirements while keeping privacy and security advantages. In addition, a unique reputation-based consensus protocol is built to assure the dependability of the decentralized network. Numerous types of transactions are established to characterize diverse data access. To validate the presented blockchain-based distributed system, performance evaluations are conducted to estimate the statistical effectiveness in the form of temporal delay, packet flow efficacy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and security efficiency.",

IoT devices generally have limited storage and processing capabilities, and configuring any security techniques on these devices is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel device identity management approach for blockchain-based IoT systems that provides data security in two ways. Firstly, a lightweight time-based identification protocol that uses hub identification for validating data. Secondly, data storage is augmented with an effective blockchain application for providing easy access and immutability for data sharing among multiple parties. Our initial prototype implementation shows that: our identity management approach can be implemented in large scale settings, our system can be effectively implemented in blockchain platforms, and our performance evaluation result shows that the prototype fulfills system requirements adequately.",

    "abstract": "Within the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain research, there is a growing interest in decentralizing health monitoring systems, to provide improved privacy to patients, without relying on trusted third parties for handling patients' sensitive health data. With public blockchain deployments being severely limited in their scalability, and inherently having latency in transaction processing, there is room for researching and developing new techniques to leverage the security features of blockchains within healthcare applications. This paper presents a solution for patients to share their biomedical data with their doctors without their data being handled by trusted third party entities. The solution is built on the Ethereum blockchain as a medium for negotiating and record-keeping, along with Tor for delivering data from patients to doctors. To highlight the applicability of the solution in various health monitoring scenarios, we have considered three use-cases, namely cardiac monitoring, sleep apnoea testing, and EEG following epileptic seizures. Following the discussion about the use cases, the paper outlines a security analysis performed on the proposed solution, based on multiple attack scenarios. Finally, the paper presents and discusses a performance evaluation in terms of data delivery time in comparison to existing centralized and decentralized solutions.",

    "abstract": "To ensure only authorized access to medical services, several authentication schemes for telecare medicine information systems (TMIS) have been proposed in the literature. Due to its better performance than traditional cryptography, Hao et al. proposed an authentication scheme for TMIS using chaotic map based cryptography. They claimed that their scheme could resist various attacks, including the smart card stolen attack. However, we identify that their scheme is vulnerable to the stolen smart card attack. The reason causing the stolen smart card attack is that the scheme is designed based on the assumption that the scheme itself achieves user untraceability. Then, we propose a robust authentication and key agreement scheme. Compared with the previous schemes, our scheme not only enjoys more security features, but also has better efficiency. Our analysis indicates that designing a two-factor authentication scheme based on the assumption that privacy protection is achieved in the scheme itself may pose potential security risks. The lesson learned is that, we should avoid this situation in the future design of two-factor authentication schemes.",

The framework breaks down CDSS into data gathering, data management and data delivery functions. It then provides the vulnerabilities that can occur in clinical decision support activities and the measures that need to be taken to protect the data. The framework is applied to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health data in a decision support system. Using the framework, project managers and architects can assess the potential risk of unauthorized data access in their decision support system. Moreover they can design systems and procedures to effectively secure personal health data.",

The sender's cheating is also studied. The optimal CSQBC protocols that can minimize the sum of the cheating probabilities of both parties are found to be trivial, as they are practically useless.

However, blockchain technology and smart manufacturing have been individually researched in academia and industry, according to the literature. This survey aims to summarize the existing research to provide theoretical foundations for applying blockchain technology to smart manufacturing, thus creating a more reliable and authentic smart manufacturing system. In this regard, the literature related to four types of critical issues in smart manufacturing is introduced: data security, data sharing, trust mechanisms and system coordination issues. The corresponding blockchain solutions were reviewed and analyzed. Based on the insights obtained from the above analysis, a reference framework for blockchain technology-enabled smart manufacturing systems is put forward. The challenges and future research directions are also discussed to provide potential guides for achieving better utilization of this technology in smart manufacturing.",

Here we provide an extended analysis and present an experimental support of a concept for a classical key generation system, based on establishing laser oscillation between two parties, which is realized using standard fiber-optic components. In our Ultra-long Fiber Laser (UFL) system, each user places a randomly chosen, spectrally selective mirror at his/her end of a fiber laser, with the two-mirror choice representing a key bit. We demonstrate the ability of each user to extract the mirror choice of the other using a simple analysis of the UFL signal, while an adversary can only reconstruct a small fraction of the key. The simplicity of this system renders it a promising alternative for practical key distribution in the optical domain.",

Consequently, it becomes crucial to create a standardized, transparent, and secure framework for processing medical data. This includes setting the ethical boundaries for medical artificial intelligence and safeguarding both patient rights and data integrity.

Yet many AHC executives may not have sufficient knowledge of the potential impact of cyberattacks on institutional missions such as clinical care, research, and education. Improved cybersecurity awareness and education are areas of opportunity for many AHCs. The authors developed and facilitated a tabletop cybersecurity simulation at an international conference for AHC leaders in September 2019 to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues and threats and to provide a forum for discussions of concerns specific to CEOs and C-suite-level executives. The 3.5-hour interactive simulation used an evolving, 3-phase case study describing a hypothetical cyberattack on an AHC with a ransomware demand. The approximately 70 participants, from AHCs spanning 25 states and 11 countries, worked in teams and discussed how they would react if they held roles similar to their real-life positions. The authors provide the full scenario as a resource. The exercise was well received by the participants. In the postsession debrief, many participants noted that cybersecurity preparedness had not received the level of institutional attention given to threats such as epidemics or natural disasters. Significant variance in teams' courses of action during the simulation highlighted a lack of consensus with regard to foundational decisions. Participants identified this as an area that could be remedied by the development of guidelines or protocols. As health care cybersecurity challenges persist or grow in magnitude, AHCs will have increased opportunities to lead in the development of best practices for preparedness and response. AHCs are well positioned to work with clinicians, security professionals, regulators, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to develop tools and protocols to improve health care cybersecurity and better protect patients.",

    "abstract": "The progress in generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), opened new possibilities for image generation but raised concerns about potential malicious uses, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging. This study introduces MITS-GAN, a novel approach to prevent tampering in medical images, with a specific focus on CT scans. The approach disrupts the output of the attacker's CT-GAN architecture by introducing finely tuned perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye. Specifically, the proposed approach involves the introduction of appropriate Gaussian noise to the input as a protective measure against various attacks. Our method aims to enhance tamper resistance, comparing favorably to existing techniques. Experimental results on a CT scan demonstrate MITS-GAN's superior performance, emphasizing its ability to generate tamper-resistant images with negligible artifacts. As image tampering in medical domains poses life-threatening risks, our proactive approach contributes to the responsible and ethical use of generative models. This work provides a foundation for future research in countering cyber threats in medical imaging. Models and codes are publicly available. .",

    "abstract": "Classification is the problem of identifying a set of categories where new data belong, on the basis of a set of training data whose category membership is known. Its application is wide-spread, such as the medical science domain. The issue of the classification knowledge protection has been paid attention increasingly in recent years because of the popularity of cloud environments. In the paper, we propose a Shaking Sorted-Sampling (triple-S) algorithm for protecting the classification knowledge of a dataset. The triple-S algorithm sorts the data of an original dataset according to the projection results of the principal components analysis so that the features of the adjacent data are similar. Then, we generate noise data with incorrect classes and add those data to the original dataset. In addition, we develop an effective positioning strategy, determining the added positions of noise data in the original dataset, to ensure the restoration of the original dataset after removing those noise data. The experimental results show that the disturbance effect of the triple-S algorithm on the CLC, MySVM, and LibSVM classifiers increases when the noise data ratio increases. In addition, compared with existing methods, the disturbance effect of the triple-S algorithm is more significant on MySVM and LibSVM when a certain amount of the noise data added to the original dataset is reached.",

    "abstract": "Data security is a critical issue in an organization; a proper information security management (ISM) is an ongoing process that seeks to build and maintain programs, policies, and controls for protecting information. A hospital is one of the most complex organizations, where patient information has not only legal and economic implications but, more importantly, an impact on the patient's health. Imaging studies include medical images, patient identification data, and proprietary information of the study; these data are contained in the storage device of a PACS. This system must preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient information. There are techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and data encapsulation that contribute to the protection of information. In addition, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard and the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations are also used to protect the patient clinical data. However, these techniques are not systematically applied to the picture and archiving and communication system (PACS) in most cases and are not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the images and associated data during transmission. The ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard has been developed to improve the ISM. Currently, health institutions lack effective ISM processes that enable reliable interorganizational activities. In this paper, we present a business model that accomplishes the controls of ISO/IEC 27002:2013 standard and criteria of security and privacy from DICOM and HIPAA to improve the ISM of a large-scale PACS. The methodology associated with the model can monitor the flow of data in a PACS, facilitating the detection of unauthorized access to images and other abnormal activities.",

In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a scalable low-area FPGA hardware architecture that serves as a building block to accelerate the costly operations of exponentiation and multiplication in [Formula: see text], commonly required in security protocols relying on public key encryption, such as in key agreement, authentication and digital signature. The proposed design can process operands of different size using the same datapath, which exhibits a significant reduction in area without loss of efficiency if compared to representative state of the art designs. For example, our design uses 96% less standard logic than a similar design optimized for performance, and 46% less resources than other design optimized for area. Even using fewer area resources, our design still performs better than its embedded software counterparts (190x and 697x).",

    "title": "FastEmbed: Predicting vulnerability exploitation possibility based on ensemble machine learning algorithm.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of vulnerabilities discovered and publicly disclosed has shown a sharp upward trend. However, the value of exploitation of vulnerabilities varies for attackers, considering that only a small fraction of vulnerabilities are exploited. Therefore, the realization of quick exclusion of the non-exploitable vulnerabilities and optimal patch prioritization on limited resources has become imperative for organizations. Recent works using machine learning techniques predict exploited vulnerabilities by extracting features from open-source intelligence (OSINT). However, in the face of explosive growth of vulnerability information, there is room for improvement in the application of past methods to multiple threat intelligence. A more general method is needed to deal with various threat intelligence sources. Moreover, in previous methods, traditional text processing methods were used to deal with vulnerability related descriptions, which only grasped the static statistical characteristics but ignored the context and the meaning of the words of the text. To address these challenges, we propose an exploit prediction model, which is based on a combination of fastText and LightGBM algorithm and called fastEmbed. We replicate key portions of the state-of-the-art work of exploit prediction and use them as benchmark models. Our model outperforms the baseline model whether in terms of the generalization ability or the prediction ability without temporal intermixing with an average overall improvement of 6.283% by learning the embedding of vulnerability-related text on extremely imbalanced data sets. Besides, in terms of predicting the exploits in the wild, our model also outperforms the baseline model with an F1 measure of 0.586 on the minority class (33.577% improvement over the work using features from darkweb/deepweb). The results demonstrate that the model can improve the ability to describe the exploitability of vulnerabilities and predict exploits in the wild effectively.",

The encryption system employs feedback ciphertext to achieve plaintext dependence of sub-keys. Unfortunately, we discovered that their scheme is unable to withstand key stream attack. To improve its security, this paper proposes a novel chaotic map based block cryptosystem. At the same time, a secure architecture for camera sensor network is constructed. The network comprises a set of inexpensive camera sensors to capture the images, a sink node equipped with sufficient computation and storage capabilities and a data processing server. The transmission security between the sink node and the server is gained by utilizing the improved cipher. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the improved algorithm can overcome the flaws and maintain all the merits of the original cryptosystem. In addition, computational costs and efficiency of the proposed scheme are encouraging for the practical implementation in the real environment as well as camera sensor network.",

    "title": "A Literature Review on the GDPR, COVID-19 and the Ethical Considerations of Data Protection During a Time of Crisis.",
    "abstract": "This survey article presents a literature review of relevant publications aiming to explore whether the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has held true during a time of crisis and the implications that arose during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the approach taken and the screening of the relevant articles, the results focus on three themes: a critique on GDPR; the ethics surrounding the use of digital health technologies, namely in the form of mobile applications; and the possibility of cross border transfers of said data outside of Europe. Within this context, the article reviews the arising themes, considers the use of data through mobile health applications, and discusses whether data protection may require a revision when balancing societal and personal interests. In summary, although it is clear that the GDPR has been applied through a mixed and complex experience with data handling during the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed shown that it was a test the GDPR was designed and prepared to undertake. The article suggests that further review and research is needed to first ensure that an understanding of the state of the art in data protection during the pandemic is maintained and second to subsequently explore and carefully create a specific framework for the ethical considerations involved. The paper echoes the literature reviewed and calls for the creation of a unified and harmonised network or database to enable the secure data sharing across borders.",

One of the best-established formats is the open standard of PDF (Portable Document Format), which is renowned for its flexibility and stability. In this article, we expose a major flaw in the format with respect to the security of confidential information, such that even organizations responsible for safeguarding and setting the standards for data management were unintentionally revealing confidential patient data. By collecting and analysing a random sample of files from a health informatics organization, we demonstrate the extent of the problem and determine its cause by code analysis of an example. In conclusion, we suggest the development of a knowledge-sharing format that does not demand expert skills for safe usage: WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Store).",

    "abstract": "The person from whom body materials were collected, first becomes their owner in analogy to section 953 German Civil Code. This applies also if the body materials were taken within the framework of a treatment contract and remain there after the treatment/diagnosis have ended. Only if an explicit consent of the patient was given to the effect that the body materials are to be owned by the clinic/doctor, only then is it possible to transfer ownership. A conclusive transfer of ownership does not occur. A complete anonymisation makes the body materials ownerless since an assignment to a person is not possible any longer. In this case, the former carrier of the body materials has no further chance to make claim to any rights. In that case, science and biotechnological industry are free to utilize the body materials. The former carrier of the body materials may make claims to benefit sharing only if instead of an anonymisation only a pseudonymisation takes place. However, it is common practice that the payment for damages according to existing rights to benefit sharing after unlawful use is quite small. Only a trustee model could achieve that property rights be observed, that personal or personality rights are protected in the best possible manner and that proper benefit sharing be done.",

    "abstract": "As smart devices and mobile positioning technologies improve, location-based services (LBS) have grown in popularity. The LBS environment provides considerable convenience to users, but it also poses a significant threat to their privacy. A large number of research works have emerged to protect users' privacy. Dummy-based location privacy protection solutions have been widely adopted for their simplicity and enhanced privacy protection results, but there are few reviews on dummy-based location privacy protection. Or, for existing works, some focus on aspects of cryptography, anonymity, or other comprehensive reviews that do not provide enough reviews on dummy-based privacy protection. In this paper, the authors provide a review of dummy-based location privacy protection techniques for location-based services. More specifically, the connection between the level of privacy protection, the quality of service, and the system overhead is summarized. The difference and connection between various location privacy protection techniques are also described. The dummy-based attack models are presented. Then, the algorithms for dummy location selection are analyzed and evaluated. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate different dummy location selection methods and arrive at a highly useful evaluation result. This result is valuable both to users and researchers who are studying this field.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile network, tablets and smart phones have become sorts of keys to access personal secured services in our daily life. People use these devices to manage personal finances, shop on the Internet, and even pay at vending machines. Besides, it also helps us get connected with friends and business partners through social network applications, which were widely used as personal identifications in both real and virtual societies. However, these devices use inherently weak authentication mechanism, based upon passwords and PINs that is not changed all the time. Although forcing users to change password periodically can enhance the security level, it may also be considered annoyances for users. Biometric technologies are straightforward because of the simple authentication process. However, most of the traditional biometrics methodologies require diverse equipment to acquire biometric information, which may be expensive and not portable. This paper proposes a multibiometric user authentication scheme with both physiological and behavioral biometrics. Only simple rotations with fingers on multitouch devices are required to enhance the security level without annoyances for users. In addition, the user credential is replaceable to prevent from the privacy leakage.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to examine recent social and technical habits related to high-tech environments. Our goal was to show that the prevention of risk behaviors due to training in data processing, requires an interdisciplinary approach where medical anthropology could benefit from and exchange of complementary information sources (particularly from psychiatrics and psychoanalysis). We used this approach to search for solutions regarding new kinds of addiction. When identifying pathological conditions and proposing appropriate care, these solutions must take into consideration the progressive loss of human nature in data processing environments and the very important and highly sophisticated relationship established between the human being and the computer. We looked at the hacker population as a modern tribe and marginal group. Our analysis led to a better understanding of this kind of artificial culture, sometimes called a \"high-tech\" or \"cyber\" culture. The hacker population is integrating new rituals, languages and special rhythms which induce addictions. We show how high-tech environments operating in e-time and e-life induce addictions. This work illustrates a classical anthropological approach to the question (ethnological fields, interviews, literature analysis). The major challenge is to explain how high-tech environments present high risks for dependency in the hacker population and other, unwarned, computer (ab)users.",

    "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoTs) and cloud technologies spark dramatic growth in efficiency and productivity for the conventional e-health sector. However, the extensive applications of the communication network also expose the sensitive medical data to the unprecedented cyber threats. To protect the data privacy in IoTs-based e-health cloud environments, we propose an adaptively secure data sharing scheme with traceability and equality test (T-ABEET). The T-ABEET not only allows flexible access control to the massive data but also provides the functionality of traitor tracing to identity the users who leak their decryption keys. Meanwhile, through carrying out the equality test, the target ciphertext can be retrieved efficiently without revealing anything about the plaintext. Particularly, distinct from previous traceable ABE works, the tracing cost in our T-ABEET scheme keeps constant even with the increasing number of users. Also, by introducing the multi-authority mechanism, our T-ABEET can avoid the inherent key escrow problem of ABE. Furthermore, our T-ABEET is demonstrated adaptively secure under subgroup decision assumption. Finally, performance comparison reveals that our T-ABEET has superior practicality, efficiency, and security in cloud-enabled e-health systems.",

This strong form of security is possible only when using correlations that violate a Bell inequality. Here, we provide a general security proof for a large class of protocols in a model in which the raw key is generated by independent measurements. This independence condition may be justifiable in several implementations and is necessarily satisfied when the raw key is generated by N separate pairs of devices. Our work shows that device-independent QKD is possible with key rates comparable to those of standard schemes.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a Built-in-self-Test (BIST) implemented Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptoprocessor Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). AES has been proved as the strongest symmetric encryption algorithm declared by USA Govt. and it outperforms all other existing cryptographic algorithms. Its hardware implementation offers much higher speed and physical security than that of its software implementation. Due to this reason, a number of AES cryptoprocessor ASIC have been presented in the literature, but the problem of testability in the complex AES chip is not addressed yet. This research introduces a solution to the problem for the AES cryptoprocessor ASIC implementing mixed-mode BIST technique, a hybrid of pseudo-random and deterministic techniques. The BIST implemented ASIC is designed using IEEE industry standard Hardware Description Language(HDL). It has been simulated using Electronic Design Automation (EDA)tools for verification and validation using the input-output data from the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) of the USA Govt. The simulation results show that the design is working as per desired functionalities in different modes of operation of the ASIC. The current research is compared with those of other researchers, and it shows that it is unique in terms of BIST implementation into the ASIC chip.",

    "title": "Conclusion: harmonisation in genomic and health data sharing for research: an impossible dream?",
    "abstract": "There are clear benefits from genomics and health data sharing in research and in therapy for individuals across societies. At the same time, citizens have different expectations and fears about that data sharing. International legislation in relation with research ethics and practice and, particularly, data protection create a particular environment that, as is seen in the articles in part two of this special issue, are crying out for harmonisation both at a procedural but at fundamental conceptual levels. The law of data sharing is pulling in different directions. This paper poses the question, 'harmonisation, an impossible dream?' and the answer is a qualified 'no'. The paper reflects on what can be seen in the papers in part two of the special issue. It then identifies three major areas of conceptual uncertainty in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (not because it has superiority over other jurisdictions, but because it is a recent revision of data protection law that leaves universal conceptual questions unclear). Thereafter, the potential for Artificial Intelligence to meet some of the shortcomings is discussed. The paper ends with a consideration of the conditions under which data sharing harmonisation might be achieved: an understanding of a human rights approach and citizen sensitivities in considering the 'public interest'; social liberalism as a basis of solidarity; and the profession of 'researcher'.",

    "abstract": "Malicious software and infectious diseases are similar is several respects, as are the functional requirements for surveillance and intelligence to defend against these threats. Given these similarities, this article compares and contrasts the actors, relationships, and norms at work in cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. Historical analysis reveals that civilian cyber defense is more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health in the United States. Most of these differences are due to political choices rather than technical necessities. In particular, political resistance to government institutions has shaped cyber intelligence over the past 30 years, which is a troubling sign for attempts to improve disease surveillance through local, state, and federal health departments. Information sharing about malware is also limited, despite information technology being integral to cyberspace. Such limits suggest that automation through electronic health records will not automatically improve public health surveillance. Still, certain aspects of information sharing and analysis for cyber defense are worth emulating or, at the very least, learning from to help detect and manage health threats.",

    "abstract": "The structure of healthcare systems in developed countries is changing to 'shared care', enforced by economic constraints and caused by a change in the basic conditions of care. That development results in co-operative health information systems across the boundaries of organisational, technological, and policy domains. Increasingly, these distributed and, as far as their domains are concerned, heterogeneous systems are based on middleware approaches, such as CORBA. Regarding the sensitivity of personal and medical data, such open, distributed, and heterogeneous health information systems require a high level of data protection and data security, both with respect to patient information and with respect to users. This paper, relying on experience gained through our activities in CORBAmed, describes the possibilities the CORBA middleware provides to achieve application and communication security. On the background of the overall CORBA architecture, it outlines the different security services previewed in the adopted CORBA specifications which are discussed in the context of the security requirements of healthcare information systems. Security services required in the healthcare domain but not available at the moment are mentioned. A solution is proposed, which on the one hand allows to make use of the available CORBA security services and additional ones, on the other hand remains open to other middleware approaches, such as DHE or HL7.",

    "abstract": "To assess the employment and status of privacy, confidentiality, security and fair information practices in electronic information systems of U.S. state health agencies. A survey instrument was developed and administered to key contacts within the state health agencies of each of the 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. About a third of U.S. state health agencies have no written policies in place regarding privacy and confidentiality in electronic information systems. The doctrines of fair information practice often seemed to be ignored. One quarter of the agencies reported at least one security breach during the past two years, and 16% experienced a privacy and confidentiality related transgression. Most of the breaches were committed by personnel from within the agencies. These results raise questions about the integrity of existing privacy, confidentiality and security measures in the information systems of U.S. state health agencies. Recommendations include the development and vigorous enforcement of written privacy and confidentiality policies, increased personnel training, and expanded implementation of security measures such as encryption and system firewalls. A discussion of the current status of U.S. privacy, confidentiality and security issues is offered.",

    "abstract": "Data from individual collections, such as biobanks and cohort studies, are now being shared in order to create combined datasets which can be queried to ask complex scientific questions. But this sharing must be done with due regard for data protection principles. DataSHIELD is a new technology that queries nonaggregated, individual-level data in situ but returns query data in an anonymous format. This raises questions of the ability of DataSHIELD to adequately protect participant confidentiality. An ethico-legal analysis was conducted that examined each step of the DataSHIELD process from the perspective of UK case law, regulations, and guidance. DataSHIELD reaches agreed UK standards of protection for the sharing of biomedical data. All direct processing of personal data is conducted within the protected environment of the contributing study; participating studies have scientific, ethics, and data access approvals in place prior to the analysis; studies are clear that their consents conform with this use of data, and participants are informed that anonymisation for further disclosure will take place. DataSHIELD can provide a flexible means of interrogating data while protecting the participants' confidentiality in accordance with applicable legislation and guidance.",

However, many recently published ECC based RFID authentication schemes have serious security weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a new ECC based RFID authentication integrated with an ID verifier transfer protocol that overcomes the weaknesses of the existing schemes. A comprehensive security analysis has been conducted to show strong security properties that are provided from the proposed authentication scheme. Moreover, the performance of the proposed authentication scheme is analyzed in terms of computational cost, communicational cost, and storage requirement.",

    "title": "Opportunities and challenges provided by cloud repositories for bioinformatics-enabled drug discovery.",
    "abstract": "Healthcare-related bioinformatics databases are increasingly offering the possibility to maintain, organize, and distribute DNA sequencing data. Different national and international institutions are currently hosting such databases that offer researchers website platforms where they can obtain sequencing data on which they can perform different types of analysis. Until recently, this process remained mostly one-dimensional, with most analysis concentrated on a limited amount of data. However, newer genome sequencing technology is producing a huge amount of data that current computer facilities are unable to handle. An alternative approach has been to start adopting cloud computing services for combining the information embedded in genomic and model system biology data, patient healthcare records, and clinical trials' data. In this new technological paradigm, researchers use virtual space and computing power from existing commercial or not-for-profit cloud service providers to access, store, and analyze data via different application programming interfaces. Cloud services are an alternative to the need of larger data storage; however, they raise different ethical, legal, and social issues. The purpose of this Commentary is to summarize how cloud computing can contribute to bioinformatics-based drug discovery and to highlight some of the outstanding legal, ethical, and social issues that are inherent in the use of cloud services.",

    "title": "A Secure LEACH-PRO Protocol Based on Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming more popular for many applications due to their convenient services. However, sensor nodes may suffer from significant security flaws, leading researchers to propose authentication schemes to protect WSNs. Although these authentication protocols significantly fulfill the required protection, security enhancement with less energy consumption is essential to preserve the availability of resources and secure better performance. In 2020, Youssef et al. suggested a scheme called Enhanced Probabilistic Cluster Head Selection (LEACH-PRO) to extend the sensors' lifetime in WSNs. This paper introduces a new variant of the LEACH-PRO protocol by adopting the blockchain security technique to protect WSNs. The proposed protocol (SLEACH-PRO) performs a decentralized authentication mechanism by applying a blockchain to multiple base stations to avoid system and performance degradation in the event of a station failure. The security analysis of the SLEACH-PRO is performed using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. Moreover, the SLEACH-PRO is evaluated and compared to related protocols in terms of computational cost and security level based on its resistance against several attacks. The comparison results showed that the SLEACH-PRO protocol is more secure and requires less computational cost compared to other related protocols.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of digital health poses a critical challenge to the personal health data protection of patients. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) works in this context; it was passed in April 2016 and came into force in May 2018 across the European Union. This study is the first attempt to test the effectiveness of this legal reform for personal health data protection. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) approach, this study empirically examines the policy influence of the GDPR on the financial performance of hospitals across the European Union. Results show that hospitals with the digital health service suffered from financial distress after the GDPR was published in 2016. This reveals that during the transition period (2016⁻2018), hospitals across the European Union indeed made costly adjustments to meet the requirements of personal health data protection introduced by this new regulation, and thus inevitably suffered a policy shock to their financial performance in the short term. The implementation of GDPR may have achieved preliminary success.",

    "title": "The de-perimeterisation of information security: The Jericho Forum, zero trust, and narrativity.",
    "abstract": "This article analyses the transformation of information security induced by the Jericho Forum, a group of security professionals who argued for a new 'de-perimeterised' security model. Having focused on defensive perimeters around networks, early 2000s information security faced a growing set of pressures: the maintainability of firewalls given increasing traffic volume and variety, the vulnerability of interior network domains, and the need to cope with and enable new working arrangements and ways of doing business. De-perimeterisation was a radical rethinking of the nature of security and created the conditions for the rise of 'Zero Trust' architectures. This shift has radical implications for the architectures of digital infrastructures that undergird many aspects of contemporary life, the risks to which people and societies are exposed, and the nature of work and business in a digital economy. We develop a semiotic analysis of the Jericho Forum's interventions. Using insights from material semiotics, security theory and the theory of narrativity, we argue that de-perimeterisation can be understood as a shift in security logic, or, a shift in how security can (be made to) make sense. We examine a cluster of images used by the Jericho Forum, and analyse how they challenged the coherence of perimeter-based thinking and provided the materials for constructing a new model. We argue that a focus on the narrative dimension of security provides a window into fundamental semantic transformations, reciprocal historical relations between semantics and technical change, the of security technologies, and determinations of value (what is worth securing).",

    "abstract": "The use of broad consent in biobank research has implications for the procedures of ethics review. This paper describes these implications and makes a recommendation for how to deal with them. Two steps in the ethics review of biobank research can be distinguished. In a first step, a research ethics committee (REC) reviews a biobank's framework regarding oversight procedures (e.g. broad consent form and data protection model). A second step then reviews specific projects that require the release of particular biomaterial and/or data. This paper argues that only a few research-related risks remain for the second step of ethical review and that a self-regulated body such as a biobank internal access committee would suffice (in principle) to address these risks. The reduction of REC involvement in biobank research proposed here has three aims: (i) to conserve time and money, (ii) to allow RECs to focus on higher-risk areas, and (iii) to promote professional self-regulation. Assuming that the public understands that neither REC involvement nor competent access committees can guarantee 100% protection against misuse of data, the proposed reduction of REC involvement could also enhance the public perception of biobank research as an ethically-sensitive enterprise that can be sufficiently controlled through competent self-regulation. In order to compensate for reduced REC involvement and to maintain public trust, biobanks should implement safeguards such as public information on approved projects.",

    "abstract": "Data science can offer huge opportunities for government. With the ability to process larger and more complex datasets than ever before, it can provide better insights for policymakers and make services more tailored and efficient. As with all new technologies, there is a risk that we do not take up its opportunities and miss out on its enormous potential. We want people to feel confident to innovate with data. So, over the past 18 months, the Government Data Science Partnership has taken an open, evidence-based and user-centred approach to creating an ethical framework. It is a practical document that brings all the legal guidance together in one place, and is written in the context of new data science capabilities. As part of its development, we ran a public dialogue on data science ethics, including deliberative workshops, an experimental conjoint survey and an online engagement tool. The research supported the principles set out in the framework as well as provided useful insight into how we need to communicate about data science. It found that people had a low awareness of the term 'data science', but that showing data science examples can increase broad support for government exploring innovative uses of data. But people's support is highly context driven. People consider acceptability on a case-by-case basis, first thinking about the overall policy goals and likely intended outcome, and then weighing up privacy and unintended consequences. The ethical framework is a crucial start, but it does not solve all the challenges it highlights, particularly as technology is creating new challenges and opportunities every day. Continued research is needed into data minimization and anonymization, robust data models, algorithmic accountability, and transparency and data security. It also has revealed the need to set out a renewed deal between the citizen and state on data, to maintain and solidify trust in how we use people's data for social good.This article is part of the themed issue 'The ethical impact of data science'.",

A roundtable was organized in Giens, France in October 2018 to identify problem areas, the need for clarification and streamlining, and to make recommendations to promote clinical research while ensuring a high level of patient protection. After details were given about these developments, the roundtable participants were able to propose recommendations, primarily (1) to clarify: what is considered anonymized data, and what is \"public interest\" within the meaning of the GDPR; (2) for the French data protection authority (CNIL) to continue preparing reference methodologies to simplify the approval system; (3) to promote the secondary use of data by making it easier to inform patients and obtain broad patient consent, by specifying the circumstances under which their withdrawal and opposition rights apply, so as to limit the risk of bias; (4) to facilitate access to data warehouses by providing technological and methodological aids. The roundtable also recommends increasing discussions between authorities in Europe on research topics, encouraging French authorities to contribute to the preparation of codes of conduct and setting up a voluntary harmonization procedure to coordinate the opinions of data protection authorities, while ensuring that key documents are available in English.",

    "title": "Emerging Security Mechanisms for Medical Cyber Physical Systems.",
    "abstract": "The following decade will witness a surge in remote health-monitoring systems that are based on body-worn monitoring devices. These Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) will be capable of transmitting the acquired data to a private or public cloud for storage and processing. Machine learning algorithms running in the cloud and processing this data can provide decision support to healthcare professionals. There is no doubt that the security and privacy of the medical data is one of the most important concerns in designing an MCPS. In this paper, we depict the general architecture of an MCPS consisting of four layers: data acquisition, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action. Due to the differences in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer, different encryption schemes must be used to guarantee data privacy within that layer. We survey conventional and emerging encryption schemes based on their ability to provide secure storage, data sharing, and secure computation. Our detailed experimental evaluation of each scheme shows that while the emerging encryption schemes enable exciting new features such as secure sharing and secure computation, they introduce several orders-of-magnitude computational and storage overhead. We conclude our paper by outlining future research directions to improve the usability of the emerging encryption schemes in an MCPS.",

    "title": "Clinical databases and data protection: are they compatible?",
    "abstract": "In the current climate of clinical governance and audit, and in the setting of an active academic unit, an effective clinical database is an invaluable tool. In this article, we will present our neurovascular database, discuss the issues related to setting up the ideal clinical database, discuss the problems related to accurate data input and review the legal requirements of data protection. The success of a clinical database is reflected by the completeness of the data, the accessibility of the information and how useful it has proven to be. After 4 years of experimentation we currently use a database designed on Microsoft Access. The form is a single page. Junior medical staff input the information as medical staff have been found to be the most reliable personnel for data input in terms of accuracy. However, time is generally in short supply amongst this group. For our purposes, the ideal database is one that is simple, that can be used to flag up cases, rather than provide all of the information and ensures a complete dataset. The arrival of the UK 1998 Data Protection Act has put many clinical databases and registries in jeopardy, and introduced further bureaucracy to research. We discuss the Act and its interpretation by the General Medical Council, Medical Research Council, British Medical Association, Department of Health and our own trust with respect to databases and research.",

    "abstract": "Countries require measures to prevent food fraud, such as forgery of certificates or content change during production, which can occur throughout the supply chain, even if they have a certification system for quality food management. Therefore, there are recent cases of the introduction of blockchain tokens for quality and supply chain management; however, there are difficulties in introducing tokens in food fields, such as forest and agricultural products. To introduce tokens in the food sector, we selected wild-simulated ginseng, subject to quality management in Korea, analyzed the quality management process of wild-simulated ginseng, and selected the target for blockchain token introduction. We then identified potential token-related issues from consumers and suggested possible solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, more and more mobile devices have been connected to the Internet. The Internet environment is complicated, and network security incidents emerge endlessly. Traditional passive defense measures cannot fundamentally meet the network security requirements. Inspired by the heuristic establishment of multiple lines of defense in immunology, we designed and prototyped a Double Defense strategy with Endogenous Safety and Security (DDESS) based on multi-identifier network (MIN) architecture. DDESS adopts the idea of a zero-trust network, with identity authentication as the core for access control, which solves security problems of traditional IP networks. In addition, DDESS achieves individual static security defense through encryption and decryption, consortium blockchain, trusted computing whitelist, and remote attestation strategies. At the same time, with the dynamic collection of data traffic and access logs, as well as the understanding and prediction of the situation, DDESS can realize the situation awareness of network security and the cultivation of immune vaccines against unknown network attacks, thus achieving the active herd defense of network security.",

    "title": "A Study on the Adoption of Blockchain for IoT Devices in Supply Chain.",
    "abstract": "The integration of blockchain and IoT enables promising solutions in decentralized environments in contrast with centralized systems. The blockchain brings forth features such as fault tolerance, security, and transparency of the data in IoT devices. As there is requirement of consensus among the network nodes to agree on a single-state-of-ledger, nonetheless, the extensive computational requirement for the consensus protocol becomes a limitation in resource-constrained IoT devices with limited battery, computation, and communication capabilities. This study proposes an empirical approach on the adoption of blockchain in a supply chain environment. Furthermore, a modified version of the Raft consensus protocol is proposed for use in supply-chain environment on the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger. In Raft consensus protocol, each transaction is directed to the leader node that transmits it to the follower nodes, making the leader node the bottleneck thus inhibiting the scalability and throughput of the system. This also results in high latency for the network. The modified RAFT consensus protocol (mRAFT) is based on the idea of utilizing the idle follower nodes in disseminating the vote requests and log replication messages. A detailed empirical evaluation of the solution built on Hyperledger Caliper is performed to demonstrate the applicability of the system. The improved workload division on the peers boosts the throughput and latency of the system in ordering service that enhances the overall efficiency of the system.",

    "title": "A novel development to encrypt data communication under t-intuitionistic fuzzy environment.",
    "abstract": "The field of cryptography has grown significantly with the advent of information and communication technologies due to the increasing complexity of cyber threats and rising security requirements. This evolution has come with the creation of new cryptosystems and improvements to current ones. This study is the first to explore the RSA approach in the framework of t-intuitionistic fuzzy subgroups. This technique makes group-based cryptographic operations safer when there are unclear relationships and hesitations. This supports the complex and uncertain nature of subgroup membership, allowing for much more significant representations of the degrees of belonging, non-belonging, and hesitancy for the group elements along parameter 't'. The t-intuitionistic fuzzy RSA technique employs a t-intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup to address cryptosystem ambiguity, fuzziness, and imprecision. Consequently, inaccurate cryptographic data is more effectively represented, manipulated, and protected. Furthermore, this technique enhances the current level of fuzzy cryptography. The t-intuitionistic fuzzy RSA algorithms are of theoretical and practical value, as they significantly contribute towards developing fuzzy cryptography, fuzzy algebraic structures, and decision support systems. In this paper, the notions of t-intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and triangular t-intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced. A new RSA cryptosystem based on a t-intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup is proposed in which the plaintext and the ciphertext are obtained in terms of t-intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and triangular t-intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In addition, the significance of the concept of the t-intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup is highlighted as a suitable alternative tool to secure the data under consideration. In addition, the practical effect of the proposed methods is also investigated in this study. A mathematical mechanism is presented to implement the t-intuitionistic fuzzy RSA algorithm. Finally, a comparative analysis of the developed technique is presented with some existing methods to showcase the applicability and superiority of the recently developed method.",

    "title": "Security evaluation and assurance of electronic health records.",
    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) maintain information of sensitive nature. Security requirements in this context are typically multilateral, encompassing the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders. Two main research questions arise from a security assurance point of view, namely how to demonstrate the internal correctness of EHRs and how to demonstrate their conformance in relation to multilateral security regulations. The above notions of correctness and conformance directly relate to the general concept of system verification, which asks the question \"are we building the system right?\" This should not be confused with the concept of system validation, which asks the question \"are we building the right system?\" Much of the research in the medical informatics community has been concerned with the latter aspect (validation). However, trustworthy security requires assurances that standards are followed and specifications are met. The objective of this paper is to contribute to filling this gap. We give an introduction to fundamentals of security assurance, summarize current assurance standards, and report on experiences with using security assurance methodology applied to the EHR domain, specifically focusing on case studies in the Canadian context.",

    "abstract": "In an era marked by pervasive digital connectivity, cybersecurity concerns have escalated. The rapid evolution of technology has led to a spectrum of cyber threats, including sophisticated zero-day attacks. This research addresses the challenge of existing intrusion detection systems in identifying zero-day attacks using the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset and autoencoders for anomaly detection. The trained autoencoder is integrated with XGBoost and Random Forest, resulting in the models XGBoost-AE and Random Forest-AE. The study demonstrates that incorporating an anomaly detector into traditional models significantly enhances performance. The Random Forest-AE model achieved 100% accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), outperforming the methods proposed by Balasubramanian et al., Khan, Mezina et al., Smith et al., and Dener et al. When tested on unseen data, the Random Forest-AE model achieved an accuracy of 99.9892%, precision of 100%, recall of 99.9803%, F1 score of 99.9901%, and MCC of 99.8313%. This research highlights the effectiveness of the proposed model in maintaining high accuracy even with previously unseen data.",

The applications of verifiable delay are also widespread in blockchain research, such as: computational timestamping, public random beacons, resource-efficient blockchains, and proofs of data replication. This paper introduces the concept of verifiable delay functions and systematically summarizes the types of verifiable delay functions. Firstly, the description and characteristics of verifiable delay functions are given, and weak verifiable delay functions, incremental verifiable delay functions, decodable verifiable delay functions, and trapdoor verifiable delay functions are introduced respectively. The construction of verifiable delay functions generally relies on two security assumptions: algebraic assumption or structural assumption. Then, the security assumptions of two different verifiable delay functions are described based on cryptography theory. Secondly, a post-quantum verifiable delay function based on super-singular isogeny is introduced. Finally, the paper summarizes the blockchain-related applications of verifiable delay functions.",

The main attack is a reader impersonation attack which allows an active adversary to impersonate a legitimate doctor, e.g. the patient's doctor, to access the patient's tag and change the patient prescription. The presented attack is quite efficient. To impersonate a doctor, the adversary should eavesdrop one session between the doctor and the patient's tag and then she can impersonate the doctor with the success probability of '1'. In addition, we present efficient reader-tag to back-end database impersonation, de-synchronization and traceability attacks against the protocol. Finally, we propose an improved version of protocol which is more efficient compared to the original protocol while provides the desired security against the presented attacks.",

Since healthcare applications are also being developed for mobile devices so that they also benefit from the power of social media, cybersecurity privacy concerns for such sensitive applications have become critical. This article discusses the architecture of a typical mobile healthcare application, in which customized privacy levels are defined for the individuals participating in the system. It then elaborates on how the communication across a social network in a multi-cloud environment can be made more secure and private, especially for healthcare applications.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things is a fast growing technology and a network of devices in which everything (smart objects or smart devices) are associated to the internet for effective exchange of information between these connected objects. Internet of Things (IoT) serves as a method for healthcare and acts as an essential part in broad range of real-time healthcare monitoring applications. Previous work shows networked sensor devices, either equipped on the body or embedded inside living being or a camera, make possible in gathering real-time information to evaluate physical and mental health state of the patient by collecting body temperature, blood pressure, patient's image, etc. Communicating this collected real-time data to the doctor, making accurate assessment on the data gathered and notifying the patient is challenging task in the IoT. The architechture of Internet of Things comprises of three layers, and it is the network of devices embedded with sensor, software, and electronics, enabling this device to communicate with each other and exchange data over a computer network. The IoT-based real-time healthcare systems are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks as the numbers of sensors are deployed in an unprotected network. These may even introduce the attacks, which cannot be monitored and controlled. This paper attempts to review the previous work done and a new scheme has been proposed, the new lightweight authentication protocol for smart real-time healthcare. The proposed scheme requires implementation with the authentication protocol. It is important to satisfy the major parameters of security: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and access control. In this paper our focus is on the authentication of devices.",

    "abstract": "Aggregating transcriptomics data across hospitals can increase sensitivity and robustness of differential expression analyses, yielding deeper clinical insights. As data exchange is often restricted by privacy legislation, meta-analyses are frequently employed to pool local results. However, the accuracy might drop if class labels are inhomogeneously distributed among cohorts. Flimma ( https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/flimma/ ) addresses this issue by implementing the state-of-the-art workflow limma voom in a federated manner, i.e., patient data never leaves its source site. Flimma results are identical to those generated by limma voom on aggregated datasets even in imbalanced scenarios where meta-analysis approaches fail.",

There are a number of traditional ways to address the expense and complexities of simplification, but none of them are bargains or beauties to behold: (1) Do-it-yourself encryption; (2) new back-end system purchases; (3) legacy system re-programming; or (4) onerous paper documentation. The good news is that 'second generation' e-health solutions are emerging that act as internal \"wrappers\" for health plan or provider data systems. They provide both an interface for end-users and a layer of security for organizational information and allow detailed patient-related data to remain at the system owner's physical location. These second generation solutions don't just 'connect,' data, they actually 'understand' the information, and can use data elements to invoke necessary rules, processing pathways, or personalization for specific stakeholders as required by HIPAA.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been considered as a potential solution for real-time monitoring applications and these WSNs have potential practical impact on next generation technology too. However, WSNs could become a threat if suitable security is not considered before the deployment and if there are any loopholes in their security, which might open the door for an attacker and hence, endanger the application. User authentication is one of the most important security services to protect WSN data access from unauthorized users; it should provide both mutual authentication and session key establishment services. This paper proposes a robust user authentication framework for wireless sensor networks, based on a two-factor (password and smart card) concept. This scheme facilitates many services to the users such as user anonymity, mutual authentication, secure session key establishment and it allows users to choose/update their password regularly, whenever needed. Furthermore, we have provided the formal verification using Rubin logic and compare RUASN with many existing schemes. As a result, we found that the proposed scheme possesses many advantages against popular attacks, and achieves better efficiency at low computation cost.",

    "abstract": "The European Union (EU) Data Protection Regulation will have profound implications for public health, health services research and statistics in Europe. The EU Commission's Proposal was a breakthrough in balancing privacy rights and rights to health and healthcare. The European Parliament, however, has proposed extensive amendments. This paper reviews the amendments proposed by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and their implications for health research and statistics. The amendments eliminate most innovations brought by the Proposal. Notably, derogation to the general prohibition of processing sensitive data shall be allowed for public interests such as the management of healthcare services,but not health research, monitoring, surveillance and governance. The processing of personal health data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes shall be allowed only with the consent of the data subject or if the processing serves an exceptionally high public interest, cannot be performed otherwise and is legally authorised. Research, be it academic, government,corporate or market research, falls under the same rule.The proposed amendments will make difficult or render impossible research and statistics involving the linkage and analysis of the wealth of data from clinical,administrative, insurance and survey sources, which have contributed to improving health outcomes and health systems performance and governance; and may illegitimise efforts that have been made in some European countries to enable privacy-respectful data use for research and statistical purposes. If the amendments stand as written, the right to privacy is likely to override the right to health and healthcare in Europe.",

In particular, the evolution of medical and IT convergence technology and mobile smart devices has made it possible for people to gather information on their health status anytime and anywhere easily using biometric information acquisition devices. Healthcare information systems can contribute to the improvement of the nation's healthcare quality and the reduction of related cost. However, there are no perfect security models or mechanisms for healthcare service applications, and privacy information can therefore be leaked. In this paper, we examine security requirements related to privacy protection in u-healthcare service and propose an extended RBAC based security model. We propose and design u-healthcare service integration platform (u-HCSIP) applying RBAC security model. The proposed u-HCSIP performs four main functions: storing and exchanging personal health records (PHR), recommending meals and exercise, buying/selling private health information or experience, and managing personal health data using smart devices.",

Authorized users can then efficiently access remote services provided by the medicine information systems through public networks. Guo and Chang recently improved the efficiency of a smartcard authentication and key agreement scheme by using chaotic maps. Later, Hao et al. reported that the scheme developed by Guo and Chang had two weaknesses: inability to provide anonymity and inefficient double secrets. Therefore, Hao et al. proposed an authentication scheme for telecare medicine information systems that solved these weaknesses and improved performance. However, a limitation in both schemes is their violation of the contributory property of key agreements. This investigation discusses these weaknesses and proposes a new smartcard-based authentication and key agreement scheme that uses chaotic maps for telecare medicine information systems. Compared to conventional schemes, the proposed scheme provides fewer weaknesses, better security, and more efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This article uses Deep Learning technologies to safeguard DNA sequencing against Bio-Cyber attacks. We consider a hybrid attack scenario where the payload is encoded into a DNA sequence to activate a Trojan malware implanted in a software tool used in the sequencing pipeline in order to allow the perpetrators to gain control over the resources used in that pipeline during sequence analysis. The scenario considered in the paper is based on perpetrators submitting synthetically engineered DNA samples that contain digitally encoded IP address and port number of the perpetrator's machine in the DNA. Genetic analysis of the sample's DNA will decode the address that is used by the software Trojan malware to activate and trigger a remote connection. This approach can open up to multiple perpetrators to create connections to hijack the DNA sequencing pipeline. As a way of hiding the data, the perpetrators can avoid detection by encoding the address to maximise similarity with genuine DNAs, which we showed previously. However, in this paper we show how Deep Learning can be used to successfully detect and identify the trigger encoded data, in order to protect a DNA sequencing pipeline from Trojan attacks. The result shows nearly up to 100% accuracy in detection in such a novel Trojan attack scenario even after applying fragmentation encryption and steganography on the encoded trigger data. In addition, feasibility of designing and synthesizing encoded DNA for such Trojan payloads is validated by a wet lab experiment.",

    "title": "SAFETY: Secure gwAs in Federated Environment through a hYbrid Solution.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that effective healthcare can benefit from using the human genomic information. Consequently, many institutions are using statistical analysis of genomic data, which are mostly based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS analyze genome sequence variations in order to identify genetic risk factors for diseases. These studies often require pooling data from different sources together in order to unravel statistical patterns, and relationships between genetic variants and diseases. Here, the primary challenge is to fulfill one major objective: accessing multiple genomic data repositories for collaborative research in a privacy-preserving manner. Due to the privacy concerns regarding the genomic data, multi-jurisdictional laws and policies of cross-border genomic data sharing are enforced among different countries. In this article, we present SAFETY, a hybrid framework, which can securely perform GWAS on federated genomic datasets using homomorphic encryption and recently introduced secure hardware component of Intel Software Guard Extensions to ensure high efficiency and privacy at the same time. Different experimental settings show the efficacy and applicability of such hybrid framework in secure conduction of GWAS. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid use of homomorphic encryption along with Intel SGX is not proposed to this date. SAFETY is up to 4.82 times faster than the best existing secure computation technique.",

    "abstract": "One of the results of the 49th Bavarian Physician's Conference was that in 1996 the Bavarian Statutory Health Care Administration (Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Bayerns, KVB) and the Bavarian Medical Association (Bayerische Landesärztekammer, BLAK) jointly suggested a project for the development and verification of a security infrastructure for the online transmission of medical patient data. This Project, the so-called \"Health Care Professionals Protocol\" (HCP-Protokoll), was designed to establish the first consensus standard for a secure and probably open system to be used in the health care system operating under the constraints of the diverse and heterogeneous IT-infrastructure in Bavaria, with a view towards utilization in all of Germany. In January 1997, the HCP-Protocol was accepted as the strategic mainline project for telematics applications in medicine by the State of Bavaria and endowed with more than 1.3 million DM in the framework of \"Bavaria Online II\". In the meantime, various national organizations of the German medical community as well as important industrial partners have expressed support for this initiative. Mention in the Roland-Berger study \"Telematics in Health Care, Perspectives of Telemedicine in Germany\", designation as an \"exemplary scenario\" in the final report of the Working Group 7 of the Forum Info 2000 \"Telematics Applications in Health Care\", as well as integration of the new German health professional card, make the HCP-Protocol the most promising candidate for a de facto standard in the security infrastructure for all participants in health care telecommunication in Germany. Since the middle of 1998, an expert group under the guidance of the joint \"Projektbüro Telemedizin\" of the KVB and BLAK has been working on the definition of this protocol, taking into consideration the current legal framework of the German medical profession (Berufsordnung), the German signature law (SigG), and the national data security laws (BDSG), as well as today's technical possibilities and existing components. The results of this definition will be published at the first opportunity (sometime during the first half of 1999) and then placed into public domain, so that any solution provider can reference this source to create secure and mutually interoperable application programs for health care professionals in Germany.",

    "abstract": "Successful cyber-attacks are caused by the exploitation of some vulnerabilities in the software and/or hardware that exist in systems deployed in premises or the cloud. Although hundreds of vulnerabilities are discovered every year, only a small fraction of them actually become exploited, thereby there exists a severe class imbalance between the number of exploited and non-exploited vulnerabilities. The open source national vulnerability database, the largest repository to index and maintain all known vulnerabilities, assigns a unique identifier to each vulnerability. Each registered vulnerability also gets a severity score based on the impact it might inflict upon if compromised. Recent research works showed that the cvss score is not the only factor to select a vulnerability for exploitation, and other attributes in the national vulnerability database can be effectively utilized as predictive feature to predict the most exploitable vulnerabilities. Since cybersecurity management is highly resource savvy, organizations such as cloud systems will benefit when the most likely exploitable vulnerabilities that exist in their system software or hardware can be predicted with as much accuracy and reliability as possible, to best utilize the available resources to fix those first. Various existing research works have developed vulnerability exploitation prediction models by addressing the existing class imbalance based on algorithmic and artificial data resampling techniques but still suffer greatly from the overfitting problem to the major class rendering them practically unreliable. In this research, we have designed a novel cost function feature to address the existing class imbalance. We also have utilized the available large text corpus in the extracted dataset to develop a custom-trained word vector that can better capture the context of the local text data for utilization as an embedded layer in neural networks. Our developed vulnerability exploitation prediction models powered by a novel cost function and custom-trained word vector have achieved very high overall performance metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC score with values of 0.92, 0.89, 0.98, 0.94 and 0.97, respectively, thereby outperforming any existing models while successfully overcoming the existing overfitting problem for class imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties to grow a shared secret key. Its security is founded on the principles of quantum mechanics, but in reality it significantly relies on the physical implementation. Technological imperfections of QKD systems have been previously explored, but no attack on an established QKD connection has been realized so far. Here we show the first full-field implementation of a complete attack on a running QKD connection. An installed eavesdropper obtains the entire 'secret' key, while none of the parameters monitored by the legitimate parties indicate a security breach. This confirms that non-idealities in physical implementations of QKD can be fully practically exploitable, and must be given increased scrutiny if quantum cryptography is to become highly secure.",

    "abstract": "The sharing of patients' locations is an important part in mobile medical services and modern smart healthcare. Although location sharing based on blockchains has advantages on decentralization and openness, there is also a challenge to guarantee the security and the privacy of locations recorded in a blockchain. To this end, this paper investigates the location sharing based on blockchains for telecare medical information systems. Firstly, we define the basic requirements of blockchain-based location sharing including decentralization, unforgeability, confidentiality, multi-level privacy protection, retrievability and verifiability. Then, using order-preserving encryption and merkle tree, we propose a blockchain-based multi-level location sharing scheme, i.e. BMPLS. The analysis results show that our scheme satisfies the above requirements. Finally, the performance of our scheme is evaluated and the experiment results show that our scheme is efficient and feasible for both patients and medical workers. In a word, our scheme can be applied to realize privacy-preserving location sharing based on blockchains for telecare medical information systems.",

    "abstract": "Digital signature is an important cryptography technology to be used to provide integrity and non-repudiation in electronic medical record systems (EMRS) and it is required by law. However, digital signatures normally appear in forms unrecognizable to medical staff, this may reduce the trust from medical staff that is used to the handwritten signatures or seals. Therefore, in this paper we propose a dual function seal to extend user trust from a traditional seal to a digital signature. The proposed dual function seal is a prototype that combines the traditional seal and digital seal. With this prototype, medical personnel are not just can put a seal on paper but also generate a visualized digital signature for electronic medical records. Medical Personnel can then look at the visualized digital signature and directly know which medical personnel generated it, just like with a traditional seal. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used as an image processing method to generate a visualized digital signature, and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is calculated to verify that distortions of all converted images are beyond human recognition, and the results of our converted images are from 70 dB to 80 dB. The signature recoverability is also tested in this proposed paper to ensure that the visualized digital signature is verifiable. A simulated EMRS is implemented to show how the visualized digital signature can be integrity into EMRS.",

Electronic data formats can improve performance of core public health functions, but potentially threaten privacy because they can be easily duplicated and transmitted to unauthorized people. Although such security breaches do occur, electronic data can be better secured than paper records, because authentication, authorization, auditing, and accountability can be facilitated. Public health professionals should collaborate with law and information technology colleagues to assess possible threats, implement updated policies, train staff, and develop preventive engineering measures to protect information. Tightened physical and electronic controls can prevent misuse of data, minimize the risk of security breaches, and help maintain the reputation and integrity of public health agencies.",

This paper first presents a structured security analysis, based on which we then design, implement, and evaluate a trustworthy and efficient randomness beacon.

These algorithms assume rational human behavior. However, human behavior in an online game designed to simulate an insider attack scenario shows that humans, playing the role of attackers, attack far more often than predicted under perfect rationality. We describe an instance-based learning cognitive model, built in ACT-R, that accurately predicts human performance and biases in the game. To improve defenses, we propose an adaptive method of signaling that uses the cognitive model to trace an individual's experience in real time. We discuss the results and implications of this adaptive signaling method for personalized defense.",

However, in the UK in particular, the practice of collecting data, tissues or even whole organs has recently come under the spotlight of public scrutiny, particularly following the Alder Hey Enquiry.

In this paper, we review several proposed WSN user authentication protocols, with a detailed review of the M.L Das protocol and a cryptanalysis of Das' protocol that shows several security weaknesses. Furthermore, this paper proposes an ECC-based user authentication protocol that resolves these weaknesses. According to our analysis of security of the ECC-based protocol, it is suitable for applications with higher security requirements. Finally, we present a comparison of security, computation, and communication costs and performances for the proposed protocols.

    "title": "Cyber-Internet Security Framework to Conquer Energy-Related Attacks on the Internet of Things with Machine Learning Techniques.",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) ushers in a new era of communication that depends on a broad range of things and many types of communication technologies to share information. This new age of communication will be characterised by the following characteristics: Because all of the IoT's objects are connected to one another and because they function in environments that are not protected, it poses a significantly greater number of issues, constraints, and challenges than do traditional computing systems. This is due to the fact that traditional computing systems do not have as many interconnected components. Because of this, it is imperative that security be prioritised in a new approach, which is not something that is currently present in conventional computer systems. The Wireless Sensor Network, often known as WSN, and the Mobile Ad hoc Network are two technologies that play significant roles in the process of building an Internet of Things system. These technologies are used in a wide variety of activities, including sensing, environmental monitoring, data collecting, heterogeneous communication techniques, and data processing, amongst others. Because it incorporates characteristics of both MANET and WSN, IoT is susceptible to the same kinds of security issues that affect those other networks. An assault known as a Delegate Entity Attack (DEA) is a subclass of an attack known as a Denial of Service (DoS). The attacker sends an unacceptable number of control packets that have the appearance of being authentic. DoS assaults may take many different forms, and one of those kinds is an SD attack. Because of this, it is far more difficult to recognise this form of attack than a simple one that depletes the battery's capacity. One of the other key challenges that arise in a network during an SD attack is that there is the need to enhance energy management and prolong the lifespan of IoT nodes. This is one of the other significant issues that arise in a network when an SD attack is occurs. It is recommended that you make use of a Random Number Generator with Hierarchical Intrusion Detection System, abbreviated as RNGHID for short. The ecosystem of the Internet of Things is likely to be segmented into a great number of separate sectors and clusters. The HIPS system has been partitioned into two entities, which are referred to as the Delegate Entity (DE) and the Pivotal Entity, in order to identify any nodes in the network that are behaving in an abnormal manner. These entities are known, respectively, as the Delegate Entity and the Pivotal Entity (PE). Once the anomalies have been identified, it will be possible to pinpoint the area of the SD attack torture and the damaging activities that have been taken place. A warning message, generated by the Malicious Node Alert System (MNAS), is broadcast across the network in order to inform the other nodes that the network is under attack. This message classifies the various sorts of attacks based on the results of an algorithm that employs machine learning. The proposed protocol displays various desired properties, such as the capacity to conduct indivisible authentication, rapid authentication, and minimum overhead in both transmission and storage. These are only a few of the desirable attributes.",

However, with the integration of external networks and the vehicle networks, the vulnerabilities of the Controller Area Network (CAN) are exposed, allowing attackers to remotely invade vehicle networks through external devices. Based on the remote attack model for vulnerabilities of the in-vehicle CAN, we designed an efficient and safe identity authentication scheme based on Feige-Fiat-Shamir (FFS) zero-knowledge identification scheme with extremely high soundness. We used the method of zero-one reversal and two-to-one verification to solve the problem that FFS cannot effectively resist guessing attacks. Then, we carried out a theoretical analysis of the scheme's security and evaluated it on the software and hardware platform. Finally, regarding time overhead, under the same parameters, compared with the existing scheme, the scheme can complete the authentication within 6.1ms without having to go through multiple rounds of interaction, which reduces the additional authentication delay and enables all private keys to participate in one round of authentication, thereby eliminating the possibility that a private key may not be involved in the original protocol. Regarding security and soundness, as long as private keys are not cracked, the scheme can resist guessing attacks, which is more secure than the existing scheme.",

Attention is drawn to the improvement of the collection and dissemination of knowledge in addition to the analysis of morbid conditions as a focus for health informatics. On this basis a review of the current state of health information systems is undertaken. The importance of adaptable user interfaces for end users and systems personnel, privacy and confidentiality protection, and linkage among clinical support systems and knowledge repositories is stressed. These improvements hinge on advancements in medical concept representation. Canadian contributions to these developments, particularly the instigation of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) are briefly reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The proper management of drug treatment is essential, since adverse drug reactions are common reasons of hospitalisations. Expenditure on drug therapy has also been growing faster than any other aspect of health care in many countries. Savings and quality improvements in drug treatment could be achieved with computerised prescribing. In this paper, the architecture of an electronic prescription system is described in the light of software certification and registration. An electronic prescription system is an example of a system supporting shared care and therefore it should be person based, integrated, secure and confidential and data should be shared among health care institutions. The system architecture shares the idea of a virtual patient record and a smart card will be used as a key to prescription data located on the network. The certification and registration of medical software is a difficult and costly procedure. Ensuring the quality of software can be based on; certification of development process, voluntary evaluation, and post-market surveillance. Voluntary evaluation practice would be a precious tool for both the customers and software developers, and it would also be an invaluable source of information in terms of developing new software.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of an adversary's behavior on the defender's accurate and timely detection of network threats. Cyber attacks cause major work disruption. It is important to understand how a defender's behavior (experience and tolerance to threats), as well as adversarial behavior (attack strategy), might impact the detection of threats. In this article, we use cognitive modeling to make predictions regarding these factors. Different model types representing a defender, based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), faced different adversarial behaviors. A defender's model was defined by experience of threats: threat-prone (90% threats and 10% nonthreats) and nonthreat-prone (10% threats and 90% nonthreats); and different tolerance levels to threats: risk-averse (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving one threat out of eight total) and risk-seeking (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving seven threats out of eight total). Adversarial behavior is simulated by considering different attack strategies: patient (threats occur late) and impatient (threats occur early). For an impatient strategy, risk-averse models with threat-prone experiences show improved detection compared with risk-seeking models with nonthreat-prone experiences; however, the same is not true for a patient strategy. Based upon model predictions, a defender's prior threat experiences and his or her tolerance to threats are likely to predict detection accuracy; but considering the nature of adversarial behavior is also important. Decision-support tools that consider the role of a defender's experience and tolerance to threats along with the nature of adversarial behavior are likely to improve a defender's overall threat detection.",

But SMS text messaging is unencrypted, insecure, and does not meet HIPAA requirements. In addition, the short and abbreviated nature of text messages creates opportunities for misinterpretation, and can negatively impact patient safety and care. Until recently, asking patients to sign a statement that they understand and accept these risks--as well as having policies, device encryption, and cyber insurance in place--would have been enough to mitigate the risk of using SMS text in a medical practice. But new trends and policies have made SMS text messaging unsafe under any circumstance.

However, its critical role and sensitive data make it a prime target for cyber threats, requiring the implementation of effective security solutions. This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) specifically designed for IoMT networks. The proposed IDS leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, employing a stacking ensemble method to enhance detection accuracy by integrating the strengths of multiple classifiers. To ensure real-time performance, the IDS is implemented within a Kappa Architecture framework, enabling continuous processing of IoMT data streams. The system effectively detects and classifies a wide range of cyberattacks, including ARP spoofing, DoS, Smurf, and Port Scan, achieving an outstanding detection accuracy of 0.991 in binary classification and 0.993 in multi-class classification. This research highlights the potential of combining advanced ML and DL methods with ensemble learning to address the unique cybersecurity challenges of IoMT systems, providing a reliable and scalable solution for safeguarding healthcare services.",

    "title": "Item Anomaly Detection Based on Dynamic Partition for Time Series in Recommender Systems.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems have become an effective method to process information overload. However, recommendation technology still suffers from many problems. One of the problems is shilling attacks-attackers inject spam user profiles to disturb the list of recommendation items. There are two characteristics of all types of shilling attacks: 1) Item abnormality: The rating of target items is always maximum or minimum; and 2) Attack promptness: It takes only a very short period time to inject attack profiles. Some papers have proposed item anomaly detection methods based on these two characteristics, but their detection rate, false alarm rate, and universality need to be further improved. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an item anomaly detection method based on dynamic partitioning for time series. This method first dynamically partitions item-rating time series based on important points. Then, we use chi square distribution (χ2) to detect abnormal intervals. The experimental results on MovieLens 100K and 1M indicate that this approach has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate and is stable toward different attack models and filler sizes.",

Data sharing enabled the health care policy makers to make decisions based on real-time data, it enabled the tracking of the virus, and importantly it enabled the development of vaccines that were crucial to mitigating the impact of the virus. This data sharing is not the norm as data sharing needs to navigate complex ethical and legal rules, and in particular, the fragmented application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The introduction of the draft regulation for a European Health Data Space (EHDS) in May 2022 seeks to address some of these legal issues. If passed, it will create an obligation to share electronic health data for certain secondary purposes. While there is a clear need to address the legal complexities involved with data sharing, it is critical that any proposed reforms are in line with ethical principles and the expectations of the data subjects. In this paper we offer a critique of the EHDS and offer some recommendations for this evolving regulatory space.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of 5G and 6G networks has enhanced the ability of massive IoT devices to provide real-time monitoring and interaction with the surrounding environment. Despite recent advances, the necessary security services, such as immediate and continuous authentication, high scalability, and cybersecurity handling of IoT cannot be achieved in a single broadcast authentication protocol. This paper presents a new hybrid protocol called Hybrid Two-level µ-timed-efficient stream loss-tolerant authentication (Hybrid TLI-µTESLA) protocol, which maximizes the benefits of the previous TESLA protocol variants, including scalability support and immediate authentication of Multilevel-µTESLA protocol and continuous authentication with minimal computation overhead of enhanced Inf-TESLA protocol. The inclusion of three different keychains and checking criteria of the packets in the Hybrid TLI-µTESLA protocol enabled resistance against Masquerading, Modification, Man-in-the-Middle, Brute-force, and DoS attacks. A solution for the authentication problem in the first and last packets of the high-level and low-level keychains of the Multilevel-µTESLA protocol was also proposed. The simulation analysis was performed using Java, where we compared the Hybrid TLI-µTESLA protocol with other variants for time complexity and computation overhead at the sender and receiver sides. We also conducted a comparative analysis between two hash functions, SHA-2 and SHA-3, and assessed the feasibility of the proposed protocol in the forthcoming 6G technology. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed protocol over other variants in terms of immediate and continuous authentication, scalability, cybersecurity, lifetime, network performance, and compatibility with 5G and 6G IoT generations.",

To test the Secure Medical Image Information System, a series of medical data transmission were conducted from A Coruña (Spain) to the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, situated 1,000 km away, in Granada (Spain). Once we studied the networking infrastructure of the hospital and its available image generation devices, we subsequently carried out a series of measurements during the transmissions, which allowed us to analyze the behavior of the system with different network schemes and connection speeds. The results obtained from these investigations demonstrate that the impact of secure data-sending methods on the productivity of the system is higher in networks whose capacities are higher and it is not affected by sending data during different periods in the day. In this regard, the presented approach may serve as a model for other small, and possibly mid-sized, medical centers.",

We conducted an intensive literature search on current or emerging AI and autonomous technologies (eg, vehicles), military and medical technologies (eg, surgical robots), relevant frameworks and standards, cyber security/safety- and legal-systems worldwide. We provide a discussion on unique challenges for robotic surgery faced by proposals made for AI more generally (eg, Explainable AI) and machine learning more specifically (eg, black box), as well as recommendations for developing and improving relevant frameworks or standards. We classify responsibility into the following: (1) Accountability; (2) Liability; and (3) Culpability. All three aspects were addressed when discussing responsibility for AI and autonomous surgical robots, be these civil or military patients (however, these aspects may require revision in cases where robots become citizens). The component which produces the least clarity is Culpability, since it is unthinkable in the current state of technology. We envision that in the near future a surgical robot can learn and perform routine operative tasks that can then be supervised by a human surgeon. This represents a surgical parallel to autonomously driven vehicles. Here a human remains in the 'driving seat' as a 'doctor-in-the-loop' thereby safeguarding patients undergoing operations that are supported by surgical machines with autonomous capabilities.",

With the increasing complexity of cyber breaches and budgetary issues, prioritizing which locations require the most immediate attention by top management through a data-driven model is more important than ever. Using CORAS threat modeling and five methods for multi-criteria decision-making, these locations were ranked from greatest to least risk of data breaches. Statistical methods were subsequently used for consistency and robustness checks. The findings illustrate that each type of covered entity under HIPAA must prioritize a different set of locations to safeguard first: health care providers must focus on the security of network servers, other portable electronic devices, and category of others (i.e., miscellaneous locations); health plans must focus on the security of paper and films, network servers, and others; and business associates must focus on the security of category of others, network servers, and other portable electronic devices. Combined with data on the source of the breaches (external vs. internal) and type of threats (e.g., hacking, theft), these findings provide recommendations for risk identification for privacy officers across health care.",

    "abstract": "The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes legal responsibilities concerning the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the EU. It has particular implications for the remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). This report from a joint Task Force of the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Regulatory Affairs Committee of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends a common legal interpretation of the GDPR. Manufacturers and hospitals should be designated as joint controllers of the data collected by remote monitoring (depending upon the system architecture) and they should have a mutual contract in place that defines their respective roles; a generic template is proposed. Alternatively, they may be two independent controllers. Self-employed cardiologists also are data controllers. Third-party providers of monitoring platforms may act as data processors. Manufacturers should always collect and process the minimum amount of identifiable data necessary, and wherever feasible have access only to pseudonymized data. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities have been reported concerning the security of transmission of data between a patient's device and the transceiver, so manufacturers should use secure communication protocols. Patients need to be informed how their remotely monitored data will be handled and used, and their informed consent should be sought before their device is implanted. Review of consent forms in current use revealed great variability in length and content, and sometimes very technical language; therefore, a standard information sheet and generic consent form are proposed. Cardiologists who care for patients with CIEDs that are remotely monitored should be aware of these issues.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine how monetary motivations influence decision making of humans performing as security analysts and hackers in a cybersecurity game. Cyberattacks are increasing at an alarming rate. As cyberattacks often cause damage to existing cyber infrastructures, it is important to understand how monetary rewards may influence decision making of hackers and analysts in the cyber world. Currently, only limited attention has been given to this area. In an experiment, participants were randomly assigned to three between-subjects conditions ( n = 26 for each condition): equal payoff, where the magnitude of monetary rewards for hackers and defenders was the same; rewarding hacker, where the magnitude of monetary reward for hacker's successful attack was 10 times the reward for analyst's successful defense; and rewarding analyst, where the magnitude of monetary reward for analyst's successful defense was 10 times the reward for hacker's successful attack. In all conditions, half of the participants were human hackers playing against Nash analysts and half were human analysts playing against Nash hackers. Results revealed that monetary rewards for human hackers and analysts caused a decrease in attack and defend actions compared with the baseline. Furthermore, rewarding human hackers for undetected attacks made analysts deviate significantly from their optimal behavior. If hackers are rewarded for their undetected attack actions, then this causes analysts to deviate from optimal defend proportions. Thus, analysts need to be trained not become overenthusiastic in defending networks. Applications of our results are to networks where the influence of monetary rewards may cause information theft and system damage.",

    "abstract": "False alerts due to misconfigured or compromised intrusion detection systems (IDS) in industrial control system (ICS) networks can lead to severe economic and operational damage. However, research using deep learning to reduce false alerts often requires the physical and cyber sensor data to be trustworthy. Implicit trust is a major problem for artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) in cyber-physical system (CPS) security, because when these solutions are most urgently needed is also when they are most at risk (e.g., during an attack). To address this, the Inter-Domain Evidence theoretic Approach for Inference (IDEA-I) is proposed that reframes the detection problem as how to make good decisions given uncertainty. Specifically, an evidence theoretic approach leveraging Dempster-Shafer (DS) combination rules and their variants is proposed for reducing false alerts. A multi-hypothesis mass function model is designed that leverages probability scores obtained from supervised-learning classifiers. Using this model, a location-cum-domain-based fusion framework is proposed to evaluate the detector's performance using disjunctive, conjunctive, and cautious conjunctive rules. The approach is demonstrated in a cyber-physical power system testbed, and the classifiers are trained with datasets from Man-In-The-Middle attack emulation in a large-scale synthetic electric grid. For evaluating the performance, we consider plausibility, belief, pignistic, and general Bayesian theorem-based metrics as decision functions. To improve the performance, a multi-objective-based genetic algorithm is proposed for feature selection considering the decision metrics as the fitness function. Finally, we present a software application to evaluate the DS fusion approaches with different parameters and architectures.",

We give an overview of the current state of multimedia authenticity protection, including the requirements of various multimedia applications, current approaches to the problem, and the robustness of the approaches. For watermark security, a covert independent-component watermarking signal can serve as a 'vaccination' against a dormant digital 'bacteria' protecting the multimedia data. An unauthorized removal of the watermark triggers the bacteria payload, which then degrades the quality of the unauthorized data. We argue that such digital bacteria meet all the established requirements for beneficial virus-like programs, and their payload would merely affect pirated media. We show how these new approaches contribute to a flexible, robust, and secure system for protecting the authenticity of multimedia products.",

    "title": "A cost-effective add-on-value card-assisted firewall over Taiwan's NHI VPN framework.",
    "abstract": "Besides the overall budget for building the infrastructure of a healthcare-service-based virtual private network (VPN) in Taiwan, two issues were considered critical for its acceptance by the country's 17,000 plus medical institutions. One was who was to pay for the network (ADSL or modem) connection fee; the other was who was to pay for the firewall/anti-virus software. This paper addresses the second issue by proposing an efficient freeware firewall, named card-assisted firewall (CAF), for NHI VPN edge-hosts, which is also an add-on-value application of the National Healthcare IC card that every insurant and medical professional has. The innovative concept is that any NHI VPN site (edge-host) can establish diversified secure-authenticated connections with other sites only by an authentication mechanism, which requires a NHI Java card state machine and the Access Control List of the host. It is different from two-factor authentication cards in four ways: (1) a PIN code is not a must; (2) it requires authentication with the remote IC card Data Centre; (3) the NHI cards are already available, no modification is needed, and there is no further cost for the deployment of the cards; (4) although the cards are in the reader, the communication cannot start unless the cards are in the corresponding states; i.e. the states allow communication. An implementation, on a Microsoft Windows XP platform, demonstrated the system's feasibility over an emulation of the NHI VPN framework. It maintained a high line speed, the driver took up 39 KB of disk space, installation was simple, not requiring any extra hardware or software, and the average packet processing time of the CAF driver measured was 0.3084 ms. The average overhead in comparing the Access Control List predefined routing in card, in an FTP testing experiment, was 5.7 micros (receiving) and 8 micros (sending).",

Trust management solutions that have being around now for some fifteen years were primarily developed for the above mentioned cyber environments and they are typically focused on artificial agents, sensors, etc. However, this paper presents extensions of a new methodology together with architecture for trust management support that is focused on humans and human-like agents. With this methodology and architecture sensors play a crucial role. The architecture presents an already deployable tool for multi and interdisciplinary research in various areas where humans are involved. It provides new ways to obtain an insight into dynamics and evolution of such structures, not only in pervasive computing environments, but also in other important areas like management and decision making support.",

The EU-AIM-SEISMED project has attacked this challenge. There is consensus that legal regulations and organisational measures around health care IT-systems have to be revisited and harmonised. However, the increasing processing capacities of IT-systems demand that the legitimate security interests of users and usees are enforced in advance--not only after the fact. This cannot be achieved against -----stems but only by the help of IT-systems. Since cryptographic mechanisms are an essential tool to this end SEISMED provides guidelines and technical recommendations on cryptographic mechanisms.",

The proposed solution gives access to the outcomes of the image integrity and of its origins as its attachment to one patient even if the image is stored encrypted. In this study, the given solution combines the RC4 stream cipher and two substitutive watermarking modulations: the Least Significant Bit Method and the Quantization Index Modulation. If watermarking and encryption are conducted jointly at the protection stage, watermark extraction and decryption can be applied independently. Experimental results achieved on 8 bits encoded echographic images illustrate the overall performances of the proposed scheme. At least, a capacity rate of 1 and 0.5 bits of message per pixel of image can be embedded in the spatial and the encrypted domains respectively, with a peak signal to noise ratio greater than 49 dB.",

The highlight of SmartMal is to introduce service-oriented architecture (SOA) concepts and behavior analysis into the malware detection paradigms. The proposed framework relies on client-server architecture, the client continuously extracts various features and transfers them to the server, and the server's main task is to detect anomalies using state-of-art detection algorithms. Multiple distributed servers simultaneously analyze the feature vector using various detectors and information fusion is used to concatenate the results of detectors. We also propose a cycle-based statistical approach for mobile device anomaly detection. We accomplish this by analyzing the users' regular usage patterns. Empirical results suggest that the proposed framework and novel anomaly detection algorithm are highly effective in detecting malware on Android devices.",

However, users' concern about the security and privacy of their health information has become one of the major obstacles that impede the wide adoption of WBANs. Anonymous and unlinkable authentication is critical to protect the security and privacy of sensitive physiological information in transit from the client to the application provider. We first show that the anonymous authentication scheme of Wang and Zhang based on bilinear pairing is prone to client impersonation attack. Then, we propose an enhanced anonymous authentication scheme to remedy the flaw in Wang and Zhang's scheme. We give the security analysis to demonstrate that the enhanced scheme achieves the desired security features and withstands various known attacks.",

    "title": "Simulating the overload of medical processes due to system failures during a cyberattack.",
    "abstract": "Today's medical IT is more and more connected and network or IT system outages may impact the quality of patient treatment. IT outages from cyberattacks are particularly worrisome if attackers focus on those medical IT devices that are critical for medical processes. However, medical processes are primarily documented for the hospital employees and not for analyzing the criticality of any given human or medical IT resource. This paper presents a generic model for realistic, patient-focused simulation of medical processes. The model allows the simulation of cyber incidents, focusing on device outages or overload situations like mass casualty incidents. Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept tool that implements the described model, enabling end-users to simulate their processes. The tool offers the ability to run with low detailed data for overview purposes and highly detailed data for fine-grained simulation results. We perform different scenario simulations for a sample hospital, including the acute phase of a ransomware attack, negative performance impacts due to the implementation of cybersecurity measures, and emergency plans for mass casualty incidents. In each scenario, the respective simulation resulted in a quantitative statement of how these scenarios affect overall process performance and show possible key factors supporting decision-making. We use real-world data from a German trauma room to optimize and evaluate the process simulation.",

    "abstract": "The digitization of patient health information (PHI) for wireless health monitoring systems (WHMSs) has brought many benefits and challenges for both patients and physicians. However, security, privacy and robustness have remained important challenges for WHMSs. Since the patient's PHI is sensitive and the communication channel, i.e., the Internet, is insecure, it is important to protect them against unauthorized entities, i.e., attackers. Otherwise, failure to do so will not only lead to the compromise of a patient's privacy, but will also put his/her life at risk. This paper proposes a freshness-preserving non-interactive hierarchical key agreement protocol (FNKAP) for WHMSs. The FNKAP is based on the concept of the non-interactive identity-based key agreement for communication efficiency. It achieves patient anonymity between a patient and physician, session key secrecy and resistance against various security attacks, especially including replay attacks.",

Firstly, by employing the signed graph theory, the mathematical model of coupled QVNNs with structurally-balanced cooperative-competitive interactions is established. Secondly, by adopting non-decomposition method and constructing a suitable unitary Lyapunov functional, the bipartite secure synchronization (BSS) criteria for coupled QVNNs are obtained in the form of quaternion-valued LMIs. It is essential to mention that the structurally-balanced topology is relatively strong, hence, the coupled QVNNs with structurally-unbalanced graph are further studied. The structurally-unbalanced graph is treated as an interruption of the structurally-balanced graph, the bipartite secure quasi-synchronization (BSQS) criteria for coupled QVNNs with structurally-unbalanced graph are derived. Finally, two simulations are given to illustrate the feasibility of the suggested BSS and BSQS approaches.",

    "abstract": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) provides a medium through which physiological information could be harvested and transmitted to application provider (AP) in real time. Integrating WBAN in a heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem would enable an AP to monitor patients from anywhere and at anytime. However, the IoT roadmap of interconnected 'Things' is still faced with many challenges. One of the challenges in healthcare is security and privacy of streamed medical data from heterogeneously networked devices. In this paper, we first propose a heterogeneous signcryption scheme where a sender is in a certificateless cryptographic (CLC) environment while a receiver is in identity-based cryptographic (IBC) environment. We then use this scheme to design a heterogeneous access control protocol. Formal security proof for indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model is presented. In comparison with some of the existing access control schemes, our scheme has lower computation and communication cost.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack reveals a potential imperfection in deep models that they are susceptible to being tricked by imperceptible perturbations added to images. Recent deep multi-object trackers combine the functionalities of detection and association, rendering attacks on either the detector or the association component an effective means of deception. Existing attacks focus on increasing the frequency of ID switching, which greatly damages tracking stability, but is not enough to make the tracker completely ineffective. To fully explore the potential of adversarial attacks, we propose Blind-Blur Attack (BBA), a novel attack method based on spatio-temporal motion information to fool multi-object trackers. Specifically, a simple but efficient perturbation generator is trained with the blind-blur loss, simultaneously making the target invisible to the tracker and letting the background be regarded as moving targets. We take TraDeS as our main research tracker, and verify our attack method on other excellent algorithms (i.e., CenterTrack, FairMOT, and ByteTrack) on MOT-Challenge benchmark datasets (i.e., MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20). BBA attack reduced the MOTA of TraDeS and ByteTrack from 69.1 and 80.3 to -238.1 and -357.0, respectively, indicating that it is an efficient method with a high degrees of transferability.",

    "abstract": "In a remote user authentication scheme, a remote server verifies whether a login user is genuine and trustworthy, and also for mutual authentication purpose a login user validates whether the remote server is genuine and trustworthy. Several remote user authentication schemes using the password, the biometrics, and the smart card have been proposed in the literature. However, most schemes proposed in the literature are either computationally expensive or insecure against several known attacks. In this paper, we aim to propose a new robust and effective password-based remote user authentication scheme using smart card. Our scheme is efficient, because our scheme uses only efficient one-way hash function and bitwise XOR operations. Through the rigorous informal and formal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. We perform the simulation for the formal security analysis using the widely accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to ensure that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks. Furthermore, our scheme supports efficiently the password change phase always locally without contacting the remote server and correctly. In addition, our scheme performs significantly better than other existing schemes in terms of communication, computational overheads, security, and features provided by our scheme.",

In this study, public perceptions of biobanks and collection of genetic and health data were analyzed in relation to other technologies and digital networks where personal information is compiled and distributed. In this setting, people contextualized biobanks in line with their daily experiences with other technologies and data streams. The analysis was based on 18 focus group discussions conducted in Austria, Finland and Germany. We examined the ways in which people frame and talk about problems and benefits of information distribution in digital networks and biobanks. People identify many challenges associated with collection of personal data in the information society. The study showed that instead of privacy - which has been the key term of bioethical debates on biobanks - the notions of control and controllability are most essential for people. From the viewpoint of biobanks, issues of controllability pose challenges. In the information society, people have become accustomed to controlling personal data, which is particularly difficult in relation to biobanks. They expressed strong concerns over the controllability of the goals and benefits of biobanks.",

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection plays a significant role in the provision of information security. The most critical element is the ability to precisely identify different types of intrusions into the network. However, the detection of intrusions poses a important challenge, as many new types of intrusion are now generated by cyber-attackers every day. A robust system is still elusive, despite the various strategies that have been proposed in recent years. Hence, a novel deep-learning-based architecture for detecting intrusions into a computer network is proposed in this paper. The aim is to construct a hybrid system that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection. The main contribution of our work is a novel deep learning-based hybrid architecture in which PSO is used for hyperparameter optimisation and three well-known pre-trained network models are combined in an optimised way. The suggested method involves six key stages: data gathering, pre-processing, deep neural network (DNN) architecture design, optimisation of hyperparameters, training, and evaluation of the trained DNN. To verify the superiority of the suggested method over alternative state-of-the-art schemes, it was evaluated on the KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Our empirical findings show that the proposed model successfully and correctly classifies different types of attacks with 82.44%, 90.42% and 93.55% accuracy values obtained on UNSW-B15, NSL-KDD and KDDCUP'99 datasets, respectively, and outperforms alternative schemes in the literature.",

It targets full system software stack testing including both the user space and kernel space. Combining these two mainstream techniques enables us to achieve higher coverage and avoid getting stuck both in fuzz testing and symbolic execution. We also proposed two key optimizations to improve the efficiency of full system testing. We evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method on real-world binary software and 844 memory corruption vulnerable programs in the Juliet test suite. The results show that Ffuzz can discover software bugs in the full system software stack effectively and efficiently.",

A comprehensive early warning system is presented in this paper, which combines active measurement and anomaly detection. The key visualization algorithm and technology of the system are mainly discussed. The large-scale network system's plane visualization is realized based on the divide and conquer thought. First, the topology of the large-scale network is divided into some small-scale networks by the MLkP/CR algorithm. Second, the sub graph plane visualization algorithm is applied to each small-scale network. Finally, the small-scale networks' topologies are combined into a topology based on the automatic distribution algorithm of force analysis. As the algorithm transforms the large-scale network topology plane visualization problem into a series of small-scale network topology plane visualization and distribution problems, it has higher parallelism and is able to handle the display of ultra-large-scale network topology.",

    "abstract": "Malware is a common word in modern era. Everyone using computer is aware of it. Some users have to face the problem known as Cyber crimes. Nobody can survive without use of modern technologies based on computer networking. To avoid threat of malware, different companies provide antivirus strategies on a high cost. To prevent the data and keep privacy, companies using computers have to buy these antivirus programs (software). Software varies due to types of malware and is developed on structure of malware with a deep insight on behavior of nodes. We selected a mathematical malware propagation model having variable infection rate. We were interested in examining the impact of memory effects in this dynamical system in the sense of fractal fractional (FF) derivatives. In this paper, theoretical analysis is performed by concepts of fixed point theory. Existence, uniqueness and stability conditions are investigated for FF model. Numerical algorithm based on Lagrange two points interpolation polynomial is formed and simulation is done using Matlab R2016a on the deterministic model. We see the impact of different FF orders using power law kernel. Sensitivity analysis of different parameters such as initial infection rate, variable adjustment to sensitivity of infected nodes, immune rate of antivirus strategies and loss rate of immunity of removed nodes is investigated under FF model and is compared with classical. On investigation, we find that FF model describes the effects of memory on nodes in detail. Antivirus software can be developed considering the effect of FF orders and parameters to reduce persistence and eradication of infection. Small changes cause significant perturbation in infected nodes and malware can be driven into passive mode by understanding its propagation by FF derivatives and may take necessary actions to prevent the disaster caused by cyber crimes.",

Identity-based cryptography, an increasingly popular branch of cryptography, is widely used to protect the information confidentiality in the critical infrastructure sector due to the ability to directly compute the user's public key based on the user's identity. However, computational requirements complicate the practical application of Identity-based cryptography. In order to improve the efficiency of identity-based cryptography, this paper presents an effective method to construct pairing-friendly elliptic curves with low hamming weight 4 under embedding degree 1. Based on the analysis of the Complex Multiplication(CM) method, the soundness of our method to calculate the characteristic of the finite field is proved. And then, three relative algorithms to construct pairing-friendly elliptic curve are put forward. 10 elliptic curves with low hamming weight 4 under 160 bits are presented to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Finally, the evaluation also indicates that it is more efficient to compute Tate pairing with our curves, than that of Bertoni et al.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents TrustSign, a novel, trusted automatic malware signature generation method based on high-level deep features transferred from a VGG-19 neural network model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. While traditional automatic malware signature generation techniques rely on static or dynamic analysis of the malware's executable, our method overcomes the limitations associated with these techniques by producing signatures based on the presence of the malicious process in the volatile memory. By leveraging the cloud's virtualization technology, TrustSign analyzes the malicious process in a trusted manner, since the malware is unaware and cannot interfere with the inspection procedure. Additionally, by removing the dependency on the malware's executable, our method is fully capable of signing fileless malware as well. TrustSign's signature generation process does not require feature engineering or any additional model training, and it is done in a completely unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for a human expert. Because of this, our method has the advantage of dramatically reducing signature generation and distribution time. In fact, in this paper we rethink the typical use of deep convolutional neural networks and use the VGG-19 model as a topological feature extractor for a vastly different task from the one it was trained for. The results of our experimental evaluation demonstrate TrustSign's ability to generate signatures impervious to the process state over time. By using the signatures generated by TrustSign as input for various supervised classifiers, we achieved up to 99.5% classification accuracy.",

However, existing approaches can only qualitatively analyze privacy leak behavior of software applications. No quantitative approach, to the best of our knowledge, has been developed in the open literature. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose for the first time four quantitative metrics, namely, possibility, severity, crypticity, and manipulability, for privacy leak behavior analysis based on Privacy Petri Net (PPN). In order to compare the privacy leak behavior among different software, we further propose a comprehensive metric, namely, overall leak degree, based on these four metrics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world software applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can quantitatively analyze the privacy leak behaviors of various software types and reveal their characteristics from different aspects.",

    "abstract": "Portable devices and sensors-based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) healthcare can remotely detect patients' physiological data and provide first-class healthcare services. However, the high privacy and sensitivity of medical data make IoMT healthcare systems vulnerable to various attacks. While numerous authentication protocols have been introduced in recent years to guarantee authorized access, these schemes continue to face challenges such as privacy disclosure, untraceability of malicious behavior, insufficient cross-hospital access, and concerns related to single points of failure and trust. To address these issues, we propose a Double Anonymity Strategy to hide identities between doctors and the patients while allowing the authorized party to track their malicious behavior, enhance users' privacy and track malicious users. Our approach leverages the advantages of blockchain, such as decentralization, and replaces trusted third parties with smart contracts for efficient and automatic identity authentication. Additionally, we introduce a cross-hospital authentication scheme that incorporates three-factor secrecy, ensuring that even if any two of the three factors (device, biometric information and password) are compromised, the security of the proposed scheme will not be affected. The security of our scheme is formally proven under the random oracle model, which formally measures that the probability of an adversary breaking the scheme is negligible. We also provide informal security analysis showing that our scheme prevents privacy breaches, achieves decentralization, and addresses existing various attacks. Furthermore, through simulation of the proposed scheme and comparison with related works, we demonstrate that our scheme achieves 23% to 87% reduction in computational cost while maintaining higher security properties.",

    "title": "DS-ARP: a new detection scheme for ARP spoofing attacks based on routing trace for ubiquitous environments.",
    "abstract": "Despite the convenience, ubiquitous computing suffers from many threats and security risks. Security considerations in the ubiquitous network are required to create enriched and more secure ubiquitous environments. The address resolution protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to identify the IP address and the physical address of the associated network card. ARP is designed to work without problems in general environments. However, since it does not include security measures against malicious attacks, in its design, an attacker can impersonate another host using ARP spoofing or access important information. In this paper, we propose a new detection scheme for ARP spoofing attacks using a routing trace, which can be used to protect the internal network. Tracing routing can find the change of network movement path. The proposed scheme provides high constancy and compatibility because it does not alter the ARP protocol. In addition, it is simple and stable, as it does not use a complex algorithm or impose extra load on the computer system.",

    "title": "Extending the IEEE 802.15.4 security suite with a compact implementation of the NIST P-192/B-163 elliptic curves.",
    "abstract": "Typically, commercial sensor nodes are equipped with MCUsclocked at a low-frequency (i.e., within the 4-12 MHz range). Consequently, executing cryptographic algorithms in those MCUs generally requires a huge amount of time. In this respect, the required energy consumption can be higher than using a separate accelerator based on a Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that is switched on when needed. In this manuscript, we present the design of a cryptographic accelerator suitable for an FPGA-based sensor node and compliant with the IEEE802.15.4 standard. All the embedded resources of the target platform (Xilinx Artix-7) have been maximized in order to provide a cost-effective solution. Moreover, we have added key negotiation capabilities to the IEEE 802.15.4 security suite based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Our results suggest that tailored accelerators based on FPGA can behave better in terms of energy than contemporary software solutions for motes, such as the TinyECC and NanoECC libraries. In this regard, a point multiplication (PM) can be performed between 8.58- and 15.4-times faster, 3.40- to 23.59-times faster (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, ECDH) and between 5.45- and 34.26-times faster (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme, ECIES). Moreover, the energy consumption was also improved with a factor of 8.96 (PM).",

    "abstract": "The electronic sharing of medical imaging data is an important element of modern healthcare systems, but current infrastructure for cross-site image transfer depends on trust in third-party intermediaries. In this work, we examine the blockchain concept, which enables parties to establish consensus without relying on a central authority. We develop a framework for cross-domain image sharing that uses a blockchain as a distributed data store to establish a ledger of radiological studies and patient-defined access permissions. The blockchain framework is shown to eliminate third-party access to protected health information, satisfy many criteria of an interoperable health system, and readily generalize to domains beyond medical imaging. Relative drawbacks of the framework include the complexity of the privacy and security models and an unclear regulatory environment. Ultimately, the large-scale feasibility of such an approach remains to be demonstrated and will depend on a number of factors which we discuss in detail.",

Nowadays, almost all information is digital in nature and security from hackers and eavesdroppers has become vital in civil (big giant corporations) as well as in defense organizations. One type of information in bit streams is in the form of digital images. In this article, an idea to combine Brownian motion with ternary unique orientation has been implemented which is related to random motion over time and spatial coordinates. Moreover, chaotic dynamical map has been used to add one more security level to the proposed encryption scheme. The proposed scheme is evaluated on different statistical tests and these results are compared with already existing benchmarks.

Memcached vulnerabilities have been targeted by attackers using DDoS amplification attacks.

The bandwidth amplification factor of nearly 50,000 makes Memcached the deadliest DDoS attack vector to date. In recent times, fellow researchers have made specific efforts to analyze and evaluate Memcached vulnerabilities; however, the solutions provided for security are based on best practices by users and service providers. This study is the first attempt at modifying the architecture of Memcached servers in the context of improving security against DDoS attacks. This study discusses the Memcached protocol, the vulnerabilities associated with it, the future challenges for different IoT applications associated with caches, and the solutions for detecting Memcached DDoS attacks. The proposed solution is a novel identification-pattern mechanism using a threshold scheme for detecting volume-based DDoS attacks. In the undertaken study, the solution acts as a pre-emptive measure for detecting DDoS attacks while maintaining low latency and high throughput.",

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified cyber attacks as an emerging concern, and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) have increased security requirements and are enforcing compliance through stiff financial penalties. The purpose of this study is to describe health care breaches of protected information, analyze the hazards and vulnerabilities of reported breach cases, and prescribe best practices of managing risk through security controls and countermeasures. Prescriptive findings were used to construct a checklist tool to assess and monitor common risks. This research uses a case methodology to describe specific examples of the 3 major types of cyber breach hazards: portable device, insider, and physical breaches. We utilize a risk management framework to prescribe preventative actions that organizations can take to assess, analyze, and mitigate these risks. The health care sector has the largest number of reported breaches, with 3 major types: portable device, insider, and physical breaches. Analysis of actual cases indicates security gaps requiring prescriptive fixes based on \"best practices.\" Our research culminates in a 25-item checklist that organizations can use to assess existing practices and identify security gaps requiring improvement.",

With the expansion of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, the need for robust and efficient threat detection methods has become increasingly critical. The rapid expansion of IoMT networks demands solutions that can automatically identify network-based threats with high precision and low computational cost. This paper presents a novel approach using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) that enhances threat detection and develops mitigation strategies for securing IoMT architectures. A custom-designed graphical user interface (GUI) has been created, allowing automated threat detection and the recommendation of mitigation measures. The GUI processes IoMT model images, identifying the components, associated cyber-threats, and propose appropriate mitigation steps. We present results from a real-world case study demonstrating the efficacy of real-time threat detection in reducing the potential impact of cyberattacks on IoMT networks.",

As multiple patients' data is always stored in the cloud server simultaneously, it is a challenge to guarantee the confidentiality of PHR data and allow data users to search encrypted data in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. To this end, we design a secure cryptographic primitive called as attribute-based multi-keyword search over encrypted personal health records in multi-owner setting to support both fine-grained access control and multi-keyword search via Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. Formal security analysis proves our scheme is selectively secure against chosen-keyword attack.

    "abstract": "How can we find patterns and anomalies in a tensor, i.e., multi-dimensional array, in an efficient and directly interpretable way? How can we do this in an online environment, where a new tensor arrives at each time step? Finding patterns and anomalies in multi-dimensional data have many important applications, including building safety monitoring, health monitoring, cyber security, terrorist detection, and fake user detection in social networks. Standard tensor decomposition results are not directly interpretable and few methods that propose to increase interpretability need to be made faster, more memory efficient, and more accurate for large and quickly generated data in the online environment. We propose two versions of a fast, accurate, and directly interpretable tensor decomposition method we call CTD that is based on efficient sampling method. First is the static version of CTD, i.e., CTD-S, that provably guarantees up to 11× higher accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art method. Also, CTD-S is made up to 2.3× faster and up to 24× more memory-efficient than the state-of-the-art method by removing redundancy. Second is the dynamic version of CTD, i.e. CTD-D, which is the first interpretable dynamic tensor decomposition method ever proposed. It is also made up to 82× faster than the already fast CTD-S by exploiting factors at previous time step and by reordering operations. With CTD, we demonstrate how the results can be effectively interpreted in online distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack detection and online troll detection.",

    "title": "Restoring private autism dataset from sanitized database using an optimized key produced from enhanced combined PSO-GWO framework.",
    "abstract": "The timely identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children is imperative to prevent potential challenges as they grow. When sharing data related to autism for an accurate diagnosis, safeguarding its security and privacy is a paramount concern to fend off unauthorized access, modification, or theft during transmission. Researchers have devised diverse security and privacy models or frameworks, most of which often leverage proprietary algorithms or adapt existing ones to address data leakage. However, conventional anonymization methods, although effective in the sanitization process, proved inadequate for the restoration process. Furthermore, despite numerous scholarly contributions aimed at refining the restoration process, the accuracy of restoration remains notably deficient. Based on the problems identified above, this paper presents a novel approach to data restoration for sanitized sensitive autism datasets with improved performance. In the prior study, we constructed an optimal key for the sanitization process utilizing the proposed Enhanced Combined PSO-GWO framework. This key was implemented to conceal sensitive autism data in the database, thus avoiding information leakage. In this research, the same key was employed during the data restoration process to enhance the accuracy of the original data recovery. Therefore, the study enhanced the restoration process for ASD data's security and privacy by utilizing an optimal key produced via the Enhanced Combined PSO-GWO framework. When compared to existing meta-heuristic algorithms, the simulation results from the autism data restoration experiments demonstrated highly competitive accuracies with 99.90%, 99.60%, 99.50%, 99.25%, and 99.70%, respectively. Among the four types of datasets used, this method outperforms other existing methods on the 30-month autism children dataset, mostly.",

    "abstract": "An effectively designed e-healthcare system can significantly enhance the quality of access and experience of healthcare users, including facilitating medical and healthcare providers in ensuring a smooth delivery of services. Ensuring the security of patients' electronic health records (EHRs) in the e-healthcare system is an active research area. EHRs may be outsourced to a third-party, such as a community healthcare cloud service provider for storage due to cost-saving measures. Generally, encrypting the EHRs when they are stored in the system (i.e. data-at-rest) or prior to outsourcing the data is used to ensure data confidentiality. Searchable encryption (SE) scheme is a promising technique that can ensure the protection of private information without compromising on performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for controlling access to EHRs stored in semi-trusted cloud servers (e.g. a private cloud or a community cloud). To achieve fine-grained access control for EHRs, we leverage the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technique to encrypt tables published by hospitals, including patients' EHRs, and the table is stored in the database with the primary key being the patient's unique identity. Our framework can enable different users with different privileges to search on different database fields. Differ from previous attempts to secure outsourcing of data, we emphasize the control of the searches of the fields within the database. We demonstrate the utility of the scheme by evaluating the scheme using datasets from the University of California, Irvine.",

In this paper, we show that their scheme is vulnerable to the reflection attacks. Furthermore, it fails to provide three-factor security and the user anonymity. We propose a new three-factor authentication scheme for the telecare medicine information systems. Detailed analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication, server not knowing password and freedom of password, biometric update and three-factor security. Moreover, the new scheme provides the user anonymity. As compared with the previous three-factor authentication schemes, the proposed scheme is more secure and practical.",

    "abstract": "Graded diagnosis and treatment, referral, and expert consultations between medical institutions all require cross domain access to patient medical information to support doctors' treatment decisions, leading to an increase in cross domain access among various medical institutions within the medical consortium. However, patient medical information is sensitive and private, and it is essential to control doctors' cross domain access to reduce the risk of leakage. Access control is a continuous and long-term process, and it first requires verification of the legitimacy of user identities, while utilizing control policies for selection and management. After verifying user identity and access permissions, it is also necessary to monitor unauthorized operations. Therefore, the content of access control includes authentication, implementation of control policies, and security auditing. Unlike the existing focus on authentication and control strategy implementation in access control, this article focuses on the control based on access log security auditing for doctors who have obtained authorization to access medical resources. This paper designs a blockchain based doctor intelligent cross domain access log recording system, which is used to record, query and analyze the cross domain access behavior of doctors after authorization. Through DBSCAN clustering analysis of doctors' cross domain access logs, we find the abnormal phenomenon of cross domain access, and build a penalty function to dynamically control doctors' cross domain access process, so as to reduce the risk of Data breach. Finally, through comparative analysis and experiments, it is shown that the proposed cross domain access control model for medical consortia based on DBSCAN and penalty function has good control effect on the cross domain access behavior of doctors in various medical institutions of the medical consortia, and has certain feasibility for the cross domain access control of doctors.",

    "abstract": "Historically, the unauthorised access and theft of information was a tactic used between countries as part of espionage campaigns, during times of conflict as well as for personal and criminal purposes. The consumers of the information were relatively isolated and specific. As information became stored and digitised in larger quantities in the 1980s the ability to access mass amounts of records at one time became possible. The expertise needed to remotely access and exfiltrate the data was not readily available and the number of markets to monetise the data was limited. Over the past ten years, shadow networks have been used by criminals to collaborate on hacking techniques, exchange hacking advice anonymously and commercialise data on the black market. The intersection of these networks along with the unintentional losses of information have resulted in 5,810 data breaches made public since 2005 (comprising some 847,807,830 records) and the velocity of these events is increasing. Organisations must be prepared for a potential breach event to maintain cyber resiliency. Proper management of a breach response can reduce response costs and can serve to mitigate potential reputational losses.",

This article develops and tests a revised version of risk homeostasis theory, which suggests that new cybersecurity technologies can sometimes have ill effects on security outcomes in the short run and little-to-no effect over the long run. It tests the preliminary plausibility of four predictions from the revised risk homeostasis theory using new survey data from 1,072 respondents. The estimations suggest the plausible operation of a number of risk homeostasis dynamics: (1) commercial AV users are significantly more likely to self-report a cybersecurity event in the past year than nonusers, even after correcting for potential reverse causality and informational mechanisms; (2) nonusers become somewhat less likely to self-report a cybersecurity event as the perceived riskiness of various e-mail-based behaviors increases, while commercial AV users do not; (3) the negative short-run effect of commercial AV use on cybersecurity outcomes fade over time at a predicted rate of about 7.03 percentage points per year of use; and (4) after five years of use, commercial AV users are statistically indistinguishable from nonusers in terms of their probability of self-reporting a cybersecurity event as perceptions of risky e-mail-based behaviors increase.",

    "title": "An Improved Two-Layer Authentication Scheme for Wireless Body Area Networks.",
    "abstract": "Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprises a number of sensor nodes and the portable mobile device such as smartphone. It is used to monitor the physical condition and provide a reliable healthcare system. Utilizing the wireless communication network, sensor nodes collect the physiological data of one patient to the portable mobile device and the latter analyzes and transmits them to the application providers. Therefore, the personal data confidentiality and user privacy are cores of WBANs. Recently, Shen et al. presented a multi-layer authentication protocol for WBANs, which is lightweight and much easier to implement. However, we observe that their authentication between sensor nodes and the portable mobile device could ensure the forward security property only when the sensor nodes are changed (add or delete). When the sensor nodes are constant, the security property is not satisfied. Meanwhile, the authentication between the portable mobile device and application provider is prone to mutual impersonation attack, so the critical goal of mutual authentication can not be achieved. In this paper, an improved two-layer authentication scheme is proposed to remove the flaws. The analysis shows that our method is more secure and could withstand various attacks.",

    "title": "Novel Threshold Changeable Secret Sharing Schemes Based on Polynomial Interpolation.",
    "abstract": "After any distribution of secret sharing shadows in a threshold changeable secret sharing scheme, the threshold may need to be adjusted to deal with changes in the security policy and adversary structure. For example, when employees leave the organization, it is not realistic to expect departing employees to ensure the security of their secret shadows. Therefore, in 2012, Zhang et al. proposed (t → t', n) and ({t1, t2,⋯, tN}, n) threshold changeable secret sharing schemes. However, their schemes suffer from a number of limitations such as strict limit on the threshold values, large storage space requirement for secret shadows, and significant computation for constructing and recovering polynomials. To address these limitations, we propose two improved dealer-free threshold changeable secret sharing schemes. In our schemes, we construct polynomials to update secret shadows, and use two-variable one-way function to resist collusion attacks and secure the information stored by the combiner. We then demonstrate our schemes can adjust the threshold safely.",

However, this rapid expansion has also introduced critical challenges related to data security, privacy, and system reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval integrity verification and multi-system data interoperability mechanism for a Blockchain Oracle in smart healthcare with IoT Integration (RIVMD-BO). The mechanism uses the cuckoo filter technology to effectively reduce the computational complexity and ensures the authenticity and integrity of data transmission and use through data retrieval integrity verification.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of internet-connected devices, along with the continuous evolution of cyber-attacks, in terms of volume and ingenuity, has led to a widened cyber-threat landscape, rendering infrastructures prone to malicious attacks. Towards addressing systems' vulnerabilities and alleviating the impact of these threats, this paper presents a machine learning based situational awareness framework that detects existing and newly introduced network-enabled entities, utilizing the real-time awareness feature provided by the SDN paradigm, assesses them against known vulnerabilities, and assigns them to a connectivity-appropriate network slice. The assessed entities are continuously monitored by an ML-based IDS, which is trained with an enhanced dataset. Our endeavor aims to demonstrate that a neural network, trained with heterogeneous data stemming from the operational environment (common vulnerability enumeration IDs that correlate attacks with existing vulnerabilities), can achieve more accurate prediction rates than a conventional one, thus addressing some aspects of the situational awareness paradigm. The proposed framework was evaluated within a real-life environment and the results revealed an increase of more than 4% in the overall prediction accuracy.",

The theme of this study is network data security, with the test subject being a classified and sensitive network laboratory that belongs to the academic network. The analysis is based on the deficiencies and potential risks of the network's existing defense technology, characteristics of cyber attacks, and network security technologies. Subsequently, a distributed network security architecture using the technology of an intrusion prevention system is designed and implemented. In this paper, first, the overall design approach is presented. This design is used as the basis to establish a network defense model, an improvement over the traditional single-technology model that addresses the latter's inadequacies. Next, a distributed network security architecture is implemented, comprising a hybrid firewall, intrusion detection, virtual honeynet projects, and connectivity and interactivity between these three components. Finally, the proposed security system is tested. A statistical analysis of the test results verifies the feasibility and reliability of the proposed architecture. The findings of this study will potentially provide new ideas and stimuli for future designs of network security architecture.",

    "abstract": "Two threat-induced emotions and their respective ability to sway cybersecurity preferences were investigated after a cyberattack on financial institutions. Our theoretical aim was to advance the functionalist claim and differentiate between fear and anxiety by their action tendencies. The emotions were expected to have unique motivation power and thus show mutually exclusive ties to the three types of safety behaviors emerged in our study. Avoidance would be uniquely embraced by fearful participants, whereas surveillance and vigilance would uniquely appeal to anxious participants. Study 1 (N = 199) used a cross-sectional design and found full support for the hypothesis regarding anxiety but only partial support for the hypothesis regarding fear. Study 2 (N = 304), an experiment of fearful, anxious, and relaxed groups, did not yield significant results but did offer methodological recommendations. The quasi-experiments in Study 3 (N = 120) and Study 4 (N = 156) supported the hypotheses on fear and anxiety. Our results in the novel domain of cyber threat brought new evidence to bear on the mixed literature on fear and anxiety. A discussion is offered on the methodological challenges of differentiating two closely related emotions as well as implications for the emerging debate of cybersecurity solutions.

The study aims to develop a framework for evaluating and prioritizing integrity schemes in healthcare for IoT-based medical sensor devices, addressing the challenges of selecting the right authentication solution due to its complexity and intricacy. A unified health-hesitant fuzzy expert system for IoMT sensor integrity assessment in Saudi Arabia is described in this paper. Medical sensor integrity literature and professionals are contacted first. Delphi is used to gather attributes of integrity approaches while an Internet of Things medical sensor integrity specialist supervises the operation. After collecting characteristics, good assessment criteria are created and the hesitant fuzzy analytic network procedure is used to assess integrity. Functional integrity and measurement accuracy are the biggest factors in IoMT sensor security and integrity, according to assessment. The framework achieves 93%, 94%, and 95% precision, accuracy, and recall compared to current approaches. The framework helps healthcare integrity security professionals and stakeholders assess and resolve IoT medical sensor authentication issues. This health-hesitant fuzzy expert system will let Saudi Arabian and international healthcare stakeholders safely deploy IoMT sensors in the changing healthcare landscape.",

    "abstract": "Continuous and emerging advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)-to-Cloud applications to be induced by data pipelines and Edge Intelligence-based architectures. Advanced vehicular networks greatly benefit from these architectures due to the implicit functionalities that are focused on realizing the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) vision. However, IoV is susceptible to attacks, where adversaries can easily exploit existing vulnerabilities. Several attacks may succeed due to inadequate or ineffective authentication techniques. Hence, there is a timely need for hardening the authentication process through cutting-edge access control mechanisms. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Multi-Factor authentication model that uses an embedded Digital Signature (MFBC_eDS) for vehicular clouds and Cloud-enabled IoV. Our proposed MFBC_eDS model consists of a scheme that integrates the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) to the Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for a connected edge to cloud ecosystem. MFBC_eDS draws an essential comparison with the baseline authentication scheme suggested by Karla and Sood. Based on the foundations of Karla and Sood's scheme, an embedded Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Algorithm (ePPTA) and an additional Hash function for the Pi generated during Karla and Sood's authentication were proposed and discussed. The preliminary analysis of the proposition shows that the approach is more suitable to counter major adversarial attacks in an IoV-centered environment based on the Dolev-Yao adversarial model while satisfying aspects of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad.",

Most experts expect that this change will put the brakes on the CFAA as a severe punishment policy, and result in a drop in controversial court decisions. In this study, we analyze the definitions and the penalties for hacking for each country and compare them with the national law and then make suggestions through more specific legislation.

The primary reason behind this is the security and privacy of the data and the participating entities. To overcome this, blockchain technology has emerged as a convenient means to improve the security and privacy of the data and its users. With the deluge of medical data generated through electronic medical records and other ICT based mechanisms, blockchain has found innumerable opportunities in the healthcare domain. The traditional healthcare systems are radically adopting modern day technologies for transitioning into the smart healthcare ecosystems. The convenience of the users and ease of use are the primary factors driving this transition. Even with smart healthcare systems (SHS) there exist numerous challenges and issues related to the security, transparency and privacy of the data and users. This paper explores the technological and social barriers in adoption of SHS by analyzing state-of-the-art expert views and user's perception. It further proposes a blockchain based SHS framework to provide intrinsic security and integrity of the system.

On-demand availability of various data as services in a shared and automated environment has become a reality with the advent of cloud computing. The digital fingerprinting technique has been adopted as an effective solution to protect the copyright and privacy of digital properties from illegal distribution and identification of malicious traitors over the cloud. Furthermore, it is used to trace the unauthorized distribution and the user of multimedia content distributed through the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique for the cloud environment to protect numeric attributes in relational databases for digital privacy management. The proposed solution with the novel fingerprinting scheme is robust and efficient. It can address challenges such as embedding secure data over the cloud, essential to secure relational databases. The proposed technique provides a decoding accuracy of 100%, 90%, and 40% for 10% to 30%, 40%, and 50% of deleted records.",

    "abstract": "The persistent evolution of cyber threats has given rise to Gen V Multi-Vector Attacks, complex and sophisticated strategies that challenge traditional security measures. This research provides a complete investigation of recent intrusion detection systems designed to mitigate the consequences of Gen V Multi-Vector Attacks. Using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), we evaluate the efficacy of several different intrusion detection techniques in adjusting to the dynamic nature of sophisticated cyber threats. The study offers an integrated analysis, taking into account criteria such as detection accuracy, adaptability, scalability, resource effect, response time, and automation. Fuzzy AHP is employed to establish priority weights for each factor, reflecting the nuanced nature of security assessments. Subsequently, TOPSIS is employed to rank the intrusion detection methods based on their overall performance. Our findings highlight the importance of behavioral analysis, threat intelligence integration, and dynamic threat modeling in enhancing detection accuracy and adaptability. Furthermore, considerations of resource impact, scalability, and efficient response mechanisms are crucial for sustaining effective defense against Gen V Multi-Vector Attacks. The integrated approach of Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS presents a strong and adaptable strategy for decision-makers to manage the difficulties of evaluating intrusion detection techniques. This study adds to the ongoing discussion about cybersecurity by providing insights on the positive and negative aspects of existing intrusion detection systems in the context of developing cyber threats. The findings help organizations choose and execute intrusion detection technologies that are not only effective against existing attacks, but also adaptive to future concerns provided by Gen V Multi-Vector Attacks.",

    "title": "An Adaptive Protection System for Sensor Networks Based on Analysis of Neighboring Nodes.",
    "abstract": "Creation and operation of sensor systems is a complex challenge not only for industrial and military purposes but also for consumer services (\"smart city\", \"smart home\") and other applications such as agriculture (\"smart farm\", \"smart greenhouse\"). The use of such systems gives a positive economic effect and provides additional benefits from various points of view. At the same time, due to a large number of threats and challenges to cyber security, it is necessary to detect attacks on sensor systems in a timely manner. Here we present an anomaly detection method in which sensor nodes observe their neighbors and detect obvious deviations in their behavior. In this way, the community of neighboring nodes works collectively to protect one another. The nodes record only those parameters and attributes that are inherent in any node. Regardless of the node's functionality, such parameters include the amount of traffic passing through the node, its Central Processing Unit (CPU) load, as well as the presence and number of packets dropped by the node. Our method's main goal is to implement protection against the active influence of an internal attacker on the whole sensor network. We present the anomaly detection method, a dataset collection strategy, and experimental results that show how different types of attacks can be distinguished in the data produced by the nodes.",

    "title": "agroString: Visibility and Provenance through a Private Blockchain Platform for Agricultural Dispense towards Consumers.",
    "abstract": "It is a known fact that large quantities of farm and meat products rot and are wasted if correct actions are not taken, which may lead to serious health issues if consumed. There is no proper system for tracking and communicating the status of the goods to their respective stakeholders in a secure way. Consumers have every right to know the quality of the products they consume. Using monitoring tools, such as the Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAT), and modern data protection techniques for storing and sharing, will help mitigate data integrity issues during the transmission of sensor records, increasing the data quality. The visibility state at the customer end is also improved, and they are aware of the agricultural product's conditions throughout the real-time distribution process. In this paper, we developed and implemented a CorDapp application to manage the data for the supply chain, called \"agroString\". We collected the temperature and humidity data using IoAT-Edge devices and various datasets from multiple sources. We then sent those readings to the CorDapp agroString and successfully shared them among the relevant parties. With the help of a Corda private blockchain, we attempted to increase data integrity, trust, visibility, provenance, and quality at each logistic step, while decreasing blockchain and central system limitations.",

    "abstract": "Wang et al. proposed a method for obtaining elliptic curves with embedding degree 1 for securing critical infrastructures, and presented several elliptic curves generated by their method with torsion points of 160 bits and 189 bits orders. They also presented some experimental results and claimed that their implementation of an elliptic curve generated with their method is faster than an implementation for embedded devices presented by Bertoni et al. In this paper, we point out that the security and efficiency claims given by Wang et al. are flawed. Specifically, we show that it is possible to solve finite field discrete logarithm problems defined over their elliptic curves in practice. On the elliptic curves with torsion points of 160 bits orders generated by Wang et al., their instances of finite field discrete logarithm problems are solved in around 4 hours by using a standard desktop PC. On the torsion points of 189 bits orders, their instances are solved in around 10 days by using two standard desktop PCs. The hardness of the finite field discrete logarithm problems is one of the most important bases of security; therefore, their elliptic curves should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",

    "abstract": "In the era of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), face forgery models pose significant security threats. These models have caused widespread negative impacts through the creation of forged products targeting public figures, national leaders, and other Persons-of-interest (POI). To address this, we propose the Face Omron Ring (FOR) to proactively protect the POI from face forgery. Specifically, by introducing FOR into a target face forgery model, the model will proactively refuse to forge any face image of protected identities without compromising the forgery capability for unprotected ones. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 face forgery models, StarGAN, AGGAN, AttGAN, and HiSD on the widely used large-scale face image datasets CelebA, CelebA-HQ, and PubFig83. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively protect 5000 different identities with a 100% protection success rate, for each of which only about 100 face images are needed. Our method also shows great robustness against multiple image processing attacks, such as JPEG, cropping, noise addition, and blurring. Compared to existing proactive defense methods, our method offers identity-centric protection for any image of the protected identity without requiring any special preprocessing, resulting in improved scalability and security. We hope that this work can provide a solution for responsible AIGC companies in regulating the use of face forgery models.",

    "abstract": "The Internet has brought with it many benefits; key among them has been its ability to allow the expansion of communication and transfer of all kinds of information throughout the U.S. healthcare system. As a consequence, healthcare has become increasingly dependent on the activities carried out in that environment. It is this very dependence that increases the likelihood of individuals or organizations conducting activities through the Internet that will cause physical and/or psychological harm. These activities have become known by the term \"cyberterrorism.\" In the healthcare landscape this can appear in a variety of forms, such as bringing down a hospital computer system or publicly revealing private medical records. Whatever shape it takes, the general effects are the same: patient care is compromised, and trust in the health system is diminished. Fortunately no significant cyber attack has been successfully launched against a U.S. healthcare organization to date. However, there is evidence to suggest that cyber threats are increasing and that much of the U.S. healthcare system is ill equipped to deal with them. Securing cyberspace is not an easy proposition as the threats are constantly changing, and recognizing that cyberterrorism should be part of a broader information technology risk management strategy, there are several\"best practices\" that can be adopted by healthcare organizations to protect themselves against cyber attacks.",

    "title": "Hacking the Human: The Prevalence Paradox in Cybersecurity.",
    "abstract": "This work assesses the efficacy of the \"prevalence effect\" as a form of cyberattack in human-automation teaming, using an email task. Under the prevalence effect, rare signals are more difficult to detect, even when taking into account their proportionally low occurrence. This decline represents diminished human capability to both detect and respond. As signal probability (SP) approaches zero, accuracy exhibits logarithmic decay. Cybersecurity, a context in which the environment is entirely artificial, provides an opportunity to manufacture conditions enhancing or degrading human performance, such as prevalence effects. Email cybersecurity prevalence effects have not previously been demonstrated, nor intentionally manipulated. The Email Testbed (ET) provides a simulation of a clerical email work involving messages containing sensitive personal information. Using the ET, participants were presented with 300 email interactions and received cyberattacks at rates of either 1%, 5%, or 20%. Results demonstrated the existence and power of prevalence effects in email cybersecurity. Attacks delivered at a rate of 1% were significantly more likely to succeed, and the overall pattern of accuracy across declining SP exhibited logarithmic decay. These findings suggest a \"prevalence paradox\" within human-machine teams. As automation reduces attack SP, the human operator becomes increasingly likely to fail in detecting and reporting attacks that remain. In the cyber realm, the potential to artificially inflict this state on adversaries, hacking the human operator rather than algorithmic defense, is considered. Specific and general information security design countermeasures are offered.",

    "title": "Impossible, unknowable, accountable: Dramas and dilemmas of data law.",
    "abstract": "On May 25, 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force. EU citizens are granted more control over personal data while companies and organizations are charged with increased responsibility enshrined in broad principles like transparency and accountability. Given the scope of the regulation, which aims to harmonize data practices across 28 member states with different concerns about data collection, the GDPR has significant consequences for individuals in the EU and globally. While the GDPR is primarily intended to regulate tech companies, it also has important implications for data use in scientific research. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with researchers, lawyers and legal scholars in Sweden, I argue that the GDPR's flexible accountability principle effectively encourages researchers to reflect on their ethical responsibility but can also become a source of anxiety and produce unexpected results. Many researchers I spoke with expressed profound uncertainty about 'impossible' legal requirements for research data use. Despite the availability of legal texts and interpretations, I suggest we should take researchers' concerns about 'unknowable' data law seriously. Many researchers' sense of legal ambiguity led them to rethink their data practices and themselves as ethical subjects through an orientation to what they imagined as the 'real people behind the data', variously formulated as a Swedish population desiring data use for social benefit or a transnational public eager for research results. The intentions attributed to people, populations and publics - whom researchers only encountered in the abstract form of data - lent ethical weight to various and sometimes conflicting decisions about data security and sharing. Ultimately, researchers' anxieties about their inability to discern the desires of the 'real people' lent new appeal to solutions, however flawed, that promised to alleviate the ethical burden of personal data.",

Ransomware, a type of malicious software that results in the encryption of data and systems for financial extortion, often renders computers and networks inaccessible for prolonged periods of time. Clinical workflows, which depend on connected technology such as electronic health records, laboratory systems, and imaging platforms, may be delayed or disrupted in the setting of a ransomware attack. These attacks may adversely affect the care of patients with time-sensitive conditions. The financial impacts to healthcare delivery organizations can be substantial and may be associated with delayed provider payments, regulatory fines, and class action liability.

Using fixed-time stability theory, the paper derives innovative and practical criteria for FXTS. It also introduces a MINNs to counteract CPA by executing uncertain impulses with RD terms. Designing security control laws for MINNS with RD terms poses significant challenges, particularly when these networks are tasked with cooperative functions in the presence of failures or attacks. A distributed control strategy is introduced to attain FXTS for the delayed MINNs incorporating RD terms. To examine the consequences of CPA, we will build a Lyapunov function and combine it with some M-matrix properties. Additionally, a security control law is provided to guarantee the FXTS of the consider NN system. The demonstrated settling time (ST) of the designated MINNs is provided. From an algorithmic perspective, it is notable that the security framework and control algorithm are designed to select parameters for the feedback gain matrix and coupling strength to achieve synchronization. A numerical model is provided to support the obtained theoretical findings. Finally, our proposition of a multi-image encryption algorithm, utilizing MINNs and secured by robust security protocols, serves to uphold the integrity of electronic healthcare systems, ensuring the safeguarding of sensitive medical data.",

    "abstract": "Data security has been a critical topic of research and discussion since the onset of data sharing in e-health systems. Although digitalization of data has increased efficiency and speed, it has also made data vulnerable to cyber attacks. Medical records in particular seem to be the regular victims of hackers. Several data breach incidents throughout history have warranted the invention of security measures against these threats. Although various security procedures like firewalls, virtual private networks, encryption, etc are present, a mix of these approaches are required for maximum security in medical image and data sharing. Relatively new, blockchain has become an effective tool for safeguarding sensitive information. However, to ensure overall protection of medical data (images), security measures have to be taken at each step, from the beginning, during and even after transmission of medical images which is ensured by zero trust security model. In this research, a number of studies that deal with these two concepts were studied and a decentralized and trustless framework was proposed by combining these two concepts for secured medical data and image transfer and storage. Research output suggested blockchain technology ensures data integrity by maintaining an audit trail of every transaction while zero trust principles make sure the medical data is encrypted and only authenticated users and devices interact with the network. Thus the proposed model solves a lot of vulnerabilities related to data security. A system to combat medical/health data vulnerabilities has been proposed. The system makes use of the immutability of blockchain, the additional security of zero trust principles, and the scalability of off chain data storage using Inter Planetary File Systems (IPFS). The adoption of this system suggests to enhance the security of medical or health data transmission.",

They are also remarkably vulnerable to penetration because of the fluid and always-evolving nature of a patient's medical care and because of the number of clinicians, facilities and transactions required to connect patient care across multiple settings. The addition of mobile healthcare devices and connected healthcare delivery systems (e.g., wearables, monitoring devices, cell phone images) makes healthcare data more attractive but also more vulnerable.

    "abstract": "The advent of smart cities has brought about a paradigm shift in urban management and citizen engagement. By leveraging technological advancements, cities are now able to collect and analyze extensive data to optimize service delivery, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance the overall well-being of residents. However, as cities become increasingly interconnected and data-dependent, concerns related to data privacy and security, as well as citizen participation and representation, have surfaced. This article emphasizes the significance of regulating smart cities to foster a culture of citizenship and safeguard civic rights, security, and privacy. Effective regulatory frameworks are crucial in striking a balance between technological innovation and the protection of fundamental rights. The article examines various pivotal policies and regulations concerning data protection, cybersecurity, and citizen involvement in decision-making processes. Data protection regulations play a vital role in safeguarding individuals' personal information and ensuring its collection, processing, and usage comply with legal requirements. Similarly, cybersecurity regulations are indispensable in fortifying smart city systems against cyber threats. Regulations promoting citizen engagement and participation can cultivate a sense of ownership and responsibility among citizens, contributing to the creation of more inclusive and democratic urban environments. This study used an artificial neural network (ANN) to examine the effects of cyber security regulations, citizen participation, information sharing laws, and data protection on smart city development. Implementing these policies led to a 30% increase in citizen participation over 4 years, which continued even when regulations were temporarily suspended. However, unchanged or reduced regulations led to declines in information sharing. The neural network's predictions showed acceptable error compared to experimental results.",

    "title": "GAN-based data reconstruction attacks in split learning.",
    "abstract": "Due to the distinctive distributed privacy-preserving architecture, split learning has found widespread application in scenarios where computational resources on the client side are limited. Unlike clients in federated learning retaining the whole model, split learning partitions the model into two segments situated separately on the server and client ends, thereby preventing direct access to the complete model structure by either party and fortifying its resilience against attacks. However, existing studies have demonstrated that even with access restricted to partial model outputs, split learning remains susceptible to data reconstruction attacks. This vulnerability persists despite prior research predominantly relying on stringent assumptions and the attacker being the server with the ability to access global information. Building upon this understanding, we devise GAN-based data reconstruction attacks within the U-shaped split learning framework, meticulously examining and confirming the feasibility of attacks initiated from both server and client sides, along with the underlying assumptions. Specifically, for attacks originating from the server, we propose the Model Approximation Estimation Reconstruction Attack (MAERA) to mitigate the requisite prior assumptions, and we also introduce the Distillation-based Client-side Reconstruction Attack (DCRA) to execute data reconstructions from the client for the first time. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed frameworks in launching attacks across various datasets. In particular, MAERA necessitates merely 1% of the test set samples and 1% of the private data samples from the CIFAR100 dataset to unleash effective attacks, while DCRA adeptly expropriates models from clients and yields more pronounced reconstruction effects on target class samples during the process of inferring data distribution characteristics, in contrast to conventional Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "With the development of information technology and the Internet, users can conveniently use roaming services without time and space restrictions. This roaming service is initiated by establishing a session key between a home node, which exists in a home network, and a mobile node, which exists in a foreign network. However, in the process of verifying a legitimate user and establishing a session key, various security threats and privacy exposure issues can arise. This study demonstrates that the authentication scheme for the roaming service proposed in the existing Global Mobility Network (GLOMONET) environment has several vulnerabilities and, hence, is impractical. In addition, the scheme does not satisfy the privacy of the session key or user's identity or password. Accordingly, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme to compensate for these vulnerabilities and secure a high level of privacy, such as non-traceability. In addition, formal and informal analyses are conducted to examine the safety of the proposed scheme. Based on the results of our analyses, we prove that the proposed scheme is highly secure and applicable to the actual GLOMONET environment.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has widely expanded due to its advantages in enhancing the business, industrial, and social ecosystems. Nevertheless, IoT infrastructure is susceptible to several cyber-attacks due to the endpoint devices' restrictions in computation, storage, and communication capacity. As such, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the security of the IoT. Attackers can easily utilize IoT devices as part of botnets to launch DDoS attacks by taking advantage of their flaws. This paper proposes an Ethereum blockchain model to detect and prevent DDoS attacks against IoT systems. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to resolve the single points of failure (dependencies on third parties) and privacy and security in IoT systems. First, we propose implementing a decentralized platform in place of current centralized system solutions to prevent DDoS attacks on IoT devices at the application layer by authenticating and verifying these devices. Second, we suggest tracing and recording the IP address of malicious devices inside the blockchain to prevent them from connecting and communicating with the IoT networks. The system performance has been evaluated by performing 100 experiments to evaluate the time taken by the authentication process. The proposed system highlights two messages with a time of 0.012 ms: the first is the request transmitted from the IoT follower device to join the blockchain, and the second is the blockchain response. The experimental evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our system because there are fewer I/O operations in the proposed system than in other related works, and thus it runs substantially faster.",

    "abstract": "How to improve the robustness to resist attacks and how to adaptively match the key parameters of the watermarking algorithm with the performance requirements to achieve the best performance in different applications are two hot issues in the research of audio watermarking algorithms. An adaptive and blind audio watermarking algorithm based on dither modulation and butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) is proposed. Based on the convolution operation, a stable feature is designed to carry the watermark, which will improve the robustness by means of the stability of this feature to prevent the watermark loss. Blind extraction will be achieved only by comparing the feature value and the quantized value without the original audio. The BOA is used to optimize the key parameters of the algorithm which can be matched with the performance requirements by coding the population and constructing the fitness function. Experimental results confirm that this proposed algorithm can adaptively search for the optimal key parameters that match the performance requirements. Compared with other related algorithms in recent years, it exhibits strong robustness against various signal processing attacks and synchronization attacks.",

    "abstract": "Space Information Network (SIN) has significant benefits of providing communication anywhere at any time. This feature offers an innovative way for conventional wireless customers to access enhanced internet services by using SIN. However, SIN's characteristics, such as naked links and maximum signal latency, make it difficult to design efficient security and routing protocols, etc. Similarly, existing SIN authentication techniques can't satisfy all of the essentials for secure communication, such as privacy leaks or rising authentication latency. The article aims to develop a novel blockchain-based access authentication mechanism for SIN. The proposed scheme uses a blockchain application, which has offered anonymity to mobile users while considering the satellites' limited processing capacity. The proposed scheme uses a blockchain application, which offers anonymity to mobile users while considering the satellites' limited processing capacity. The SIN gains the likelihood of far greater computational capacity devices as technology evolves. Since authenticating in SIN, the technique comprises three entities: low Earth orbit, mobile user, and network control centre. The proposed mutual authentication mechanism avoids the requirement of a ground station, resulting in less latency and overhead during mobile user authentication. Finally, the new blockchain-based authentication approach is being evaluated with AVISPA, a formal security tool. The simulation and performance study results illustrate that the proposed technique delivers efficient security characteristics such as low authentication latency, minimal signal overhead and less computational cost with group authentication.",

    "abstract": "Random beacons play a crucial role in blockchains. Most random beacons in a blockchain are performed in a distributed approach to secure the generation of random numbers. However, blockchain nodes are in an open environment and are vulnerable to adversary reboot attacks. After such an attack, the number of members involved in a random number generation decreases. The random numbers generated by the system become insecure. To solve this problem while guaranteeing fast recovery of capabilities, we designed a threshold signature scheme based on share recovery. A bivariate polynomial was generated among the participants in the distributed key generation phase. While preserving the threshold signature key share, it can also help participants who lost their shares to recover. The same threshold setting for signing and recovery guarantees the security of the system. The results of our scheme show that we take an acceptable time overhead in distributed key generation and simultaneously enrich the share recovery functionality for the threshold signature-based random number generation scheme.",

This study presents an innovative hybrid model that combines game theory and advanced machine learning methods for adaptive cyber defense strategies. Specifically, a repetitive game methodology is implemented to analyze cyber-attacks and model behaviors and study how defenders and attackers make decisions in a competing field. Based on Bayesian inference, the proposed method can predict the next steps in the game to produce the appropriate countermeasures and implement the best cyber defense strategies that govern an organization.

    "abstract": "We identify three risk-related behaviors in coping with cyber threats-the exposure to risk a person chooses, use of security features, and responses to security indications. The combinations of behaviors that users choose determine how well they cope with threats and the severity of adverse events they experience. End users' coping with risks is a major factor in cybersecurity. This behavior results from a combination of risk-related behaviors rather than from a single risk-taking tendency. In two experiments, participants played a Tetris-like game, attempting to maximize their gains, while exogenous occasional attacks could diminish earnings. An alerting system provided indications about possible attacks, and participants could take protective actions to limit the losses from attacks. Variables such as the costs of protective actions, reliability of the alerting system, and attack severity affected the three behaviors differently. Also, users dynamically adjusted each of the three risk-related behaviors after gaining experience with the system. The results demonstrate that users' risk taking is the complex combination of three behaviors rather than the expression of a general risk-taking tendency. The use of security features, exposure to risk, and responses to security indications reflect long-term strategy, short-term tactical decisions, and immediate maneuvering in coping with risks in dynamic environments. The results have implications for the analysis of cybersecurity-related decisions and actions as well as for the evaluation and design of systems and targeted interventions in other domains.",

    "abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a network of cyber and physical elements that interact with each other. In recent years, there has been a drastic increase in the utilization of CPSs, which makes their security a challenging problem to address. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been used for the detection of intrusions in networks. Recent advancements in the fields of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have allowed the development of robust IDS models for the CPS environment. On the other hand, metaheuristic algorithms are used as feature selection models to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. In this background, the current study presents a Sine-Cosine-Adopted African Vultures Optimization with Ensemble Autoencoder-based Intrusion Detection (SCAVO-EAEID) technique to provide cybersecurity in CPS environments. The proposed SCAVO-EAEID algorithm focuses mainly on the identification of intrusions in the CPS platform via Feature Selection (FS) and DL modeling. At the primary level, the SCAVO-EAEID technique employs Z-score normalization as a preprocessing step. In addition, the SCAVO-based Feature Selection (SCAVO-FS) method is derived to elect the optimal feature subsets. An ensemble Deep-Learning-based Long Short-Term Memory-Auto Encoder (LSTM-AE) model is employed for the IDS. Finally, the Root Means Square Propagation (RMSProp) optimizer is used for hyperparameter tuning of the LSTM-AE technique. To demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed SCAVO-EAEID technique, the authors used benchmark datasets. The experimental outcomes confirmed the significant performance of the proposed SCAVO-EAEID technique over other approaches with a maximum accuracy of 99.20%.",

Organisations and enterprises have become prime targets for ransomware as they are more likely to succumb to ransom demands as part of operating expenses to counter the cost incurred from downtime. Despite the prevalence of ransomware as a threat towards organisations, there is very little information outlining how ransomware affects Windows Server environments, and particularly its proprietary domain services such as Active Directory. Hence, we aim to increase the cyber situational awareness of organisations and corporations that utilise these environments. Dynamic analysis was performed using three ransomware variants to uncover how crypto-ransomware affects Windows Server-specific services and processes. Our work outlines the practical investigation undertaken as WannaCry, TeslaCrypt, and Jigsaw were acquired and tested against several domain services. The findings showed that none of the three variants stopped the processes and decidedly left all domain services untouched. However, although the services remained operational, they became uniquely dysfunctional as ransomware encrypted the files pertaining to those services.",

    "abstract": "Rapid technological development has changed drastically the automotive industry. Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine- to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study presents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Preprocessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demonstration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security.",

However, they all suffer inherent limitations. In this paper, we review these limitations and propose WHISPER, a safety-aware location privacy-preserving scheme that adjusts the transmission range of vehicles in order to prevent continuous location monitoring. We detail the set of protocols used by WHISPER, then we compare it against other privacy-preserving schemes. The results show that WHISPER outperformed the other schemes by providing better location privacy levels while still fulfilling road-safety requirements.",

As the digital medical images are transferred over the public network, there is a demand to shield an adequate level of protection. One of the prominent techniques is encryption which secures the medical images. This paper recommends a DICOM image encryption based upon chaotic attractors on frequency domain by integer wavelet transform (IWT) and fused with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence on the spatial domain. The proposed algorithm uses a chaotic 3D Lorenz attractor and logistic map to generate pseudo-random keys for encryption. The algorithm involves subsequent stages, i.e. permutation, substitution, encoding, complementary and decoding. To endorse the resistance of the proposed algorithm, various analyses have been examined for 256 × 256 DICOM images by achieving an average entropy of 7.99, larger keyspace of 10 and non-zero correlation. The overall results confirm that the proposed algorithm is robust against the brute force attacks. Graphical abstract.",

To this end, we propose a Federated Learning with Bilateral Defense via Blockchain (FedBASS) scheme that tackles both threats by implementing a dual-server architecture (Analyzer and Verifier), using CKKS encryption to secure client-uploaded gradients, and employing cosine similarity to detect malicious clients. Additionally, we address the problem of non-IID data by proposing a gradient compensation strategy based on dynamic clustering. To further enhance privacy during clustering, we propose a weakened differential privacy scheme augmented with shuffling. Moreover, in FedBASS, the communication process between servers is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the robustness and transparency of FedBASS and to prevent selfish behaviors by clients and servers. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three datasets prove that FedBASS effectively achieves a balance among model fidelity, robustness, efficiency, privacy, and practicality.",

We combine presentation of the development of DataSHIELD with presentation of an ethnographic study of a workshop to test the technology. DataSHIELD produced an application of the norm of privacy that was practical, flexible and operationalizable in researchers' everyday activities, and one which fulfilled the requirements of ethics committees. We demonstrated that an analysis run via DataSHIELD could precisely replicate results produced by a standard analysis where all data are physically pooled and analyzed together. In developing DataSHIELD, the ethical concept of privacy was transformed into an issue of security. Development of DataSHIELD was based on social practices as well as scientific and ethical motivations. Therefore, the 'success' of DataSHIELD would, likewise, be dependent on more than just the mathematics and the security of the technology.",

Recent research has shown how using common tools, a perpetrator can synthesize biological material, which upon DNA-analysis opens a cyber-backdoor for the perpetrator to hijack control of a computational resource from the DNA-sequencing pipeline. As DNA analysis finds its way into practical everyday applications, the threat of bio-hacking increases. Our wetlab experiments establish that malicious DNA can be synthesized and inserted into E. coli, a common contaminant. Based on that, we propose a new attack, where a hacker to reach the target hides the DNA with malicious code on common surfaces (e.g., lab coat, bench, rubber glove). We demonstrated that the threat of bio-hacking can be mitigated using dedicated input control techniques similar to those used to counter conventional injection attacks. This article proposes to use genetic similarity of biological samples to identify material that has been generated for bio-hacking. We considered freely available genetic data from 506 mammary, lymphocyte and erythrocyte samples that have a bio-hacking code inserted. During the evaluation we were able to detect up to 95% of malicious DNAs confirming suitability of our method.",

Although this technology offers extraordinary results, but at the same time, it also offers multifarious security perils that need to be handled effectively to preserve the trust among all engaged stakeholders. For this, the literature proposes several authentications and data preservation schemes, but somehow they fail to tackle this issue with effectual results. Keeping in view, these constraints, in this paper, we proposed a lightweight authentication and data preservation scheme for IoT based-CPS utilizing deep learning (DL) to facilitate decentralized authentication among legal devices. With decentralized authentication, we have depreciated the validation latency among pairing devices followed by improved communication statistics.

In order to optimize network resources, both the system state and input signal are subjected to quantization using dynamic quantizers. Subsequently, a dynamic state control strategy is proposed, taking into account potential DoS attack. The finite-time boundedness of the fuzzy parabolic PDE is analyzed, with respect to the influence of quantization, through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. The article then presents the conditions for finite-time dissipative control design, alongside the adjustment parameters for the dynamic quantizers within the fuzzy closed-loop system. Furthermore, the decoupling of interlinked nonlinear terms in the control design conditions is achieved by using an arbitrary matrix. Finally, an example is provided and the simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the dissipative control method proposed.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) are widely used in recommendation systems, but traditional centralized methods raise privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a federated framework for privacy-preserving GNN-based recommendations. This framework allows distributed training of GNN models using local user data. Each client trains a GNN using its own user-item graph and uploads gradients to a central server for aggregation. To overcome limited data, we propose expanding local graphs using Software Guard Extension (SGX) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). SGX computes node intersections for subgraph exchange and expansion, while local differential privacy ensures privacy. Additionally, we introduce a personalized approach with Prototype Networks (PN) and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to handle data heterogeneity. This enhances the encoding abilities of the federated meta-learner, enabling precise fine-tuning and quick adaptation to diverse client graph data. We leverage SGX and local differential privacy for secure parameter sharing and defense against malicious servers. Comprehensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over centralized GNN-based recommendations, while preserving user privacy.",

    "abstract": "This paper advocates for the integration of threat exposure monitoring (TEM) as a critical tool in cyber security resilience frameworks. As organisations face increasing cyber threats, TEM provides an essential, proactive approach to identifying potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. By monitoring various online environments, including the dark web, hacker forums and misconfigured cloud storage, TEM can uncover compromised credentials, exposed data and other risk factors that could lead to operational disruptions. This proactive monitoring strategy enhances an organisation's preparedness, helping to prevent costly incidents and mitigate risks before they escalate. Using notable case studies, such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident and the Orange Spain outage, the paper illustrates the devastating impact of cyber breaches and underscores how TEM could help avoid similar disruptions. Readers will gain an understanding of how to implement a TEM programme, identify critical digital assets for monitoring and integrate TEM within broader threat intelligence practices. Ultimately, this paper provides resilience professionals with a structured approach to leveraging TEM for robust cyber defence, offering practical insights on reducing exposure risks and strengthening overall business resiliency.

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the context of medical image analysis within medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Meanwhile, this study proposes an explainable framework that integrates machine learning and knowledge reasoning. The explainability of the model is realized when the framework evolution target feature results and reasoning results are the same and are relatively reliable. However, using these technologies also presents new challenges, including the need to ensure the security and privacy of patient data from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Therefore, attack detection is an essential aspect of MCPS security. For the MCPS model with only sensor attacks, the necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting attacks are given based on the definition of sparse observability. The corresponding attack detector and state estimator are designed by assuming that some IoMT sensors are under protection. It is expounded that the IoMT sensors under protection play an important role in improving the efficiency of attack detection and state estimation. The experimental results show that the XAI in the context of medical image analysis within MCPS improves the accuracy of lesion classification, effectively removes low-quality medical images, and realizes the explainability of recognition results. This helps doctors understand the logic of the system's decision-making and can choose whether to trust the results based on the explanation given by the framework.",

    "title": "Quantum attack-resistent certificateless multi-receiver signcryption scheme.",
    "abstract": "The existing certificateless signcryption schemes were designed mainly based on the traditional public key cryptography, in which the security relies on the hard problems, such as factor decomposition and discrete logarithm. However, these problems will be easily solved by the quantum computing. So the existing certificateless signcryption schemes are vulnerable to the quantum attack. Multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC), which can resist the quantum attack, is one of the alternative solutions to guarantee the security of communications in the post-quantum age. Motivated by these concerns, we proposed a new construction of the certificateless multi-receiver signcryption scheme (CLMSC) based on MPKC. The new scheme inherits the security of MPKC, which can withstand the quantum attack. Multivariate quadratic polynomial operations, which have lower computation complexity than bilinear pairing operations, are employed in signcrypting a message for a certain number of receivers in our scheme. Security analysis shows that our scheme is a secure MPKC-based scheme. We proved its security under the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem and its unforgeability under the Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP) assumption in the random oracle model. The analysis results show that our scheme also has the security properties of non-repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, perfect backward secrecy and public verifiability. Compared with the existing schemes in terms of computation complexity and ciphertext length, our scheme is more efficient, which makes it suitable for terminals with low computation capacity like smart cards.",

These interconnected technologies create potential cyber vulnerabilities. A variety of attacks could be carried out on 9-1-1 infrastructure to various ends. Attackers could target individuals, groups, or entire municipalities. These attacks could result in anything from a nuisance to increased loss of life in a physical attack to worse overall outcomes owing to delays in care for time-sensitive conditions. Evolving 9-1-1 systems are increasingly connected and dependent on network technology. As implications of cybersecurity vulnerabilities loom large, future research should examine methods of hardening the 9-1-1 system against attack.",

    "title": "A Machine Vision Anomaly Detection System to Industry 4.0 Based on Variational Fuzzy Autoencoder.",
    "abstract": "From a technological point of view, Industry 4.0 evolves and operates in a smart environment in which the real and virtual worlds come together through smart cyber-physical systems. These devices that control each other autonomously activate innovative functions that enhance the production process. However, the industrial environment in which the most modern digital automation and information technologies are integrated is an ideal target for large-scale targeted cyberattacks. Implementing an integrated and effective security strategy in the Industrial 4.0 ecosystem presupposes a vertical inspection process at regular intervals to address any new threats and vulnerabilities throughout the production line. This view should be accompanied by the deep conviction of all stakeholders that all systems of modern industrial infrastructure are a potential target of cyberattacks and that the slightest rearrangement of mechatronic systems can lead to generalized losses. Accordingly, given that there is no panacea in designing a security strategy that fully ensures the infrastructure in question, advanced high-level solutions should be adopted, effectively implementing security perimeters without direct dependence on human resources. One of the most important methods of active cybersecurity in Industry 4.0 is the detection of anomalies, i.e., the identification of objects, observations, events, or behaviors that do not conform to the expected pattern of a process. The theme of this work is the identification of defects in the production line resulting from cyberattacks with advanced machine vision methods. An original variational fuzzy autoencoder (VFA) methodology is proposed. Using fuzzy entropy and Euclidean fuzzy similarity measurement maximizes the possibility of using nonlinear transformation through deterministic functions, thus creating an entirely realistic vision system. The final finding is that the proposed system can evaluate and categorize anomalies in a highly complex environment with significant accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Information security can be achieved using cryptography, steganography or a combination of them, where data is firstly encrypted using any of the available cryptography techniques and then hid into any hiding medium. Recently, the famous genomic DNA has been introduced as a hiding medium, known as DNA steganography, due to its notable ability to hide huge data sets with a high level of randomness and hence security. Despite the numerous cryptography techniques, to our knowledge only the vigenere cipher and the DNA-based playfair cipher have been combined with the DNA steganography, which keeps space for investigation of other techniques and coming up with new improvements. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis between the DNA-based playfair, vigenere, RSA and the AES ciphers, each combined with a DNA hiding technique. The conducted analysis reports the performance diversity of each combined technique in terms of security, speed, hiding capacity in addition to both key size and data size. Moreover, this paper proposes a modification of the current combined DNA-based playfair cipher technique, which makes it not only simple and fast but also provides a significantly higher hiding capacity and security. The conducted extensive experimental studies confirm such outstanding performance in comparison with all the discussed combined techniques.",

    "title": "Accurate training of the Cox proportional hazards model on vertically-partitioned data while preserving privacy.",
    "abstract": "Analysing distributed medical data is challenging because of data sensitivity and various regulations to access and combine data. Some privacy-preserving methods are known for analyzing horizontally-partitioned data, where different organisations have similar data on disjoint sets of people. Technically more challenging is the case of vertically-partitioned data, dealing with data on overlapping sets of people. We use an emerging technology based on cryptographic techniques called secure multi-party computation (MPC), and apply it to perform privacy-preserving survival analysis on vertically-distributed data by means of the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model. Both MPC and CPH are explained. We use a Newton-Raphson solver to securely train the CPH model with MPC, jointly with all data holders, without revealing any sensitive data. In order to securely compute the log-partial likelihood in each iteration, we run into several technical challenges to preserve the efficiency and security of our solution. To tackle these technical challenges, we generalize a cryptographic protocol for securely computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix and develop a new method for securely computing exponentiations. A theoretical complexity estimate is given to get insight into the computational and communication effort that is needed. Our secure solution is implemented in a setting with three different machines, each presenting a different data holder, which can communicate through the internet. The MPyC platform is used for implementing this privacy-preserving solution to obtain the CPH model. We test the accuracy and computation time of our methods on three standard benchmark survival datasets. We identify future work to make our solution more efficient. Our secure solution is comparable with the standard, non-secure solver in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. The computation time is considerably larger, although the theoretical complexity is still cubic in the number of covariates and quadratic in the number of subjects. We conclude that this is a promising way of performing parametric survival analysis on vertically-distributed medical data, while realising high level of security and privacy.",

We propose a network access and encryption system that is both economical and easily implemented for integration in developing or existing applications, using well-known and thoroughly tested encryption algorithms.

This paper reports a novel active multifunctional electronic skin capable of independently detecting contact trajectory, acceleration, velocity, and pressure based on the synchronized triboelectrification and piezoelectric effect. Motion trajectories in the full plane can be identified by using a net-cross electrodes configuration design. Under this electrode special structure design, the motion information such as velocity and acceleration can be accurately obtained by the time difference between the peak values of the triboelectric signal. Real-time detection of dynamic pressure with only two electrodes is achieved by a spacer-grid design and a high quality piezoelectric nanofiber film. By virtue of its high sensitivity and precision, a smart anti-counterfeiting signature system (SASS) can be achieved by this self-powered multifunctional electronic skin with the capability of recognizing the writing habits of people within a 100 ms error for security.

    "abstract": "Wireless medical sensor networks (WMSN) comprise of distributed sensors, which can sense human physiological signs and monitor the health condition of the patient. It is observed that providing privacy to the patient's data is an important issue and can be challenging. The information passing is done via the public channel in WMSN. Thus, the patient, sensitive information can be obtained by eavesdropping or by unauthorized use of handheld devices which the health professionals use in monitoring the patient. Therefore, there is an essential need of restricting the unauthorized access to the patient's medical information. Hence, the efficient authentication scheme for the healthcare applications is needed to preserve the privacy of the patients' vital signs. To ensure secure and authorized communication in WMSN, we design a symmetric key based authentication protocol for WMSN environment. The proposed protocol uses only computationally efficient operations to achieve lightweight attribute. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol. We use a formal security proof algorithm to show the scheme security against known attacks. We also use the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulator to show protocol secure against man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. Additionally, we adopt an informal analysis to discuss the key attributes of the proposed scheme. From the formal proof of security, we can see that an attacker has a negligible probability of breaking the protocol security. AVISPA simulator also demonstrates the proposed scheme security against active attacks, namely, man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. Additionally, through the comparison of computational efficiency and security attributes with several recent results, proposed scheme seems to be battered.",

    "abstract": "Although the application of a wide range of sensors has been generalized through the development of technology, the processing of massive alerts generated through data analysis and monitoring remains a challenge. This problem is also found in cyber security because the intrusion detection system (IDS) produces a tremendous number of alerts. Massive alerts not only significantly increase resources for analysis, but also make it difficult to analyze the overall situation of the system. In order to handle massive alerts, we propose using an indicator as a frequency-based representation. The proposed indicator is generated from categorical parameters of alerts that occur within a unit time utilizing frequency and is used for situational awareness with machine learning to detect whether there is a threat or not. The advantage of using indicators is that they can determine the situation for a period without analyzing individual alerts, which helps security experts to recognize the situation in the system and focus on targets that require in-depth analysis. In addition, the conversion from the categorical parameters which is highly related to analysis to numeric parameter allows for applying machine learning. For performance evaluation, we collect data from an HAI testbed similar to real critical infrastructure and conduct experiments using indicators and XGBoost, a classification machine learning algorithm against five famous vulnerability attacks. Consequently, we show that the proposed method can detect attacks with more than 90 percent accuracy, and the performance is enhanced using heterogeneous intrusion detection systems.",

It introduces a tailored audit and validation methodology particularly designed for e-Health applications. Additionally, it presents a comprehensive security catalog derived from primary sources such as law, guides, standards, best practices, and a systematic literature review. This catalog is characterized by its continuous improvement, clarity, completeness, consistency, verifiability, modifiability, and traceability. The authors reviewed electronic health security literature and gathered primary sources of law, guides, standards, and best practices. They organized the catalog according to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 standard and proposed a methodology to ensure its reusability. Moreover, the authors proposed SEC-AM as an audit method. The applicability of the catalog was validated through the audit method, which was conducted on a prominent medical application, OpenEMR. The proposed method and validation for auditing e-Health Applications through the catalog provided a comprehensive framework for developing or evaluating new applications. Through the audit of OpenEMR, several security vulnerabilities were identified, such as DDOs, XSS, JSONi, and CMDi, resulting in a \"Secure\" classification of OpenEMR with a compliance rate of 66.97%. The study demonstrates the proposed catalog's feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing health software security. The authors suggest continuous improvement by incorporating new regulations, knowledge from additional sources, and addressing emerging zero-day vulnerabilities. This approach is crucial for providing practical, safe, and quality medical care amidst increasing cyber threats in the healthcare industry.",

    "abstract": "Advanced lung cancer diagnoses from radiographic images include automated detection of lung cancer from CT-Scan images of the lungs. Deep learning is a popular method for decision making which can be used to classify cancerous and non-cancerous lungs from CT-Scan images. There are many experiments which show the uses of deep learning for performing such classifications but very few of them have preserved the privacy of users. Among existing methods, federated learning limits data sharing to a central server and differential privacy although increases anonymity the original data is still shared. Homomorphic encryption can resolve the limitations of both of these. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data. In our experiment, we have proposed a series of textural information extraction with the implementation of homomorphic encryption of the CT-Scan images of normal, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We have further processed the encrypted data to make it classifiable and later we have classified it with deep learning. The results from the experiments have obtained a classification accuracy of 0.9347.",

    "title": "Development of an IoT Architecture Based on a Deep Neural Network against Cyber Attacks for Automated Guided Vehicles.",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces an integrated IoT architecture to handle the problem of cyber attacks based on a developed deep neural network (DNN) with a rectified linear unit in order to provide reliable and secure online monitoring for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN. The results approve the usefulness of the proposed IoT to provide effective cybersecurity for data visualization and tracking of the AGV status that enhances decision-making and improves industrial productivity.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is the fastest growing technology that has applications in various domains such as healthcare, transportation. It interconnects trillions of smart devices through the Internet. A secure network is the basic necessity of the Internet of Things. Due to the increasing rate of interconnected and remotely accessible smart devices, more and more cybersecurity issues are being witnessed among cyber-physical systems. A perfect intrusion detection system (IDS) can probably identify various cybersecurity issues and their sources. In this article, using various telemetry datasets of different Internet of Things scenarios, we exhibit that external users can access the IoT devices and infer the victim user's activity by sniffing the network traffic. Further, the article presents the performance of various bagging and boosting ensemble decision tree techniques of machine learning in the design of an efficient IDS. Most of the previous IDSs just focused on good accuracy and ignored the execution speed that must be improved to optimize the performance of an ID model. Most of the earlier pieces of research focused on binary classification. This study attempts to evaluate the performance of various ensemble machine learning multiclass classification algorithms by deploying on openly available \"TON-IoT\" datasets of IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) sensors.",

    "title": "An empirical study for mitigating sustainable cloud computing challenges using ISM-ANN.",
    "abstract": "The significance of cloud computing methods in everyday life is growing as a result of the exponential advancement and refinement of artificial technology. As cloud computing makes more progress, it will bring with it new opportunities and threats that affect the long-term health of society and the environment. Many questions remain unanswered regarding sustainability, such as, \"How will widely available computing systems affect environmental equilibrium\"? When hundreds of millions of microcomputers are invisible to each other, what will society look like? What does this mean for social sustainability? This paper empirically investigates the ethical challenges and practices of cloud computing about sustainable development. We conducted a systematic literature review followed by a questionnaire survey and identified 11 sustainable cloud computing challenges (SCCCs) and 66 practices for addressing the identified challenges. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were then used to identify and analyze the interrelationship between the SCCCs. Then, based on the results of the ISM, 11 process areas were determined to develop the proposed sustainable cloud computing challenges mitigation model (SCCCMM). The SCCCMM includes four main categories: Requirements specification, Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Legal Agreement (SLA), Complexity and Cyber security, and Trust. The model was subsequently tested with a real-world case study that was connected to the environment. In a sustainable cloud computing organization, the results demonstrate that the proposed SCCCMM aids in estimating the level of mitigation. The participants in the case study also appreciated the suggested SCCCMM for its practicality, user-friendliness, and overall usefulness. When it comes to the sustainability of their software products, we believe that organizations involved in cloud computing can benefit from the suggested SCCCMM. Additionally, researchers and industry practitioners can expect the proposed model to provide a strong foundation for developing new sustainable methods and tools for cloud computing.",

    "title": "Feature Extraction Approach for Speaker Verification to Support Healthcare System Using Blockchain Security for Data Privacy.",
    "abstract": "Speech is one form of biometric that combines both physiological and behavioral features. It is beneficial for remote-access transactions over telecommunication networks. Presently, this task is the most challenging one for researchers. People's mental status in the form of emotions is quite complex, and its complexity depends upon internal behavior. Emotion and facial behavior are essential characteristics through which human internal thought can be predicted. Speech is one of the mechanisms through which human's various internal reflections can be expected and extracted by focusing on the vocal track, the flow of voice, voice frequency, etc. Human voice specimens of different ages can be emotions that can be predicted through a deep learning approach using feature removal behavior prediction that will help build a step intelligent healthcare system strong and provide data to various doctors of medical institutes and hospitals to understand the physiological behavior of humans. Healthcare is a clinical area with data concentrated where many details are accessed, generated, and circulated periodically. Healthcare systems with many existing approaches like tracing and tracking continuously disclose the system's constraints in controlling patient data privacy and security. In the healthcare system, majority of the work involves swapping or using decisively confidential and personal data. A key issue is the modeling of approaches that guarantee the value of health-related data while protecting privacy and observing high behavioral standards. This will encourage large-scale perception, especially as healthcare information collection is expected to continue far off this current ongoing pandemic. So, the research section is looking for a privacy-preserving, secure, and sustainable system by using a technology called Blockchain. Data related to healthcare and distribution among institutions is a very challenging task. Storage of facts in the centralized form is a targeted choice for cyber hackers and initiates an accordant sight of patients' facts which will cause a problem in sharing information over a network. So, this research paper's approach based on Blockchain for sharing sufferer data in a secured manner is presented. Finally, the proposed model for extracting optimum value in error rate and accuracy was analyzed using different feature removal approaches to determine which feature removal performs better with different voice specimen variations. The proposed method increases the rate of correct evidence collection and minimizes the loss and authentication issues and using feature extraction based on text validation increases the sustainability of the healthcare system.",

    "title": "Business continuity strategies for cyber defence: battling time and information overload.",
    "abstract": "Can the same numbers and letters which are the life blood of modern business and government computer systems be harnessed to protect computers from attack against known information security risks? For the past seven years, Foreign Service officers and technicians of the US Government have sought to maintain diplomatic operations in the face of rising cyber attacks and test the hypothesis that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As eight out of ten attacks leverage known computer security vulnerabilities or configuration setting weaknesses, a pound of cure would seem to be easy to come by. Yet modern security tools present an unusually consequential threat to business continuity - too much rather than too little information on cyber problems is presented, harking back to a phenomenon cited by social scientists in the 1960s called 'information overload'. Experience indicates that the longer the most serious cyber problems go untreated, the wider the attack surface adversaries can find. One technique used at the Department of State, called 'risk scoring', resulted in an 89 per cent overall reduction in measured risk over 12 months for the Department of State's servers and personal computers. Later refinements of risk scoring enabled technicians to correct unique security threats with unprecedented speed. This paper explores how the use of metrics, special care in presenting information to technicians and executives alike, as well as tactical use of organisational incentives can result in stronger cyber defences protecting modern organisations.",

The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) it presents the results of a systematic review of industry 4.0 regarding attacks, vulnerabilities and defense strategies, (2) it details and classifies the attacks, vulnerabilities and defenses mechanisms, and (3) it presents a discussion of recent challenges and trends regarding cybersecurity-related areas for Industry 4.0. From the systematic review, regarding the attacks, the results show that most attacks are carried out on the network layer, where dos-related and mitm attacks are the most prevalent ones. Regarding vulnerabilities, security flaws in services and source code, and incorrect validations in authentication procedures are highlighted. These are vulnerabilities that can be exploited by dos attacks and buffer overflows in industrial devices and networks. Regarding defense strategies, Blockchain is presented as one of the most relevant technologies under study in terms of defense mechanisms, thanks to its ability to be used in a variety of solutions, from Intrusion Detection Systems to the prevention of Distributed dos attacks, and most defense strategies are presented as an after-attack solution or prevention, in the sense that the defense mechanisms are only placed or thought, only after the harm has been done, and not as a mitigation strategy to prevent the cyberattack. Concerning challenges and trends, the review shows that digital sovereignty, cyber sovereignty, and data sovereignty are recent topics being explored by researchers within the Industry 4.0 scope, and GAIA-X and International Data Spaces are recent initiatives regarding data sovereignty. A discussion of trends is provided, and future challenges are pointed out.",

    "title": "Challenges of Global Public Health Emergencies: Development of a Health-Crisis Management Framework.",
    "abstract": "Modern day health care providers have traditionally only focused on meeting the response phase requirements of disasters. The emergence of complex global public health crises such as climate change and extremes, biodiversity loss, emergencies of scarcity, rapid unsustainable urbanization, migrant and refugee surges, domestic and international terrorism, cyber-security, the civilianization of war and conflict, and the global rise of resistant antibiotics has resulted in an unprecedented rise in direct and indirect mortality and morbidity. These crises are beyond the current decision-making and operational capabilities of traditional disaster management and its providers most of who are community level practitioners representing every discipline. The 1930s \"disaster cycle\" concept describes a phase-related approach to meeting the strategic, operational, research, educational, and training components required of disasters; and, presents an opportunity for the structured development of a Health Crisis Management Framework to oversee the phase-related strategic and operational requirements for prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and rehabilitation challenges of major global public health crises. Whereas this approach mimics the manner in which practitioners at every level of society identify with in their daily practices, this approach deserves the support of every clinician, researcher, academic, and ancillary health care provider. Interestingly, this was also the intent of the original 1930 disaster cycle concept.",

    "abstract": "Health 4.0 is an extension of the Industry standard 4.0 which is aimed at the virtualization of health-care services. It employs core technologies and services for integrated management of electronic health records (EHRs), captured through various sensors. The EHR is processed and transmitted to distant experts for better diagnosis and improved healthcare delivery. However, for the successful implementation of Heath 4.0 many challenges do exist. One of the critical issues that needs attention is the security of EHRs in smart health systems. In this work, we have developed a new interpolation scheme capable of providing better quality cover media and supporting reversible EHR embedding. The scheme provides a double layer of security to the EHR by firstly using hyperchaos to encrypt the EHR. The encrypted EHR is reversibly embedded in the cover images produced by the proposed interpolation scheme. The proposed interpolation module has been found to provide better quality interpolated images. The proposed system provides an average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 52.38 dB for a high payload of 0.75 bits per pixel. In addition to embedding EHR, a fragile watermark (WM) is also encrypted using the hyperchaos embedded into the cover image for tamper detection and authentication of the received EHR. Experimental investigations reveal that our scheme provides improved performance for high contrast medical images (MI) when compared to various techniques for evaluation parameters like imperceptibility, reversibility, payload, and computational complexity. Given the attributes of the scheme, it can be used for enhancing the security of EHR in health 4.0.",

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual's social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Finally, governments recruit anti-social criminal networks to launch attacks on third-party infrastructures using botnets.

In terms of website interface and uniform resource locator (URL), most phishing webpages look identical to the actual webpages. Various strategies for detecting phishing websites, such as blacklist, heuristic, Etc., have been suggested. However, due to inefficient security technologies, there is an exponential increase in the number of victims. The anonymous and uncontrollable framework of the Internet is more vulnerable to phishing attacks. Existing research works show that the performance of the phishing detection system is limited. There is a demand for an intelligent technique to protect users from the cyber-attacks. In this study, the author proposed a URL detection technique based on machine learning approaches. A recurrent neural network method is employed to detect phishing URL. Researcher evaluated the proposed method with 7900 malicious and 5800 legitimate sites, respectively. The experiments' outcome shows that the proposed method's performance is better than the recent approaches in malicious URL detection.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet, the continuous increase of malware and its variants have brought greatly challenges for cyber security. Due to the imbalance of the data distribution, the research on malware detection focuses on the accuracy of the whole data sample, while ignoring the detection rate of the minority categories' malware. In the dataset sample, the normal data samples account for the majority, while the attacks' malware accounts for the minority. However, the minority categories' attacks will bring great losses to countries, enterprises, or individuals. For solving the problem, this study proposed the GNGS algorithm to construct a new balance dataset for the model algorithm to pay more attention to the feature learning of the minority attacks' malware to improve the detection rate of attacks' malware. The traditional malware detection method is highly dependent on professional knowledge and static analysis, so we used the Self-Attention with Gate mechanism (SAG) based on the Transformer to carry out feature extraction between the local and global features and filter irrelevant noise information, then extracted the long-distance dependency temporal sequence features by the BiGRU network, and obtained the classification results through the SoftMax classifier. In the study, we used the Alibaba Cloud dataset for malware multi-classification. Compared the GSB deep learning network model with other current studies, the experimental results showed that the Gaussian noise generation strategy (GNGS) could solve the unbalanced distribution of minority categories' malware and the SAG-BiGRU algorithm obtained the accuracy rate of 88.7% on the eight-classification, which has better performance than other existing algorithms, and the GSB model also has a good effect on the NSL-KDD dataset, which showed the GSB model is effective for other network intrusion detection.",

    "abstract": "In response to the rapidly evolving threat landscape in network security, this paper proposes an Evolutionary Machine Learning Algorithm designed for robust intrusion detection. We specifically address challenges such as adaptability to new threats and scalability across diverse network environments. Our approach is validated using two distinct datasets: BoT-IoT, reflecting a range of IoT-specific attacks, and UNSW-NB15, offering a broader context of network intrusion scenarios using GA based hybrid DT-SVM. This selection facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's effectiveness across varying attack vectors. Performance metrics including accuracy, recall, and false positive rates are meticulously chosen to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to accurately identify and adapt to both known and novel threats, thereby substantiating the algorithm's potential as a scalable and adaptable security solution. This study aims to advance the development of intrusion detection systems that are not only reactive but also preemptively adaptive to emerging cyber threats.\" During the feature selection step, a GA is used to discover and preserve the most relevant characteristics from the dataset by using evolutionary principles. Through the use of this technology based on genetic algorithms, the subset of features is optimised, enabling the subsequent classification model to focus on the most relevant components of network data. In order to accomplish this, DT-SVM classification and GA-driven feature selection are integrated in an effort to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. The system has been purposefully designed to efficiently handle data streams in real-time, ensuring that intrusions are promptly and precisely detected. The empirical results corroborate the study's assertion that the IDS outperforms traditional methodologies.",

    "title": "Ecological Interface Design for Computer Network Defense.",
    "abstract": "A prototype ecological interface for computer network defense (CND) was developed. Concerns about CND run high. Although there is a vast literature on CND, there is some indication that this research is not being translated into operational contexts. Part of the reason may be that CND has historically been treated as a strictly technical problem, rather than as a socio-technical problem. The cognitive systems engineering (CSE)/ecological interface design (EID) framework was used in the analysis and design of the prototype interface. A brief overview of CSE/EID is provided. EID principles of design (i.e., direct perception, direct manipulation and visual momentum) are described and illustrated through concrete examples from the ecological interface. Key features of the ecological interface include (a) a wide variety of alternative visual displays, (b) controls that allow easy, dynamic reconfiguration of these displays, (c) visual highlighting of functionally related information across displays, (d) control mechanisms to selectively filter massive data sets, and (e) the capability for easy expansion. Cyber attacks from a well-known data set are illustrated through screen shots. CND support needs to be developed with a triadic focus (i.e., humans interacting with technology to accomplish work) if it is to be effective. Iterative design and formal evaluation is also required. The discipline of human factors has a long tradition of success on both counts; it is time that HF became fully involved in CND. Direct application in supporting cyber analysts.",

Each domain has seen increasing utilization of unique applications of RFID technology. Given the importance of protecting patient and data privacy, potential privacy and security concerns in each domain are discussed. Such concerns, some of which are inherent to existing RFID hardware and software technology, may limit ubiquitous adoption. In addition, an apparent lack of security standards within the RFID domain and specifically health care may also hinder the growth and utility of RFID within health care for the foreseeable future.

The texture patterns from finger knuckle are extracted using Gabor with Exception-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the feature vectors from these texture patterns are acquired using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the false rejection rate without increasing the false acceptance rate and to improve the performance over the conventional hand based modalities. The performance is compared with Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). One of the advantages of FKP authentication is its user friendliness in data collection.",

    "abstract": "Software products from all vendors have vulnerabilities that can cause a security concern. Malware is used as a prime exploitation tool to exploit these vulnerabilities. Machine learning (ML) methods are efficient in detecting malware and are state-of-art. The effectiveness of ML models can be augmented by reducing false negatives and false positives. In this paper, the performance of bagging and boosting machine learning models is enhanced by reducing misclassification. Shapley values of features are a true representation of the amount of contribution of features and help detect top features for any prediction by the ML model. Shapley values are transformed to probability scale to correlate with a prediction value of ML model and to detect top features for any prediction by a trained ML model. The trend of top features derived from false negative and false positive predictions by a trained ML model can be used for making inductive rules. In this work, the best performing ML model in bagging and boosting is determined by the accuracy and confusion matrix on three malware datasets from three different periods. The best performing ML model is used to make effective inductive rules using waterfall plots based on the probability scale of features. This work helps improve cyber security scenarios by effective detection of false-negative zero-day malware.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized healthcare by bringing real-time monitoring and data-driven treatments. Nevertheless, the security of communication between IoMT devices and servers remains a huge problem because of the inherent sensitivity of the health data and susceptibility to cyber threats. Current security solutions, including simple password-based authentication and standard Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) approaches, typically do not achieve an appropriate balance between security and low computational overhead, resulting in the possibility of performance bottlenecks and increased vulnerability to attacks. To overcome these limitations, we present an intelligent two-phase dual authentication framework that improves the security of sensor-to-server communication in IoMT environments. During the registration phase, our framework is based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for rapid key exchange, and during real-time communication, our framework uses the Advanced Encryption Standard Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) to encrypt data securely. The efficiency of the proposed framework was rigorously tested through simulations that evaluated encryption-decryption time, computational cost, latency, and packet delivery ratio. The security resilience was also evaluated against man-in-the-middle, replay, and brute force attacks. The results show that encryption/decryption time is reduced by over 45%, overall computational cost by 45.38%, and latency by 28.42% over existing approaches. Furthermore, the framework achieved a high packet delivery ratio and strong defense against cyber threats for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the medical data across IoMT networks. However, the dual authentication approach doesn't affect the functionality of medical IoT devices while enhancing IoMT security, which makes it an ideal integration option for existing healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the progression of healthcare cybersecurity over 2014-2019 as measured by external risk ratings. We further examined the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings. Using Fortune 1000 firms as a benchmark, time trends in hospital cybersecurity ratings were compared using linear regression. Further, the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings was modeled using logistic regression. Hospital breach data were collected from US HHS, and cybersecurity ratings were provided by BitSight. The resulting study sample yielded 3528 hospital-year observations. In aggregate, we found that hospitals had significantly lower cybersecurity ratings than Fortune 1000 firms, however, hospitals have closed the gap in recent years. We also found that hospitals with the low security ratings were associated with significant risk of a data breach, with the probability of a breach in a given year ranging from 14% to 33%. Recent cyber-attacks in healthcare continue to illustrate the need to better secure information systems. While hospitals have reduced cyber risk over the past decade, they remain statistically more vulnerable than the Fortune 1000 firms against botnets, spam, and malware. Policy makers should continue encouraging acute-care hospitals to proactively invest in security controls that reduce cyber risk. Best practices from other sectors like the financial services sector could provide useful guides and benchmarks for improvement.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity in Hospitals: A Systematic, Organizational Perspective.",
    "abstract": "Cybersecurity incidents are a growing threat to the health care industry in general and hospitals in particular. The health care industry has lagged behind other industries in protecting its main stakeholder (ie, patients), and now hospitals must invest considerable capital and effort in protecting their systems. However, this is easier said than done because hospitals are extraordinarily technology-saturated, complex organizations with high end point complexity, internal politics, and regulatory pressures. The purpose of this study was to develop a systematic and organizational perspective for studying (1) the dynamics of cybersecurity capability development at hospitals and (2) how these internal organizational dynamics interact to form a system of hospital cybersecurity in the United States. We conducted interviews with hospital chief information officers, chief information security officers, and health care cybersecurity experts; analyzed the interview data; and developed a system dynamics model that unravels the mechanisms by which hospitals build cybersecurity capabilities. We then use simulation analysis to examine how changes to variables within the model affect the likelihood of cyberattacks across both individual hospitals and a system of hospitals. We discuss several key mechanisms that hospitals use to reduce the likelihood of cybercriminal activity. The variable that most influences the risk of cyberattack in a hospital is end point complexity, followed by internal stakeholder alignment. Although resource availability is important in fueling efforts to close cybersecurity capability gaps, low levels of resources could be compensated for by setting a high target level of cybersecurity. To enhance cybersecurity capabilities at hospitals, the main focus of chief information officers and chief information security officers should be on reducing end point complexity and improving internal stakeholder alignment. These strategies can solve cybersecurity problems more effectively than blindly pursuing more resources. On a macro level, the cyber vulnerability of a country's hospital infrastructure is affected by the vulnerabilities of all individual hospitals. In this large system, reducing variation in resource availability makes the whole system less vulnerable-a few hospitals with low resources for cybersecurity threaten the entire infrastructure of health care. In other words, hospitals need to move forward together to make the industry less attractive to cybercriminals. Moreover, although compliance is essential, it does not equal security. Hospitals should set their target level of cybersecurity beyond the requirements of current regulations and policies. As of today, policies mostly address data privacy, not data security. Thus, policy makers need to introduce policies that not only raise the target level of cybersecurity capabilities but also reduce the variability in resource availability across the entire health care system.",

This is certainly the case with regard to ensuring the cyber security of the IoT, and there are various examples of devices being hacked. Despite this evidence, little is known about the public perceptions of the opportunities and challenges presented by the IoT. To advance research in this direction, we mined the social media platform Twitter to learn about public opinion about the IoT. Analysing a longitudinal dataset of more than 6.7 million tweets, we reveal insights into public perceptions of the IoT, identifying big data analytics as the most positive aspect, whereas security issues are the main public concern on the negative side.

In order to address the effects caused by unknown disturbances, a switched nonlinear disturbance observer is used, and the error between the estimated signals and actual disturbances is small. Meanwhile, a prescribed performance function is introduced, which aims to ensure system output reaches the performance bounds within a predefined finite time. In addition, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce the communication load. Based on the theoretical analysis, all signals within the closed-loop system are bounded, while simultaneously ensuring the complete elimination of Zeno behavior.

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has raised critical security challenges, necessitating robust encryption techniques to safeguard sensitive healthcare data. However, existing security models often suffer from high computational overhead, inefficiency in handling large-scale IoMT data and vulnerability to cyber threats. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel ESHA-256_GBGO security framework, integrating Enhanced Secure Hash Algorithm-256 (ESHA-256) with the Golden Butterfly Optimization (GBGO) algorithm for improved encryption and performance optimization. The proposed approach enhances data integrity, encryption efficiency and computational speed while ensuring minimal processing overhead. The framework is implemented and evaluated on a real-world IoMT dataset measuring key performance indicators such as encryption efficiency, processing time, throughput and computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ESHA-256_GBGO model achieves 98.76% encryption efficiency, reduces computational overhead by 27.4% and enhances security robustness compared to conventional methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of ESHA-256_GBGO in securing IoMT networks making it a scalable and efficient solution for real-time healthcare applications.",

    "title": "Health IT for Patient Safety and Improving the Safety of Health IT.",
    "abstract": "Alongside their benefits health IT applications can pose new risks to patient safety. Problems with IT have been linked to many different types of clinical errors including prescribing and administration of medications; as well as wrong-patient, wrong-site errors, and delays in procedures. There is also growing concern about the risks of data breach and cyber-security. IT-related clinical errors have their origins in processes undertaken to design, build, implement and use software systems in a broader sociotechnical context. Safety can be improved with greater standardization of clinical software and by improving the quality of processes at different points in the technology life cycle, spanning design, build, implementation and use in clinical settings. Oversight processes can be set up at a regional or national level to ensure that clinical software systems meet specific standards. Certification and regulation are two mechanisms to improve oversight. In the absence of clear standards, guidelines are useful to promote safe design and implementation practices. Processes to identify and mitigate hazards can be formalised via a safety management system. Minimizing new patient safety risks is critical to realizing the benefits of IT.",

    "title": "Vigenere and genetic cross-over acting at the restricted ASCII code level for color image encryption.",
    "abstract": "In the current high-tech era, the growing popularity of e-healthcare has heightened the attention focused on data security against cyber-attacks. As digital medical images are transported over the public network, an intermediate degree of protection must be in place. One major technique is the implementation of encryption to safeguard medical images. This article recommends a new medical image encryption technology. This algorithm began with a simple application of advanced Vigenere technology, followed by the implementation of a deeply adapted genetic operator for color image encryption, with the intention of better integrating into the medical image encryption security sector. After vectorization of the original image, the first round of Vigenere control by two chaotic substitution tables attached to highly modified replacement functions is applied. The output vector is encoded in restricted ASCII code in order to obtain a genetic hybridization suitable for encryption of medical and color images. A strong chaining will be applied between the encrypted block and the following clear block in order to increase the impact of the avalanche effect and to protect the system against any differential attack. Simulations carried out on a large volume of images of different sizes and formats ensure that our approach is not exposed to known attacks. HIGHLIGHTS: The two rounds of our algorithm represent a large modification of a classical and a genetic operator. The main new features are ✓ First round ○ Vigenere upgrade ○ Selected simulations from the primary round ✓ Switching to reduced ASCII code ○ Two cross-over tables building process ○ Chaotic operation ASCII table ○ Output vector encryption ■ Detailed simulation study ■ Benchmarking with other recent algorithms.",

    "title": "Identifying and Mitigating Phishing Attack Threats in IoT Use Cases Using a Threat Modelling Approach.",
    "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) is a technology that enables our daily life objects to connect on the Internet and to send and receive data for a meaningful purpose. In recent years, IoT has led to many revolutions in almost every sector of our society. Nevertheless, security threats to IoT devices and networks are relentlessly disruptive, because of the proliferation of Internet technologies. Phishing is one of the most prevalent threats to all Internet users, in which attackers aim to fraudulently extract sensitive information of a user or system, using fictitious emails, websites, etc. With the rapid increase in IoT devices, attackers are targeting IoT devices such as security cameras, smart cars, etc., and perpetrating phishing attacks to gain control over such vulnerable devices for malicious purposes. In recent decades, such scams have been spreading, and they have become increasingly advanced over time. By following this trend, in this paper, we propose a threat modelling approach to identify and mitigate the cyber-threats that can cause phishing attacks. We considered two significant IoT use cases, i.e., smart autonomous vehicular system and smart home. The proposed work is carried out by applying the STRIDE threat modelling approach to both use cases, to disclose all the potential threats that may cause a phishing attack. The proposed threat modelling approach can support the IoT researchers, engineers, and IoT cyber-security policymakers in securing and protecting the potential threats in IoT devices and systems in the early design stages, to ensure the secure deployment of IoT devices in critical infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and fog computing architectures has introduced major security and cyber threats. Intrusion detection systems have become effective in monitoring network traffic and activities to identify anomalies that are indicative of attacks. However, constraints such as limited computing resources at fog nodes render conventional intrusion detection techniques impractical. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates stacked autoencoders, CatBoost, and an optimised transformer-CNN-LSTM ensemble tailored for intrusion detection in fog and IoT networks. Autoencoders extract robust features from high-dimensional traffic data while reducing the dimensionality of the efficiency at fog nodes. CatBoost refines features through predictive selection. The ensemble model combines self-attention, convolutions, and recurrence for comprehensive traffic analysis in the cloud. Evaluations of the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and AWID benchmarks demonstrate an accuracy of over 99% in detecting threats across traditional, hybrid enterprises and wireless environments. Integrated edge preprocessing and cloud-based ensemble learning pipelines enable efficient and accurate anomaly detection. The results highlight the viability of securing real-world fog and the IoT infrastructure against continuously evolving cyber-attacks.",

The Smart Transport Infrastructure (STI) era depends mainly on the IoT. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are being used to strengthen the STI smartness further. However, some decisions are very challenging due to the vast number of STI components and big data generated from STIs. Computation cost, communication overheads, and privacy issues are significant concerns for wide-scale ML adoption within STI. These issues can be addressed using Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain. FL can be used to address the issues of privacy preservation and handling big data generated in STI management and control. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that can store data while providing trust and integrity assurance. Blockchain can be a solution to data integrity and can add more security to the STI. This survey initially explores the vehicular network and STI in detail and sheds light on the blockchain and FL with real-world implementations. Then, FL and blockchain applications in the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) environment from security and privacy perspectives are discussed in detail. In the end, the paper focuses on the current research challenges and future research directions related to integrating FL and blockchain for vehicular networks.",

At the time of writing, there were no additional financial costs or technical skills required for implementing GDPR regulations but this could change in future data processing systems. There are significant potential costs for non-compliance with GDPR. Brexit is unlikely to have any effect on complying with GDPR requirements. The GDPR gives the public the right to access information and be informed of how and why it is processed. It is recommended that improved administrative processing capability to accommodate this requirement should be included in future data processing designs.

The importance of such projects for modern society is enormous, and there is a positive correlation between the size of infrastructure projects and the strength of the national economy. At the same time, it falls within the critical infrastructure sector most of the time. This work, taking into account the massive importance of investments made in the field of sports and the corresponding significance of the design and implementation of robust cybersecurity systems, presents an innovative optimization system for the design, performance, and adaptation of safeguards of technical projects, which require a high level of security standards. A realistic optimization system of low computational complexity is proposed and tested, dividing the problem into a series of subproblems of one-step optimization, which can be solved with great ease and without requirements on computational resources. The great innovation of the proposed system is that the separation is done so that the solution results from the optimal individual solutions of the subproblems without affecting the final result.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing demand for access to medical information via patients' portals. However, one of the challenges towards widespread utilisation of such service is maintaining the security of those portals. Recent reports show an alarming increase in cyber-attacks using crawlers. These software programs crawl web pages and are capable of executing various commands such as attacking web servers, cracking passwords, harvesting users' personal information, and testing the vulnerability of servers. The aim of this research is to develop a new effective model for detecting malicious crawlers based on their navigational behavior using machine-learning techniques. In this research, different methods of crawler detection were investigated. Log files of a sample of compromised web sites were analysed and the best features for the detection of crawlers were extracted. Then after testing and comparing several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Network and Decision Tree, the best model was developed using the most appropriate features and its accuracy was evaluated. Our analysis showed the SVM-based models can yield higher accuracy (f-measure = 0.97) comparing to Bayesian Network (f-measure = 0.88) and Decision Tree (f-measure = 0.95) and artificial neural network (ANN) (f-measure = 0.87)for detecting malicious crawlers. However, extracting proper features can increase the performance of the SVM (f-measure = 0.98), the Bayesian network (f-measure = 0.94) and the Decision Tree (f-measure = 0.96) and ANN (f-measure = 0.92). Security concerns are among the potential barriers to widespread utilisation of patient portals. Machine learning algorithms can be accurately used to detect malicious crawlers and enhance the security of sensitive patients' information. Selecting appropriate features for the development of these algorithms can remarkably increase their accuracy.",

But these resource-constrained IoT devices cannot be protected by existing security mechanisms against emerging cyber threats.

The proposed system employs publicly available datasets such as CIC-IDS 2017, CIC-IDS 2018, CIC-Bell DNS 2021, and NSL-KDD to present a robust detection framework. IRKO selects features, reducing the feature dimensions and hence isolating the most relevant attributes. The AConBN classifier then accurately classifies normal and intrusion traffic. Afterwards, optimization in the classification process is done by the SA-HHO algorithm, which provides the optimal weight values. Results are such that the IADCL framework detects cyberattacks with a high degree of accuracy, and the performance evaluations are made based on a number of key performance metrics. Conclusively, the proposed system has very good potential to protect smart healthcare IoT devices from cyber threats.",

    "abstract": "Due to the proliferation of contemporary computer-integrated systems and communication networks, there is more concern than ever regarding privacy, given the potential for sensitive data exploitation. A recent cyber-security research trend is to focus on security principles and develop the foundations for designing safety-critical systems. In this work, we investigated the problem of verifying current-state opacity in discrete event systems using labeled Petri nets. A system is current-state opaque provided that the current-state estimate cannot be revealed as a subset of secret states. We introduced a new sub-model of the system, named an observer net. The observer net have the same structure as the plant, but it is distinguished by the use of colored markers as well as simultaneous and recursive transition enabling and firing, which offer an efficient state estimation. We considered two settings of the proposed approach: an on-line setting, in which a current-state opacity algorithm is proposed. The algorithm waits for the occurrence of an observable event and determines if the current observation of a plant reveals the secret behaviour, as well as, an off-line setting, where the verification problem is solved based on a state estimator called a colored estimator. In this context, necessary and sufficient conditions for verifying opacity are developed with illustrative examples to demonstrate the presented approach.",

    "abstract": "Controller area network (CAN) are widely used in smart vehicles to realize information interactions between electronic control units and other devices in vehicles. Owing to an increase in external communication interfaces, the cybersecurity of in-vehicle CAN bus networks is threatened. In-vehicle CAN intrusion detection systems with high detection rates and low false-negative rates have become important security protection measures for automotive networks. The boundary of the current machine learning-based in-vehicle CAN bus intrusion detection algorithm to determine the anomalous behavior triggered by CAN messages is unclear, and a validity check is required after the intrusion detection algorithm is designed. To solve the low coverage rate problem in the process of validating intrusion detection algorithms, an in-vehicle CAN fuzz-testing message generation model, the field-associative mutation generation adversarial network (FAMGAN), is proposed. To improve the defects of high randomness in generating messages in traditional fuzz-testing algorithms, FAMGAN adopts field division based on a conditional random field and the field association method based on the Apriori algorithm. Experiments were conducted on a real car using a code-built intrusion detection algorithm. The results demonstrate that FAMGAN can efficiently generate anomalous CAN messages and evaluate the performance of an in-vehicle CAN intrusion detection algorithm.",

    "title": "Towards a contextual theory of Mobile Health Data Protection (MHDP): A realist perspective.",
    "abstract": "With the introduction of privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective data protection in mobile health (mHealth) is rapidly becoming a concern. However, we have a limited understanding of the contexts and mechanisms that affect the likelihood of failures and successes in mHealth data protection, and their subsequent impacts. In this review and theory development paper, we aim to address this critical knowledge gap. We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. To synthesize the evidence, we adopted a realist review approach and compiled the extracted information based on context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations. Out of an initial set of 611 records, 19 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included. Our findings indicate that the failures and successes in data protection and their impacts (effective mHealth interventions, data protection awareness, and adoption/use of mHealth systems) depend contingently upon a number of contextual factors (systems, users, tasks, services, geographic elements) and causal mechanisms (unauthorized access, device theft, loss, and sharing, lack of cyber-hygiene, and data protection concerns for failures, and trust building activity, secure and law compliant platforms, and perceived data protection, for successes). We conceptualized the CMO configurations to provide explanations for the reported failures and successes in data protection. For effective mHealth interventions, the dark side of system use (data breaches) must be mitigated and remediated. Our study offers a theoretical model that contextually explains how the mechanisms of success and failures work in mHealth.",

    "title": "Image steganography techniques for resisting statistical steganalysis attacks: A systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Information hiding in images has gained popularity. As image steganography gains relevance, techniques for detecting hidden messages have emerged. Statistical steganalysis mechanisms detect the presence of hidden secret messages in images, rendering images a prime target for cyber-attacks. Also, studies examining image steganography techniques are limited. This paper aims to fill the existing gap in extant literature on image steganography schemes capable of resisting statistical steganalysis attacks, by providing a comprehensive systematic literature review. This will ensure image steganography researchers and data protection practitioners are updated on current trends in information security assurance mechanisms. The study sampled 125 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, Science Direct, and Wiley. Using PRISMA, articles were synthesized and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A comprehensive discussion on image steganography techniques in terms of their robustness against well-known universal statistical steganalysis attacks including Regular-Singular (RS) and Chi-Square (X2) are provided. Trends in publication, techniques and methods, performance evaluation metrics, and security impacts were discussed. Extensive comparisons were drawn among existing techniques to evaluate their merits and limitations. It was observed that Generative Adversarial Networks dominate image steganography techniques and have become the preferred method by scholars within the domain. Artificial intelligence-powered algorithms including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms are recently dominating image steganography research as they enhance security. The implication is that previously preferred traditional techniques such as LSB algorithms are receiving less attention. Future Research may consider emerging technologies like blockchain technology, artificial neural networks, and biometric and facial recognition technologies to improve the robustness and security capabilities of image steganography applications.",

    "title": "Examining the Suitability of NetFlow Features in Detecting IoT Network Intrusions.",
    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a substantial increase in cyberattacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their networks. Such attacks pose a significant threat to organizational security and user privacy. Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) in Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) has proven advantageous in countering novel zero-day attacks. However, the performance of such systems relies on several factors, one of which is prediction time. Processing speed in anomaly-based NIDS depends on a few elements, including the number of features fed to the ML model. NetFlow, a networking industry-standard protocol, offers many features that can be used to predict malicious attacks accurately. This paper examines NetFlow features and assesses their suitability in classifying network traffic. Our paper presents a model that detects attacks with (98-100%) accuracy using as few as 13 features. This study was conducted using a large dataset of over 16 million records released in 2021.",

    "title": "Android Spyware Detection Using Machine Learning: A Novel Dataset.",
    "abstract": "Smartphones are an essential part of all aspects of our lives. Socially, politically, and commercially, there is almost complete reliance on smartphones as a communication tool, a source of information, and for entertainment. Rapid developments in the world of information and cyber security have necessitated close attention to the privacy and protection of smartphone data. Spyware detection systems have recently been developed as a promising and encouraging solution for smartphone users' privacy protection. The Android operating system is the most widely used worldwide, making it a significant target for many parties interested in targeting smartphone users' privacy. This paper introduces a novel dataset collected in a realistic environment, obtained through a novel data collection methodology based on a unified activity list. The data are divided into three main classes: the first class represents normal smartphone traffic; the second class represents traffic data for the spyware installation process; finally, the third class represents spyware operation traffic data. The random forest classification algorithm was adopted to validate this dataset and the proposed model. Two methodologies were adopted for data classification: binary-class and multi-class classification. Good results were achieved in terms of accuracy. The overall average accuracy was 79% for the binary-class classification, and 77% for the multi-class classification. In the multi-class approach, the detection accuracy for spyware systems (UMobix, TheWiSPY, MobileSPY, FlexiSPY, and mSPY) was 90%, 83.7%, 69.3%, 69.2%, and 73.4%, respectively; in binary-class classification, the detection accuracy for spyware systems (UMobix, TheWiSPY, MobileSPY, FlexiSPY, and mSPY) was 93.9%, 85.63%, 71%, 72.3%, and 75.96%; respectively.",

    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of cyber attacks threaten us personally and professionally. Cyber crimes include obtaining sensitive information (medical or financial) but may extend to organising heinous crimes including murders and aggravated sexual assaults. A major vector of cyber crimes is brute force attacks on secured shell servers. This research highlights the prevalence of the intensity of brute force attacks on secured shell servers via quali-quantitative analysis of cyber attacks. The brute force attacks were recorded over a period of 20 days with the help of logs taken from five dedicated servers installed in a production environment. There were a minimum of 6470 and maximum of 22,715 attacks on a server per day. The total number of attacks on all the servers during the study period was 1,065,920. The brute force attacks were mainly targeted at the service network accounts. Growth of the field of cyber forensics is the optimal solution to prevent the malicious use of internet services and the commissioning of crimes by this means.",

    "title": "Susceptibility and resilience to cyber threat: Findings from a scenario decision program to measure secure and insecure computing behavior.",
    "abstract": "Interest in the individual differences underlying end user computer security behavior has led to the development of a multidisciplinary field of research known as behavioral information security. An important gap in knowledge and the motivation for this research is the development of ways to measure secure and insecure cyber behavior for research and eventually practice. Here we report a study designed to develop a technique for assessing secure and insecure cyber behavior for broad research use. The Susceptibility and Resilience to Cyber Threat (SRCT) is an immersive scenario decision program. The SRCT measures susceptibility to cyber threat and malicious behavior as well protective resilience actions via participant responses/decisions to emails, interactions with security dialogs, and computer actions in a real-world simulation. Data were collected from a sample of 190 adults (76.3% female), between the ages of 18-61 (mean age = 26.12). Personality, behavioral tendencies, and cognitive preferences were measured with standard previously validated protocols and self-report measures. Factor analysis suggested a 5 item secure actions scale and a 9 item insecure actions scale as viable to extract from the SRCT responses. Statistically analyzable distributions of secure and insecure cyber behaviors were obtained, and these subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency as hypothesized. Associations between SRCT scales and other indices of cyber behavior, as well as self-reported personality, were lower than predicted, suggesting that past research reporting links between self-reports of personality and self-reported cyber-behavior may be overestimating the links for actual cyber actions. However, our exploratory analyses suggest discrepancies between self-report and actions in the SRCT may be an interesting avenue to explore. Overall, results were consistent with theorizing and suggest the technique is viable as a construct measure in future research or as an outcome variable in experimental intervention designs.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Interventions in Health Care Organizations in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Health care organizations globally have seen a significant increase in the frequency of cyberattacks in recent years. Cyberattacks cause massive disruptions to health service delivery and directly impact patient safety through disruption and treatment delays. Given the increasing number of cyberattacks in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a need to explore the interventions put in place to plan for cyberattacks and develop cyber resilience. This study aimed to describe cybersecurity interventions, defined as any intervention to improve cybersecurity in a health care organization, including but not limited to organizational strategy(ies); policy(ies); protocol(s), incident plan(s), or assessment process(es); framework(s) or guidelines; and emergency planning, implemented in LMICs to date and to evaluate their impact on the likelihood and impact of attacks. The secondary objective was to describe the main barriers and facilitators for the implementation of such interventions, where reported. A systematic search of the literature published between January 2017 and July 2024 was performed on Ovid Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Scopus using a combination of controlled terms and free text. A search of the gray literature within the same time parameters was undertaken on the websites of relevant stakeholder organizations to identify possible additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. Findings from included papers were mapped against the dimensions of the Essentials of Cybersecurity in Health Care Organizations (ECHO) framework and presented as a narrative synthesis. We included 20 studies in this review. The sample size of the majority of studies (13/20, 65%) was 1 facility to 5 facilities, and the studies were conducted in 14 countries. Studies were categorized into the thematic dimensions of the ECHO framework, including context; governance; organizational strategy; risk management; awareness, education, and training; and technical capabilities. Few studies (6/20, 30%) discussed cybersecurity intervention(s) as the primary focus of the paper; therefore, information on intervention(s) implemented had to be deduced. There was no attempt to report on the impact and outcomes in all papers except one. Facilitators and barriers identified were grouped and presented across national or regional, organizational, and individual staff levels. This scoping review's findings highlight the limited body of research published on cybersecurity interventions implemented in health care organizations in LMICs and large heterogeneity across existing studies in interventions, research objectives, methods, and outcome measures used. Although complex and challenging, future research should specifically focus on the evaluation of cybersecurity interventions and their impact in order to build a robust evidence base to inform evidence-based policy and practice.",

    "title": "Data Security and Privacy in Apps for Dementia: An Analysis of Existing Privacy Policies.",
    "abstract": "Despite tremendous growth in the number of health applications (apps), little is known about how well these apps protect their users' health-related data. This gap in knowledge is of particular concern for apps targeting people with dementia, whose cognitive impairment puts them at increased risk of privacy breaches. In this article, we determine how many dementia apps have privacy policies and how well they protect user data. Our analysis included all iPhone apps that matched the search terms \"medical + dementia\" or \"health & fitness + dementia\" and collected user-generated content. We evaluated all available privacy policies for these apps based on criteria that systematically measure how individual user data is handled. Seventy-two apps met the above search teams and collected user data. Of these, only 33 (46%) had an available privacy policy. Nineteen of the 33 with policies (58%) were specific to the app in question, and 25 (76%) specified how individual-user as opposed to aggregate data would be handled. Among these, there was a preponderance of missing information, the majority acknowledged collecting individual data for internal purposes, and most admitted to instances in which they would share user data with outside parties. At present, the majority of health apps focused on dementia lack a privacy policy, and those that do exist lack clarity. Bolstering safeguards and improving communication about privacy protections will help facilitate consumer trust in apps, thereby enabling more widespread and meaningful use by people with dementia and those involved in their care.",

    "abstract": "The Intelligent Medical Diagnosis System (IMDS) has been targeted by the cyber attackers, who aim to damage the Healthcare Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). This research is motivated by the recent cyber attacks happened worldwide that have resulted in the compromise of medical diagnosis records. This study was conducted to demonstrate how the IMDS could be attacked and diagnosis records compromised (i.e. heart disease) and suggest a list of security defence strategies to prevent against such attacks. This research developed an IMDS simulation platform by implementing the OpenEMR system. A Cardiac Diagnosis Component is then added to the IMDS. The IMDS is fed with the ECG data (retrieved from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017). This research then launched systematic ethical hacking, which was tailored to target IMDS diagnosis records. The systematic hacking was based on the NIST ethical hacking method and followed an attack pathway, starting from identifying the entry points of the medical websites, then propagating to gain access to the server, with the ultimate aim of modifying the heart disease diagnosis records. The hacking was successful. Four major vulnerabilities (i.e. broken authentication, broken access control, security misconfiguration and using components with known vulnerabilities) were identified in the simulated IMDS and the cardiac diagnosis records were compromised. This research then proposed a list of security defence strategies to prevent such attacks at each possible attacking points along the attacking pathway. This research demonstrated a systematic ethical hacking to the IMDS, identified four major vulnerabilities and proposed the security defence pathways. It provided novel insights into the protection of IMDS and will benefit researchers in the community to conduct further research in security defence of IMDS.",

    "abstract": "The generation of the mix-based expansion of modern power grids has urged the utilization of digital infrastructures. The introduction of Substation Automation Systems (SAS), advanced networks and communication technologies have drastically increased the complexity of the power system, which could prone the entire power network to hackers. The exploitation of the cyber security vulnerabilities by an attacker may result in devastating consequences and can leave millions of people in severe power outage. To resolve this issue, this paper presents a network model developed in OPNET that has been subjected to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to demonstrate cyber security aspect of an international electrotechnical commission (IEC) 61850 based digital substations. The attack scenarios have exhibited significant increases in the system delay and the prevention of messages, i.e., Generic Object-Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Values (SMV), from being transmitted within an acceptable time frame. In addition to that, it may cause malfunction of the devices such as unresponsiveness of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), which could eventually lead to catastrophic scenarios, especially under different fault conditions. The simulation results of this work focus on the DoS attack made on SAS. A detailed set of rigorous case studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effects of these attacks.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of genomic research and its integration into clinical practice, as they become international-even global-endeavors, has brought us to a place where scientists and clinicians may now only ignore the rules governing international data sharing at their own peril. Open data policies, on the one hand, increasingly require custodians of others' genomic data to make it as widely available as feasible, including to researchers in other countries. Data protection law, on the other, has become a significant hurdle to the sharing of personal data across jurisdictional borders. The space between these two competing duties is narrowing. In contrast with the other texts in this volume, which explore the present and future of data sharing and data protection, this article's focus is on the past. It centres on the historical development of the data protection rules regarding the international transfer of personal data up to the present. The article's aim is to bring into focus the underlying objectives that have influenced and that will continue to influence the way that data protection rules are applied to the fields of genomics and health, as well as future developments in data protection generally. The first part of this article describes the development of international data-sharing data protection rules since 1970. The second considers difficulties in applying general data protection rules to the specific context of genomics and health. The third and final part compares the options available to comply with the international transfer restrictions set out in the standard-setting EU General Data Protection Regulation from a genomics perspective.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the extensive integration of technology into the healthcare system, cybersecurity incidents have become an increasing challenge for the healthcare industry. Recent examples include WannaCry, a nontargeted ransomware attack on more than 150 countries worldwide that temporarily crippled parts of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, and the 2016 ransomware attack on Los Angeles's Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. The attacks cost millions of dollars in lost revenue and fines, as well as significant reputational damage. Efforts are needed to devise tools that allow experts to more accurately quantify the actual impact of such events on both individual patients and healthcare systems as a whole. While the United States has robust disaster preparedness and response systems integrated throughout the healthcare and government sectors, the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat against healthcare entities is outpacing existing countermeasures and challenges in the \"all-hazards\" disaster preparedness paradigm. Further epidemiologic research of clinical cybersecurity attacks and their effects on patient care and clinical outcomes is necessary to prevent and mitigate future attacks.",

This is exacerbated by the long-term adoption of a 'fortress mentality' towards cyber security, and by the attitude of many of our cyber-security professionals, who speak a different language when it comes to communicating cyber-security events to senior executives. The prevailing approaches to cyber security have clearly failed. Almost every week another serious, targeted cyber intrusion is reported, but reported intrusions are only the tip of the iceberg. Why have we got it so wrong? It must be acknowledged that cyber security is no longer the domain of cyber-security experts alone. Many more of us at various levels of leadership must understand, and be more deeply engaged in, the cyber-security challenge if we are to deal with the threat holistically and effectively. Governments cannot combat the cyber threat alone, particularly the so-called advanced persistent threat; they must work closely with industry as trusted partners. Industry will be the 'boots on the ground' in cyber security, but there are challenges to building this relationship, which must be based on sound principles.",

    "title": "The Security of Big Data in Fog-Enabled IoT Applications Including Blockchain: A Survey.",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.",

    "title": "An Efficient Framework for Securing the Smart City Communication Networks.",
    "abstract": "Recently, smart cities have increasingly been experiencing an evolution to improve the lifestyle of citizens and society. These emerge from the innovation of information and communication technologies (ICT) which are able to create a new economic and social opportunities. However, there are several challenges regarding our security and expectation of privacy. People are already involved and interconnected by using smart phones and other appliances. In many cities, smart energy meters, smart devices, and security appliances have recently been standardized. Full connectivity between public venues, homes, cares, and some other social systems are on their way to be applied, which are known as Internet of Things. In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of security in smart city communication networks by using a new framework and scheme that provide an authentication and high confidentiality of data. The smart city system can achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key schemes between smart meters and the control center in order to secure a two-way communication channel. In our extensive simulation, we investigated and evaluated the security performance of the smart city communication network with and without our proposed scheme in terms of throughput, latency, load, and traffic received packet per seconds. Furthermore, we implemented and applied a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and network intrusion detection system (NIDS) in our proposed technique to validate and measure the security requirements maintaining the constrained resources.",

    "abstract": "Modern Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) are often controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) which manage their operation and maintain a reliable water supply. As such, and with the cyber layer becoming a central component of WDS operations, these systems are at a greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks. This paper offers a model-based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of WDSs combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically based rules alone. The results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving the best-known performance when tested on the data published in the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) competition (http://www.batadal.net).",

    "abstract": "Recently, ransomware attacks have been among the major threats that target a wide range of Internet and mobile users throughout the world, especially critical cyber physical systems. Due to its unique characteristics, ransomware has attracted the attention of security professionals and researchers toward achieving safer and higher assurance systems that can effectively detect and prevent such attacks. The state-of-the-art crypto ransomware early detection models rely on specific data acquired during the runtime of an attack's lifecycle. However, the evasive mechanisms that these attacks employ to avoid detection often nullify the solutions that are currently in place. More effort is needed to keep up with an attacks' momentum to take the current security defenses to the next level. This survey is devoted to exploring and analyzing the state-of-the-art in ransomware attack detection toward facilitating the research community that endeavors to disrupt this very critical and escalating ransomware problem. The focus is on crypto ransomware as the most prevalent, destructive, and challenging variation. The approaches and open issues pertaining to ransomware detection modeling are reviewed to establish recommendations for future research directions and scope.",

To encode the digital data and utilize the unique properties of DNA, like stability and durability, synthetic DNA sequences are offered as a promising alternative by DNA encoding schemes. This study enlightens the exploration of DNA's potential for encoding in evolving cyber security. Based on the systematic literature review, this paper provides a discussion on the challenges, pros, and directions for future work. We analyzed the current trends and new innovations in methodology, security attacks, the implementation of tools, and different metrics to measure. Various tools, such as Mathematica, MATLAB, NIST test suite, and Coludsim, were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and obtain results.

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis is a critical threat to cryptosystems on the Internet of Things and in relation to embedded devices, and appropriate side-channel countermeasure must be required for physical security. A combined countermeasure approach employing first-order masking and desynchronization simultaneously is a general and cost-efficient approach to counteracting side-channel analysis. With the development of side-channel countermeasures, there are plenty of advanced attacks introduced to defeat such countermeasures. At CARDIS 2013, Belgarric et al. first proposed time-frequency analysis, a promising attack regarding the complexity of computation and memory compared to other attacks, such as conventional second-order side-channel analysis after synchronization. Nevertheless, their time-frequency analysis seems to have lower performance than expected against some datasets protected by combined countermeasures. It is therefore required to study the factors that affect the performance of time-frequency analysis. In this paper, we investigate Belgarric et al.'s time-frequency analysis and conduct a mathematical analysis in regard to the preprocessing of frequency information for second-order side-channel analysis. Based on this analysis, we claim that zero-mean preprocessing enhances the performance of time-frequency analysis. We verify that our analysis is valid through experimental results from two datasets, which are different types of first-order masked Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) software implementations. The experimental results show that time-frequency analysis with zero-mean preprocessing seems to have an enhanced or complementary performance compared to the analysis without preprocessing.",

In this paper, a novel epidemic model, SILS( usceptible, nfected, ow-energy, usceptible), considering the removal, charging and reinfection process of WRSNs is proposed. Subsequently, the local and global stabilities of disease-free and epidemic equilibrium points are analyzed and simulated after obtaining the basic reproductive number R0. Detailedly, the simulations further reveal the unique characteristics of SILS when it tends to being stable, and the relationship between the charging rate and R0. Furthermore, the attack-defense game between malware and WRSNs is constructed and the optimal strategies of both players are obtained. Consequently, in the case of R0<1 and R0>1, the validity of the optimal strategies is verified by comparing with the non-optimal control group in the evolution of sensor nodes and accumulated cost.",

    "title": "Contextualized Filtering for Shared Cyber Threat Information.",
    "abstract": "Cyber threat information sharing is an imperative process towards achieving collaborative security, but it poses several challenges. One crucial challenge is the plethora of shared threat information. Therefore, there is a need to advance filtering of such information. While the state-of-the-art in filtering relies primarily on keyword- and domain-based searching, these approaches require sizable human involvement and rarely available domain expertise. Recent research revealed the need for harvesting of business information to fill the gap in filtering, albeit it resulted in providing coarse-grained filtering based on the utilization of such information. This paper presents a novel contextualized filtering approach that exploits standardized and multi-level contextual information of business processes. The contextual information describes the conditions under which a given threat information is actionable from an organization perspective. Therefore, it can automate filtering by measuring the equivalence between the context of the shared threat information and the context of the consuming organization. The paper directly contributes to filtering challenge and indirectly to automated customized threat information sharing. Moreover, the paper proposes the architecture of a cyber threat information sharing ecosystem that operates according to the proposed filtering approach and defines the characteristics that are advantageous to filtering approaches. Implementation of the proposed approach can support compliance with the Special Publication 800-150 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.",

Early prediction of kidney cancer helps doctors start proper therapy and treatment for the patients, preventing kidney tumors and renal transplantation. With the adaptation of artificial intelligence, automated tools empowered with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms can predict cancers. In this study, the proposed model used the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based transfer learning technique with different deep learning algorithms to predict kidney cancer in its early stages, and for the patient's data security, the proposed model incorporates blockchain technology-based private clouds and transfer-learning trained models. To predict kidney cancer, the proposed model used biopsies of cancerous kidneys consisting of three classes. The proposed model achieved the highest training accuracy and prediction accuracy of 99.8% and 99.20%, respectively, empowered with data augmentation and without augmentation, and the proposed model achieved 93.75% prediction accuracy during validation. Transfer learning provides a promising framework with the combination of IoMT technologies and blockchain technology layers to enhance the diagnosing capabilities of kidney cancer.",

In contrast, these architectures constitute a system to realize the concept of smart cities and, ultimately, a smart planet. The adoption of these smart devices expands to different cyber-physical systems in smart city architecture, i.e., smart houses, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, smart agriculture, etc. The edge of the network connects these smart devices (sensors, aggregators, and actuators) that can operate in the physical environment and collects the data, which is further used to make an informed decision through actuation. Here, the security of these devices is immensely important, specifically from an authentication standpoint, as in the case of unauthenticated/malicious assets, the whole infrastructure would be at stake. We provide an updated review of authentication mechanisms by categorizing centralized and distributed architectures. We discuss the security issues regarding the authentication of these IoT-enabled smart devices. We evaluate and analyze the study of the proposed literature schemes that pose authentication challenges in terms of computational costs, communication overheads, and models applied to attain robustness. Hence, lightweight solutions in managing, maintaining, processing, and storing authentication data of IoT-enabled assets are an urgent need. From an integration perspective, cloud computing has provided strong support. In contrast, decentralized ledger technology, i.e., blockchain, light-weight cryptosystems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, are the areas with much more to explore. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges, which will eventually help address the ambiguities for improvement.",

    "abstract": "One of the main problems of modern research concerns the optimal design of solutions to address cybersecurity problems, with methods that provide the ability to choose an objective function different from that of the classic problem of more economical design while allowing the use of constraints on any possible variable during planning, including financial resources. The number of corresponding solutions concerns the issue of optimal design of security strategies with a simulation that lies in game theory, with players, the defender on one side defending the system managing the available options of strategic solutions, and the attacker, who chooses the way to strike the system, based on some attack scenarios that cannot be easily predicted. The inherent difficulty of implementing the proposed solutions lies in the combined explosion of all possible combinations that make up the solution space, the complete examination of which requires a lot of computational time and computing resources, to the point that their use becomes unprofitable. This weakness is attributed to even minor problems, and the possible strategies available to the defender are finite but at the same time numerous. To solve the abovementioned problem, the work proposes a hybrid system that aims to identify the best possible approach in the theoretically optimal solution in a short time and with minimal computing resources. Specifically, a heuristic optimization methodology is used with overlapping answers between two contiguous neighborhoods based on the Bloom Filters structure that supports fast listings and searches. This methodology, which is evaluated in optimizing safety strategies in the sports industry, brings about 40% optimization.",

Traditional standard encryption algorithms for data protection are designed based on a viewpoint of system architecture rather than a viewpoint of end-users. As such encryption algorithms are transferring the protection on the data to the protection on the keys, data safety, and privacy will be compromised once the key is exposed. In this paper, we propose a secure data storage and sharing method consisted of a selective encryption algorithm combined with fragmentation and dispersion to protect the data safety and privacy even when both transmission media (e.g. cloud servers) and keys are compromised. This method is based on a user-centric design that protects the data on a trusted device such as the end-users' smartphone and lets the end-user control the access for data sharing. We also evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a smartphone platform to prove efficiency.",

We propose a new attacker model, based on dynamic optimization, where we demonstrate that large, initial, fixed costs of exploit development induce attackers to delay implementation and deployment of exploits of vulnerabilities. The theoretical model predicts that mass attackers will preferably (i) exploit only one vulnerability per software version, (ii) largely include only vulnerabilities requiring low attack complexity, and (iii) be slow at trying to weaponize new vulnerabilities . These predictions are empirically validated on a large data set of observed massed attacks launched against a large collection of information systems. Findings in this article allow cyber risk managers to better concentrate their efforts for vulnerability management, and set a new theoretical and empirical basis for further research defining attacker (offensive) processes.",

    "abstract": "The Android platform accounts for 85% of the global smartphone operating-system market share, and recently, it has also been installed on Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices such as wearable devices and vehicles. These Android-based devices store various personal information such as user IDs, addresses, and payment information and device usage data when providing convenient functions to users. Insufficient security for the management and deletion of data stored in the device can lead to various cyber security threats such as personal information leakage and identity theft. Therefore, research on the protection of personal information stored in the device is very important. However, there is a limitation that the current research for protection of personal information on the existing Android platform was only conducted on Android platform 6 or lower. In this paper, we analyze the deleted data remaining on the device and the possibility of recovery to improve user privacy for smartphones using Android platforms 9 and 10. The deleted data analysis is performed based on three data deletion scenarios: data deletion using the app's own function, data deletion using the system app's data and cache deletion function, and uninstallation of installed apps. It demonstrates the potential user privacy problems that can occur when using Android platforms 9 and 10 due to the leakage of recovered data. It also highlights the need for improving the security of personal user information by erasing the traces of deleted data that remain in the journal area and directory entry area of the filesystem used in Android platforms 9 and 10.",

Thus far, the uncertain outcomes addressed in the paradigm of new technologies as social experiments have been mostly safety-related, meaning that potential harm is caused by the design plus accidental events in the environment. In some domains, such as cyberspace, adversarial agents (attackers) may be at least as important when it comes to undesirable effects of deployed technologies. In such cases, conditions for responsible experimentation may need to be implemented differently, as attackers behave strategically rather than probabilistically. In this contribution, we outline how adversarial aspects are already taken into account in technology deployment in the field of cyber security, and what the paradigm of new technologies as social experiments can learn from this. In particular, we show the importance of adversarial roles in social experiments with new technologies.",

    "title": "PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems.",
    "abstract": "This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.",

    "title": "Improving the redistribution of the security lessons in healthcare: An evaluation of the Generic Security Template.",
    "abstract": "The recurrence of past security breaches in healthcare showed that lessons had not been effectively learned across different healthcare organisations. Recent studies have identified the need to improve learning from incidents and to share security knowledge to prevent future attacks. Generic Security Templates (GSTs) have been proposed to facilitate this knowledge transfer. The objective of this paper is to evaluate whether potential users in healthcare organisations can exploit the GST technique to share lessons learned from security incidents. We conducted a series of case studies to evaluate GSTs. In particular, we used a GST for a security incident in the US Veterans' Affairs Administration to explore whether security lessons could be applied in a very different Chinese healthcare organisation. The results showed that Chinese security professional accepted the use of GSTs and that cyber security lessons could be transferred to a Chinese healthcare organisation using this approach. The users also identified the weaknesses and strengths of GSTs, providing suggestions for future improvements. Generic Security Templates can be used to redistribute lessons learned from security incidents. Sharing cyber security lessons helps organisations consider their own practices and assess whether applicable security standards address concerns raised in previous breaches in other countries. The experience gained from this study provides the basis for future work in conducting similar studies in other healthcare organisations.",

    "title": "Privacy-preserving cancer type prediction with homomorphic encryption.",
    "abstract": "Cancer genomics tailors diagnosis and treatment based on an individual's genetic information and is the crux of precision medicine. However, analysis and maintenance of high volume of genetic mutation data to build a machine learning (ML) model to predict the cancer type is a computationally expensive task and is often outsourced to powerful cloud servers, raising critical privacy concerns for patients' data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data, thus, providing cryptographic guarantees to protect privacy. But restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this work, we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer type prediction using a dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic mutations from 2713 patients for several cancer types by building a highly accurate ML model and then implementing its privacy preserving version in HE. Our solution for cancer type inference encodes somatic mutations based on their impact on the cancer genomes into the feature space and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. We propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for HE-based model. Our final model achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve improving accuracy from 70.08 to 83.61% , being 550 times faster than the standard matrix multiplication-based privacy-preserving models.

    "title": "A blockchain-based lightweight identity authentication scheme for the IEDs of security and stability control system.",
    "abstract": "As an important part of the second defense line of the power system, the Security and Stability Control System (SSCS) is of great significance to ensure the reliable operation of the power system. However, SSCS still lacks an effective security mechanism and is easily accessed by attackers, thus posing a threat to the stable and reliable operation of the power system. To tackle this issue, we propose a blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) of SSCS. We first propose an identity authentication system model for IEDs and design the deployment of consortium chain nodes on IEDs, with architectural characteristics of SSCS and the working scenario of IEDs taken into consideration. The consortium chain is used to store credentials required for authentication, ensuring that they are tamper-proof. We combine IP address, port number and physical ID, and propose the unique identification of IEDs, with a data structure designed for the identification. We also propose a lightweight identity authentication method based on renewable hash chains, with hash chains used as one-time authentication passwords, and introduce a renewal mechanism of hash chains. Further, the detailed processes of registration and authentication phase are designed. Finally, the security analysis shows that our identity authentication scheme can resist various attacks, and the feasibility of our scheme is verified by experiments.",

    "title": "Exploration of Mobile Device Behavior for Mitigating Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): A Systematic Literature Review and Conceptual Framework.",
    "abstract": "During the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, computer security, and cyber-attacks have all grown rapidly on a large scale. Examples of IoT include mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Attacks can take place that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the information. One attack that occurs is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Attackers can manipulate a device's behavior, applications, and services. Such manipulations lead to signification of a deviation from a known behavioral baseline for smartphones. In this study, the authors present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide a survey of the existing literature on APT defense mechanisms, find research gaps, and recommend future directions. The scope of this SLR covers a detailed analysis of most cybersecurity defense mechanisms and cutting-edge solutions. In this research, 112 papers published from 2011 until 2022 were analyzed. This review has explored different approaches used in cybersecurity and their effectiveness in defending against APT attacks. In a conclusion, we recommended a Situational Awareness (SA) model known as Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) to provide a comprehensive solution to monitor the device's behavior for APT mitigation.",

    "title": "Security enhanced multi-factor biometric authentication scheme using bio-hash function.",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of personal information and wireless communication technology, user authentication schemes have been crucial to ensure that wireless communications are secure. As such, various authentication schemes with multi-factor authentication have been proposed to improve the security of electronic communications. Multi-factor authentication involves the use of passwords, smart cards, and various biometrics to provide users with the utmost privacy and data protection. Cao and Ge analyzed various authentication schemes and found that Younghwa An's scheme was susceptible to a replay attack where an adversary masquerades as a legal server and a user masquerading attack where user anonymity is not provided, allowing an adversary to execute a password change process by intercepting the user's ID during login. Cao and Ge improved upon Younghwa An's scheme, but various security problems remained. This study demonstrates that Cao and Ge's scheme is susceptible to a biometric recognition error, slow wrong password detection, off-line password attack, user impersonation attack, ID guessing attack, a DoS attack, and that their scheme cannot provide session key agreement. Then, to address all weaknesses identified in Cao and Ge's scheme, this study proposes a security enhanced multi-factor biometric authentication scheme and provides a security analysis and formal analysis using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. Finally, the efficiency analysis reveals that the proposed scheme can protect against several possible types of attacks with only a slightly high computational cost.",

    "abstract": "An electronic health (e-health) system, such as a medical cyber-physical system, offers a number of benefits (e.g. inform medical diagnosis). There are, however, a number of considerations in the implementation of the medical cyber-physical system, such as the integrity of medical / healthcare data (e.g. manipulated data can result in misdiagnosis). A number of digital signature schemes have been proposed in recent years to mitigate some of these challenges. However, the security of existing signatures is mostly based on conventional difficult mathematical problems, which are known to be insecure against quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a certificateless signature scheme, based on NTRU lattice. The latter is based on the difficulty of small integer solutions on the NTRU lattice, and is known to be quantum attack resilience. Security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significantly reduced communication and computation costs in comparison to two other competing quantum resilience schemes, while being quantum attack resilience.",

    "title": "Continuous Authentication against Collusion Attacks.",
    "abstract": "As mobile devices become more and more popular, users gain many conveniences. It has also made smartphone makers install new software and prebuilt hardware on their products, including many kinds of sensors. With improved storage and computing power, users also become accustomed to storing and interacting with personally sensitive information. Due to convenience and efficiency, mobile devices use gait authentication widely. In recent years, protecting the information security of mobile devices has become increasingly important. It has become a hot research area because smartphones are vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access. This paper proposes a novel attack model called a collusion attack. Firstly, we study the imitation attack in the general state and its results and propose and verify the feasibility of our attack. We propose a collusion attack model and train participants with quantified action specifications. The results demonstrate that our attack increases the attacker's false match rate only using an acceleration sensor in some systems sensor. Furthermore, we propose a multi-cycle defense model based on acceleration direction changes to improve the robustness of smartphone-based gait authentication methods against such attacks. Experimental results show that our defense model can significantly reduce the attacker's success rate.",

    "abstract": "Cyber security has become increasingly challenging due to the proliferation of the Internet of things (IoT), where a massive number of tiny, smart devices push trillion bytes of data to the Internet. However, these devices possess various security flaws resulting from the lack of defense mechanisms and hardware security support, therefore making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, IoT gateways provide very limited security features to detect such threats, especially the absence of intrusion detection methods powered by deep learning. Indeed, deep learning models require high computational power that exceeds the capacity of these gateways. In this paper, we introduce Realguard, an DNN-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) directly operated on local gateways to protect IoT devices within the network. The superiority of our proposal is that it can accurately detect multiple cyber attacks in real time with a small computational footprint. This is achieved by a lightweight feature extraction mechanism and an efficient attack detection model powered by deep neural networks. Our evaluations on practical datasets indicate that Realguard could detect ten types of attacks (e.g., port scan, Botnet, and FTP-Patator) in real time with an average accuracy of 99.57%, whereas the best of our competitors is 98.85%. Furthermore, our proposal effectively operates on resource-constraint gateways (Raspberry PI) at a high packet processing rate reported about 10.600 packets per second.",

In the terminal security research, in addition to the security enhancement of terminal entities, the security status evaluation of terminal security has also become an independent subset of the security research in the IoT field. However, it should also be noted that the security attributes of IoT terminals can include many aspects, so judging the security of IoT terminals based on the overall security form is not enough for the security of terminal entities. This paper introduces the concept of volatility from the overall situation assessment to the meta attributes that constitute the overall security situation, and preliminarily realizes the construction of a concise model based on historical data to judge the meta attributes that may affect the overall security in the future. At the same time, a concise verification system is built based on the application scenario of the power IoT terminals currently under research to preliminarily realize trend prediction, further expand the trust evaluation of IoT terminals, and clarify the direction of further research.",

    "title": "Pricing of cyber insurance premiums using a Markov-based dynamic model with clustering structure.",
    "abstract": "Cyber insurance is a risk management option to cover financial losses caused by cyberattacks. Researchers have focused their attention on cyber insurance during the last decade. One of the primary issues related to cyber insurance is estimating the premium. The effect of network topology has been heavily explored in the previous three years in cyber risk modeling. However, none of the approaches has assessed the influence of clustering structures. Numerous earlier investigations have indicated that internal links within a cluster reduce transmission speed or efficacy. As a result, the clustering coefficient metric becomes crucial in understanding the effectiveness of viral transmission. We provide a modified Markov-based dynamic model in this paper that incorporates the influence of the clustering structure on calculating cyber insurance premiums. The objective is to create less expensive and less homogenous premiums by combining criteria other than degrees. This research proposes a novel method for calculating premiums that gives a competitive market price. We integrated the epidemic inhibition function into the Markov-based model by considering three functions: quadratic, linear, and exponential. Theoretical and numerical evaluations of regular networks suggested that premiums were more realistic than premiums without clustering. Validation on a real network showed a significant improvement in premiums compared to premiums without the clustering structure component despite some variations. Furthermore, the three functions demonstrated very high correlations between the premium, the total inhibition function of neighbors, and the speed of the inhibition function. Thus, the proposed method can provide application flexibility by adapting to specific company requirements and network configurations.",

This characteristic has recently been highlighted as a key concern in the functioning of modern network-based combat systems in research on combat effect analysis. In this paper, a novel iscrete-event-system-specification-based yber- lectronic arfare M& (D-CEWS) was first proposed as an integrated framework for analyzing communication effects and engagement effects on cyber-electronic warfare threats and related countermeasures that may occur within drones. Accordingly, for the first time, based on communication metrics in tactical ad hoc networks, an analysis was conducted on the engagement effect of blue forces by major wireless threats, such as multi-layered jamming, routing attacks, and network worms. In addition, the correlations and response logics between competitive agents were also analyzed in order to recognize the efficiency of mutual engagements between them based on the communication system incapacitation scenarios for diverse wireless threats. As a result, the damage effect by the cyber-electronic warfare threat, which could not be considered in the existing military M&S, could be calculated according to the PDR (packet delivery ratio) and related malicious pool rate change in the combat area, and the relevance with various threats by a quantifiable mission attribute given to swarming drones could also be additionally secured.",

    "abstract": "Digitization in healthcare systems, with the wid adoption of Electronic Health Records, connected medical devices, software and systems providing efficient healthcare service delivery and management. On the other hand, the use of these systems has significantly increased cyber threats in the healthcare sector. Vulnerabilities in the existing and legacy systems are one of the key causes for the threats and related risks. Understanding and addressing the threats from the connected medical devices and other parts of the ICT health infrastructure are of paramount importance for ensuring security within the overall healthcare ecosystem. Threat and vulnerability analysis provides an effective way to lower the impact of risks relating to the existing vulnerabilities. However, this is a challenging task due to the availability of massive data which makes it difficult to identify potential patterns of security issues. This paper contributes towards an effective threats and vulnerabilities analysis by adopting Machine Learning models, such as the BERT neural language model and XGBoost, to extract updated information from the Natural Language documents largely available on the web, evaluating at the same time the level of the identified threats and vulnerabilities that can impact on the healthcare system, providing the required information for the most appropriate management of the risk. Experiments were performed based on CS news extracted from the Hacker News website and on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability reports. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which provides a realistic manner to assess the threats and vulnerabilities from Natural Language texts, allowing adopting it in real-world Healthcare ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) has been a remarkable focal point in recent years, since it is recognized as a potential method to reduce traffic congestion, emission and accident. However, the connectivity function makes CAVs vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An intuitive method to defend cyber-attacks on CAVs is that if the error between expected and measured behaviors exceeds a predetermined threshold, a security scheme should be activated. This study investigates another type of cyber-attack, denoted as slight attacks, in which the communicated data of CAVs are randomly deviated from the actual ones and deviations do not exceed the threshold. The primary objective is to evaluate the influence of slight cyber-attacks on longitudinal safety of CAVs. An empirical CAV model is first utilized to describe vehicle dynamics and generate trajectory data. A rear-end collision risk index (RCRI) derived from safe stopping distance is used to establish relation between longitudinal safety and trajectory data. Two attacked factors, communicated positions and speeds from preceding vehicles are tested. Extensive simulations are conducted and parameters are also tested via sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that (1) when one CAV is under slight cyber-attacks, it is more dangerous if communicated positions are attacked than speeds; (2) when multi CAVs are under attacked, it is possible that a situation with more vehicles under attack at a low severity may be more dangerous than that with fewer vehicles but under attack at a high severity; (3) the impact of slight cyber-attacks on deceleration period is more serious compared to acceleration period. The findings of this study provide useful suggestion for defending cyber-attacks on CAVs and improving longitudinal safety in the future.",

    "title": "Secure Vehicular Platoon Management against Sybil Attacks.",
    "abstract": "The capacity of highways has been an ever-present constraint in the 21st century, bringing about the issue of safety with greater likelihoods of traffic accidents occurring. Furthermore, recent global oil prices have inflated to record levels. A potential solution lies in vehicular platooning, which has been garnering attention, but its deployment is uncommon due to cyber security concerns. One particular concern is a Sybil attack, by which the admission of fake virtual vehicles into the platoon allows malicious actors to wreak havoc on the platoon itself. In this paper, we propose a secure management scheme for platoons that can protect major events that occur in the platoon operations against Sybil attacks. Both vehicle identity and message exchanged are authenticated by adopting key exchange, digital signature and encryption schemes based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Noteworthy features of the scheme include providing perfect forward secrecy and both group forward and backward secrecy to preserve the privacy of vehicles and platoons. Typical malicious attacks such as replay and man-in-the-middle attacks for example can also be resisted. A formal evaluation of the security functionality of the scheme by the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary and the random oracle model as well as a brief computational verification by CryptoVerif were conducted. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated to show its time and space efficiency.",

    "title": "Smart Home Privacy Protection Methods against a Passive Wireless Snooping Side-Channel Attack.",
    "abstract": "Smart home technologies have attracted more users in recent years due to significant advancements in their underlying enabler components, such as sensors, actuators, and processors, which are spreading in various domains and have become more affordable. However, these IoT-based solutions are prone to data leakage; this privacy issue has motivated researchers to seek a secure solution to overcome this challenge. In this regard, wireless signal eavesdropping is one of the most severe threats that enables attackers to obtain residents' sensitive information. Even if the system encrypts all communications, some cyber attacks can still steal information by interpreting the contextual data related to the transmitted signals. For example, a \"fingerprint and timing-based snooping (FATS)\" attack is a side-channel attack (SCA) developed to infer in-home activities passively from a remote location near the targeted house. An SCA is a sort of cyber attack that extracts valuable information from smart systems without accessing the content of data packets. This paper reviews the SCAs associated with cyber-physical systems, focusing on the proposed solutions to protect the privacy of smart homes against FATS attacks in detail. Moreover, this work clarifies shortcomings and future opportunities by analyzing the existing gaps in the reviewed methods.",

    "title": "Strengthening Privacy and Data Security in Biomedical Microelectromechanical Systems by IoT Communication Security and Protection in Smart Healthcare.",
    "abstract": "Biomedical Microelectromechanical Systems (BioMEMS) serve as a crucial catalyst in enhancing IoT communication security and safeguarding smart healthcare systems. Situated at the nexus of advanced technology and healthcare, BioMEMS are instrumental in pioneering personalized diagnostics, monitoring, and therapeutic applications. Nonetheless, this integration brings forth a complex array of security and privacy challenges intrinsic to IoT communications within smart healthcare ecosystems, demanding comprehensive scrutiny. In this manuscript, we embark on an extensive analysis of the intricate security terrain associated with IoT communications in the realm of BioMEMS, addressing a spectrum of vulnerabilities that spans cyber threats, data manipulation, and interception of communications. The integration of real-world case studies serves to illuminate the direct repercussions of security breaches within smart healthcare systems, highlighting the imperative to safeguard both patient safety and the integrity of medical data. We delve into a suite of security solutions, encompassing rigorous authentication processes, data encryption, designs resistant to attacks, and continuous monitoring mechanisms, all tailored to fortify BioMEMS in the face of ever-evolving threats within smart healthcare environments. Furthermore, the paper underscores the vital role of ethical and regulatory considerations, emphasizing the need to uphold patient autonomy, ensure the confidentiality of data, and maintain equitable access to healthcare in the context of IoT communication security. Looking forward, we explore the impending landscape of BioMEMS security as it intertwines with emerging technologies such as AI-driven diagnostics, quantum computing, and genomic integration, anticipating potential challenges and strategizing for the future. In doing so, this paper highlights the paramount importance of adopting an integrated approach that seamlessly blends technological innovation, ethical foresight, and collaborative ingenuity, thereby steering BioMEMS towards a secure and resilient future within smart healthcare systems, in the ambit of IoT communication security and protection.",

    "abstract": "Medical devices increasingly depend on computing functions such as wireless communication and Internet connectivity for software-based control of therapies and network-based transmission of patients' stored medical information. These computing capabilities introduce security and privacy risks, yet little is known about the prevalence of such risks within the clinical setting. We used three comprehensive, publicly available databases maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate recalls and adverse events related to security and privacy risks of medical devices. Review of weekly enforcement reports identified 1,845 recalls; 605 (32.8%) of these included computers, 35 (1.9%) stored patient data, and 31 (1.7%) were capable of wireless communication. Searches of databases specific to recalls and adverse events identified only one event with a specific connection to security or privacy. Software-related recalls were relatively common, and most (81.8%) mentioned the possibility of upgrades, though only half of these provided specific instructions for the update mechanism. Our review of recalls and adverse events from federal government databases reveals sharp inconsistencies with databases at individual providers with respect to security and privacy risks. Recalls related to software may increase security risks because of unprotected update and correction mechanisms. To detect signals of security and privacy problems that adversely affect public health, federal postmarket surveillance strategies should rethink how to effectively and efficiently collect data on security and privacy problems in devices that increasingly depend on computing systems susceptible to malware.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, clinical care has become globally dependent on information technology. The cybersecurity of health care information systems is now an essential component of safe, reliable, and effective health care delivery. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of the literature at the intersection of cybersecurity and health care delivery. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science for English-language peer-reviewed articles. We carried out chronological analysis, domain clustering analysis, and text analysis of the included articles to generate a high-level concept map composed of specific words and the connections between them. Our final sample included 472 English-language journal articles. Our review results revealed that majority of the articles were focused on technology: Technology-focused articles made up more than half of all the clusters, whereas managerial articles accounted for only 32% of all clusters. This finding suggests that nontechnological variables (human-based and organizational aspects, strategy, and management) may be understudied. In addition, Software Development Security, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery Planning each accounted for 3% of the studied articles. Our results also showed that publications on Physical Security account for only 1% of the literature, and research in this area is lacking. Cyber vulnerabilities are not all digital; many physical threats contribute to breaches and potentially affect the physical safety of patients. Our results revealed an overall increase in research on cybersecurity and identified major gaps and opportunities for future work.",

    "abstract": "As complex systems composed of physical and cyber components, mechanically pumped loop systems (MPLs) are vulnerable to both passive threats (e.g., physical failures) and active threats such as cyber-attacks launched on the network control systems. The impact of the aforementioned two threats on MPL operations is yet unknown, and there is no practical way to evaluate their severity. To assess the severity of the impact of physical failures and cyber-attacks on MPLs, a safety impact analysis framework based on Elman Neural Network (ENN) observers and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm is suggested. The framework discusses three common attack and failure modes: sensor hard failure that occurs suddenly, sensor soft failure that occurs gradually over time, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that prevent communication between the controller and valve. Both sensor failures and DoS attacks render the system unsafe, according to simulation data. In comparison to DoS attacks, however, sensor failures, particularly soft failures, inflict the greatest harm to the MPLs. Furthermore, sensors engaged in global control, rather than those involved in local control, need additional protection.",

    "abstract": "To improve the cybersecurity of Cloud Computing (CC) system. This paper proposes a Network Anomaly Detection (NAD) model based on the Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Secondly, the Cybersecurity Assessment Model (CAM) based on Grey Relational Grade (GRG) is creatively constructed. Finally, combined with Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm, this work proposes a CC network-oriented data encryption technology, selects different data sets for different models, and tests each model through design experiments. The results show that the average Correct Detection Rate (CDR) of the NAD model for different types of abnormal data is 93.33%. The average False Positive Rate (FPR) and the average Unreported Rate (UR) are 6.65% and 16.27%, respectively. Thus, the NAD model can ensure a high detection accuracy in the case of sufficient data. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity situation prediction by the CAM is in good agreement with the actual situation. The error between the average value of cybersecurity situation prediction and the actual value is only 0.82%, and the prediction accuracy is high. The RSA algorithm can control the average encryption time for very large text, about 12s. The decryption time is slightly longer but within a reasonable range. For different-size text, the encryption time is maintained within 0.5s. This work aims to provide important technical support for anomaly detection, overall security situation analysis, and data transmission security protection of CC systems to improve their cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "While a natural disaster or related threat may impact an organisation at some point, it is more likely (even inevitable) that it will be the victim of a cyber attack. The solution to being better prepared for these imminent attacks is to undertake more lightweight and frequent incident response (IR) exercises to help build capabilities and community through a tighter, recurring cycle of planning, conducting and assessing. To boost the facilitation of IR exercises, organisations must leverage the established relationships between business continuity management (BCM) or resilience staff (both of which are familiar with business continuity and disaster recovery exercises), and their information security office. As BCM will ultimately be involved in response and recovery after a cyber attack, it is intuitively more effective to collaborate with BCM in advance. Indeed, it has been substantiated that BCM engagement improves incident response time and reduces incident response costs. This paper concludes that involving BCM or resilience departments in IR exercises contributes to more effective responses to actual incidents.",

To address this scenario, the present paper conducts a study on the security factors integral to the healthcare information system and conducts the performance analysis of these factors. For this intent, the study has employed the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F.AHP) integrated with Technique Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) integrated framework for evaluating the performance of each factor. Thereafter, the factors that play a vital role in healthcare data security breaches have been prioritized as per their security weights. Furthermore, the validity of the results obtained by the stated methodology has been established by conducting the sensitivity analysis and comparison of results with the other methods by using the same data set. Based on results thus obtained, the access control and software security have been identified as the most promising security factors.",

    "abstract": "The \"Internet-of-Medical-Vehicles (IOMV)\" is one of the special applications of the Internet of Things resulting from combining connected healthcare and connected vehicles. As the IOMV communicates with a variety of networks along its travel path, it incurs various security risks due to sophisticated cyber-attacks. This can endanger the onboard patient's life. So, it is critical to understand subjects related to \"cybersecurity\" in the IOMV to develop robust cybersecurity measures. In this paper, the goal is to evaluate recent trends and state-of-the-art publications, gaps, and future outlooks related to this research area. With this aim, a variety of publications between 2016 and 2023 from \"Web-of-Science\" and \"Scopus\" databases were analysed. Our analysis revealed that the IOMV is a niche and unexplored research area with few defined standards and frameworks, and there is a great need to implement robust cybersecurity measures. This paper will help researchers to gain a comprehensive idea of this niche research topic, as it presents an analysis of top journals and highly cited papers, their challenges and limitations, the system model and architecture of the IOMV, related applicable standards, potential cyber-attacks, factors causing cybersecurity risks, various artificial intelligence techniques for developing potential countermeasures, the assessment and parameterisation of cybersecurity risks, constraints and challenges, and future outlooks for implementing cybersecurity measures in the IOMV.",

    "title": "Framework for cyber risk loss distribution of hospital infrastructure: Bond percolation on mixed random graphs approach.",
    "abstract": "Networks like those of healthcare infrastructure have been a primary target of cyberattacks for over a decade. From just a single cyberattack, a healthcare facility would expect to see millions of dollars in losses from legal fines, business interruption, and loss of revenue. As more medical devices become interconnected, more cyber vulnerabilities emerge, resulting in more potential exploitation that may disrupt patient care and give rise to catastrophic financial losses. In this paper, we propose a structural model of an aggregate loss distribution across multiple cyberattacks on a prototypical hospital network. Modeled as a mixed random graph, the hospital network consists of various patient-monitoring devices and medical imaging equipment as random nodes to account for the variable occupancy of patient rooms and availability of imaging equipment that are connected by bidirectional edges to fixed hospital and radiological information systems. Our framework accounts for the documented cyber vulnerabilities of a hospital's trusted internal network of its major medical assets. To our knowledge, there exist no other models of an aggregate loss distribution for cyber risk in this setting. We contextualize the problem in the probabilistic graph-theoretical framework using a percolation model and combinatorial techniques to compute the mean and variance of the loss distribution for a mixed random network with associated random costs that can be useful for healthcare administrators and cybersecurity professionals to improve cybersecurity management strategies. By characterizing this distribution, we allow for the further utility of pricing cyber risk.",

    "title": "Improving Student Engagement in the Study of Professional Ethics: Concepts and an Example in Cyber Security.",
    "abstract": "In spite of the acknowledged importance of professional ethics, technical students often show little enthusiasm for studying the subject. This paper considers how such engagement might be improved. Four guiding principles for promoting engagement are identified: (1) aligning teaching content with student interests; (2) taking a pragmatic rather than a philosophical approach to issue resolution; (3) addressing the full complexity of real-world case studies; and (4) covering content in a way that students find entertaining. The use of these principles is then discussed with respect to the specific experience of developing and presenting a master's module in Ethical and Legal Issues in Cyber Security at Queens University Belfast. One significant aspect of the resulting design is that it encourages students to see ethical issues in systemic terms rather than from an individual perspective, with issues emerging from a conflict between different groups with different vested interests. Case studies are used to examine how personal and business priorities create conflicts that can lead to negative press, fines and punitive legal action. The module explores the reasons why organisations may be unaware of the risks associated with their actions and how an inappropriate response to an ethical issue can significantly aggravate a situation. The module has been delivered in three successive years since 2014 and been well received on each occasion. The paper describes the design of the module and the experience of delivering it, concluding with a discussion of the effectiveness of the approach.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a significant rise in research on high-consequence human and animal pathogens, many now known as \"select agents.\" While physical security around these agents is tightly regulated, information security standards are still lagging. The understanding of the threats unique to the academic and research environment is still evolving, in part due to poor communication between the various stakeholders. Perhaps as a result, information security guidelines published by select agent regulators lack the critical details and directives needed to achieve even the lowest security level of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). While only government agencies are currently required to abide by the provisions of FISMA (unless specified as preconditions for obtaining government grants or contracts--still a relatively rare or narrowly scoped occurrence), the same strategies were recently recommended by executive order for others. We propose that information security guidelines for select agent research be updated to promulgate and detail FISMA standards and processes and that the latter be ultimately incorporated into select agent regulations. We also suggest that information security in academic and research institutions would greatly benefit from active efforts to improve communication among the biosecurity, security, and information technology communities, and from a secure venue for exchange of timely information on emerging threats and solutions in the research environment.",

Numerous significant effects were obtained and a fairly clear rank ordering of performance for the four graphical displays was obtained across experiments (from best to worst): Bar Graph, Cube, Radial Traffic Analyser, and Treemap. The results are interpreted from the perspective of ecological interface design: the quality of performance is directly related to the quality of semantic mapping between work domain, display, and human constraints. Factors that may have contributed to the poor performance for the Radial Traffic Analyser and Treemap displays are discussed. General implications for display and interface design are provided.

    "title": "Design of a Secure Medical Data Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain.",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data, Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) are increasingly demanding data security, while cloud storage solves the storage problem of complex medical data. However, it is difficult to realize data security sharing. The decentralization feature of blockchain is helpful to solve the problem that the secure authentication process is highly dependent on the trusted third party and implement data security transmission. In this paper, the blockchain technology is used to describe the security requirements in authentication process, and a network model of MCPS based on blockchain is proposed. Through analysis of medical data storage architecture, it can ensure that data can't be tampered and untrackable. In the security authentication phase, bilinear mapping and intractable problems can be used to solve the security threat in the authentication process of medical data providers and users. It can avoid the credibility problem of the trusted third party, and also can realize the ?thyc=10?>two-way authentication between the hospital and blockchain node. Then, BAN logic is used to analyze security protocols, and formal analysis and comparison of security protocols are also made. The results show that the MCPS based on blockchain not only realizes medical treatment data sharing, but also meet the various security requirements in the security authentication phase. In addition, the storage and computing overhead costs is ideal. Therefore, the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure sharing of medical big data.",

    "abstract": "Medical device-integrated electronic medical records (MDI-EMR) pose significant challenges in ensuring effective usage, data security and patient safety. The complexities of MDI-EMR necessitate applying various security mechanisms to safeguard against cyber threats. Therefore, we evaluated cyber threats to MDI-EMR and the effectiveness of applied security controls using a proposed framework from sociotechnical and risk assessment perspectives. We conducted a qualitative case study evaluation in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia using interviews, observation, and document analysis from the perspectives of major MDI-EMR stakeholders, including healthcare providers, IT professionals and cybersecurity specialists. The results showed the interplay among physical, technical and administrative security controls that maintained a secure posture of MDI-EMR. The effectiveness of security controls is highly influenced by the staff's cybersecurity awareness and training. The perceived effectiveness of security controls varied among users, with some expressing satisfaction with the ease of use and reliability, while others highlighting challenges such as password complexity and access procedures. Understanding these diverse perspectives is crucial for tailoring security measures to meet the needs of different stakeholders effectively. Collaboration among the key stakeholders is crucial for implementing security controls for MDI-EMR. Balancing security measures with usability concerns is essential, as highlighted by challenges in implementing technical controls. A comprehensive approach encompassing physical, technical and administrative controls, continuous education and awareness initiatives are significant to empower staff in recognising and mitigating cyber threats effectively to safeguard medical data and ensure the integrity of healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and interoperable technologies have transformed how patient data affect medical care; such technological innovations revolutionize how healthcare organizations (HCOs) improve cost, quality, and access. New cyber risks, however, accompany developing cyber ecosystems. Although immediate data exchange is beneficial, risk arises from the IoMT's increased susceptibility to human influence. The success of quality care relies on protecting health information technology (HIT) against newly developing cyber vulnerabilities. Therefore, managers must be just as invested in their HCO's cybersecurity protocols as cybercriminals are in bypassing those protocols. This essay proposes a healthcare cyber resiliency model that leverages human and technical factors through a cycle of feedback and process improvement. It intends to equip healthcare administrators with the foundational philosophy necessary to secure their emerging technologies.",

Evolving technology enables wireless healthcare systems to communicate over longer ranges, which opens them up to greater numbers of possible threats. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones present a new and evolving attack surface for compromising wireless healthcare systems. An enumeration of the types of wireless attacks capable via drones are presented, including two new types of cyber threats: a stepping stone attack and a cloud-enabled attack. A real UAV is developed to test and demonstrate the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems to this new threat vector. The UAV successfully attacked a simulated smart hospital environment and also a small collection of wearable healthcare sensors. Compromise of wearable or implanted medical devices can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.",

As such, the solution proposed in this paper is envisioned to deal with the whole supply chain system components, from the IoT ecosystem to the infrastructure connecting them, addressing security and privacy functionalities related to risks and vulnerabilities management, accountability, and mitigation strategies, as well as security metrics and evidence-based security assurance. In this paper, we present FISHY as a preliminary architecture that is designed to orchestrate existing and beyond state-of-the-art security appliances in composed ICT scenarios. To this end, the FISHY architecture leverages the capabilities of programmable networks and IT infrastructure through seamless orchestration and instantiation of novel security services, both in real-time and proactively. The paper also includes a thorough business analysis to go far beyond the technical benefits of a potential FISHY adoption, as well as three real-world use cases highlighting the envisioned benefits of a potential FISHY adoption.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to discover the impact of software security and e-mail security on overall cybersecurity among the students of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University in Dammam. Another main purpose to conduct this study is to know the level of knowledge students have in the developing countries about the cybersecurity and how much are they mindful of cyber-attacks and the level of awareness among the university students. Two important hypotheses were studied to discover their importance in awareness of cybersecurity. One is software security, and the other is e-mail security. A total of 11 relevant questions were drafted, and then these questions were distributed among the university students, and around 390 responded to the questionnaires. Statistical analysis was performed on the responses using tools. Initial tests such as validity and reliability test, feasibility test of a variable, correlation test, multicollinearity test, multiple regression, and Heteroskedasticity test were conducted using SPSS. And furthermore, multiple linear regression model and coefficient of determination, hypothesis test, ANOVA test, and partial test were conducted using ANOVA. The outcome of the analysis is software security variable (X1) that has a significant and positive effect on cybersecurity awareness ( value ≤0.001, = 0.192). This shows that having a thorough understanding of software security can raise cybersecurity awareness up to 19.2%. E-mail security variable (X2) has a significant and positive effect on cybersecurityawareness ( -value ≤0.000). This shows that having a thorough understanding of email security can raise cybersecurity awareness up to 31.3%. Software security ( 1) and e-mail security ( 2) variables simultaneously have a significant effect on cybersecurity awareness ( -value ≤0.000) with a correlation coefficient of 12.1% ( 2 = 0.121). This shows that the independent variable used can explain the level of cybersecurity awareness up to 12.1%. Research results show that students are aware of software or application updates. Furthermore, students' awareness of email security is also good.",

    "abstract": "Web applications have become ubiquitous for many business sectors due to their platform independence and low operation cost. Billions of users are visiting these applications to accomplish their daily tasks. However, many of these applications are either vulnerable to web defacement attacks or created and managed by hackers such as fraudulent and phishing websites. Detecting malicious websites is essential to prevent the spreading of malware and protect end-users from being victims. However, most existing solutions rely on extracting features from the website's content which can be harmful to the detection machines themselves and subject to obfuscations. Detecting malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) is safer and more efficient than content analysis. However, the detection of malicious URLs is still not well addressed due to insufficient features and inaccurate classification. This study aims at improving the detection accuracy of malicious URL detection by designing and developing a cyber threat intelligence-based malicious URL detection model using two-stage ensemble learning. The cyber threat intelligence-based features are extracted from web searches to improve detection accuracy. Cybersecurity analysts and users reports around the globe can provide important information regarding malicious websites. Therefore, cyber threat intelligence-based (CTI) features extracted from Google searches and Whois websites are used to improve detection performance. The study also proposed a two-stage ensemble learning model that combines the random forest (RF) algorithm for preclassification with multilayer perceptron (MLP) for final decision making. The trained MLP classifier has replaced the majority voting scheme of the three trained random forest classifiers for decision making. The probabilistic output of the weak classifiers of the random forest was aggregated and used as input for the MLP classifier for adequate classification. Results show that the extracted CTI-based features with the two-stage classification outperform other studies' detection models. The proposed CTI-based detection model achieved a 7.8% accuracy improvement and 6.7% reduction in false-positive rates compared with the traditional URL-based model.",

    "abstract": "Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are widely used today for user authentication on mobile devices. However, this authentication method can be subject to several attacks such as phishing, smudge, and side-channel. In this paper, we increase the security of PIN-based authentication by considering behavioral biometrics, specifically the smartphone movements typical of each user. To this end, we propose a method based on anomaly detection that is capable of recognizing whether the PIN is inserted by the smartphone owner or by an attacker. This decision is taken according to the smartphone movements, which are recorded during the PIN insertion through the built-in motion sensors. For each digit in the PIN, an anomaly score is computed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Subsequently, these scores are combined to obtain the final decision metric. Numerical results show that our authentication method can achieve an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 5% in the case of 4-digit PINs, and 4% in the case of 6-digit PINs. Considering a reduced training set, composed of solely 50 samples, the EER only slightly worsens, reaching 6%. The practicality of our approach is further confirmed by the low processing time required, on the order of fractions of milliseconds.",

This provides organisations with a complex dilemma: how to share information as openly as possibly about cyber incidents, while protecting their confidentiality and focusing on service recovery from such incidents.

The ability to effectively address these threats relies on a comprehensive threat analysis and risk assessment and the creation of relevant asset and threat taxonomies for the new culture. In response to this need, we built the required taxonomies and performed a thorough analysis of the threats associated with this new work culture. In this paper, we present our taxonomies and the results of our analysis. We also examine the impact of each threat, indicate when it is expected to occur, describe the various prevention methods available commercially or proposed in academic research, and present specific use cases.",

    "title": "Detecting and Localizing Cyber-Physical Attacks in Water Distribution Systems without Records of Labeled Attacks.",
    "abstract": "Modern water distribution systems (WDSs) offer automated controls and operations to improve their efficiency and reliability. Nonetheless, such automation can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, various approaches have been suggested to detect cyber-attacks in WDSs. However, most of these approaches rely on labeled attack records which are rarely available in real-world applications. Thus, for a detection model to be practical, it should be able to detect and localize events without referring to a predetermined list of labeled attacks. This study proposes a semi-supervised approach that relies solely on attack-free datasets to address this challenge. The approach utilizes a reduction in dimensionality by using maximum canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) followed by support vector data description (SVDD). The developed algorithm was tested on two case studies and various datasets, demonstrating consistently high performance in detecting and localizing cyber-attacks.",

    "title": "A Cyber Risk Assessment Approach to Federated Identity Management Framework-Based Digital Healthcare System.",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive and evidence-based cyber-risk assessment approach specifically designed for Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS)- and Internet-of-Medical Devices (IoMT)-based collaborative digital healthcare systems, which leverage Federated Identity Management (FIM) solutions to manage user identities within this complex environment. While these systems offer advantages like easy data collection and improved collaboration, they also introduce new security challenges due to the interconnected nature of devices and data, as well as vulnerabilities within the FIM and the lack of robust security in IoMT devices. To proactively safeguard the digital healthcare system from cyber attacks with potentially life-threatening consequences, a comprehensive and evidence-based cyber-risk assessment is crucial for mitigating these risks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel cyber-risk assessment approach that leverages a three-dimensional attack landscape analysis, encompassing existing IT infrastructure, medical devices, and Federated Identity Management protocols. By considering their interconnected vulnerabilities, the approach recommends tailored security controls to prioritize and mitigate critical risks, ultimately enhancing system resilience. The proposed approach combines established industry standards like Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) asset management and NIST SP 800-30 for a comprehensive assessment. We have validated our approach using threat modeling with attack trees and detailed attack sequence diagrams on a diverse range of IoMT and MCPS devices from various vendors. The resulting evidence-based cyber-risk assessments and corresponding security control recommendations will significantly support healthcare professionals and providers in improving both patient and medical device safety management within the FIM-enabled healthcare ecosystem.",

This paper is motivated by the most recent incidents happened worldwide and have resulted in the compromise of diagnosis results. This study was undertaken to show how the IMDS could be attacked and diagnosis results compromised and present a set of cyber defense strategies to prevent against such attacks. This study used the ECGs data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2017. We fed the data into our IMDS and launched a series of ethical hacking, which is specifically tailored to target IMDS. We proposed a set of cyber security strategies to prevent such compromise. We tested the effectiveness of our cyber defense strategies using an experiment. The results showed that the strategies were effective in protecting the IMDS diagnosis results from being compromised. This study provides novel insights into the protection of IMDS and concludes that our cyber defense strategies can protect IMDS from being compromised by Brute Force and SQL Injection attacks.",

Regression analyses revealed that the hacking/IT incident breach type and network server breach location were the most significant predictors of the number of individuals affected; however, they were not predictive when combined. Moreover, network server location and unauthorized access/disclosure breach type were predictive when combined. Additional analyses of variance revealed that covered entity type and business associate presence were significant predictors, while the geographic region of a breach occurrence was insignificant. The results of this study revealed several associations between healthcare breach characteristics and the number of individuals affected, suggesting that more individuals are affected in hacking/IT incidents and network server breaches independently and that network server breach location and unauthorized access/disclosure breach type were predictive in combination.",

    "title": "CANon: Lightweight and Practical Cyber-Attack Detection for Automotive Controller Area Networks.",
    "abstract": "Automotive cyber-physical systems are in transition from the closed-systems to open-networking systems. As a result, in-vehicle networks such as the controller area network (CAN) have become essential to connect to inter-vehicle networks through the various rich interfaces. Newly exposed security concerns derived from this requirement may cause in-vehicle networks to pose threats to automotive security and driver's safety. In this paper, to ensure a high level of security of the in-vehicle network for automotive CPS, we propose a novel lightweight and practical cyber defense platform, referred to as CANon (CAN with origin authentication and non-repudiation), to be enabled to detect cyber-attacks in real-time. CANon is designed based on the hierarchical approach of centralized-session management and distributed-origin authentication. In the former, a gateway node manages each initialization vector and session of origin-centric groups consisting of two more sending and receiving nodes. In the latter, the receiving nodes belonging to the given origin-centric group individually perform the symmetric key-based detection against cyber-attacks by verifying each message received from the sending node, namely origin authentication, in real-time. To improve the control security, CANon employs a one-time local key selected from a sequential hash chain (SHC) for authentication of an origin node in a distributed mode and exploits the iterative hash operations with randomness. Since the SHC can constantly generate and consume hash values regardless of their memory capacities, it is very effective for resource-limited nodes for in-vehicle networks. In addition, through implicit key synchronization within a given group, CANon addresses the challenges of a key exposure problem and a complex key distribution mechanism when performing symmetric key-based authentication. To achieve lightweight cyber-attack detection without imposing an additive load on CAN, CANon uses a keyed-message authentication code (KMAC) activated within a given group. The detection performance of CANon is evaluated under an actual node of Freescale S12XF and virtual nodes operating on the well-known CANoe tool. It is seen that the detection rate of CANon against brute-force and replay attacks reaches 100% when the length of KMAC is over 16 bits. It demonstrates that CANon ensures high security and is sufficient to operate in real-time even on low-performance ECUs. Moreover, CANon based on several software modules operates without an additive hardware security module at an upper layer of the CAN protocol and can be directly ported to CAN-FD (CAN with Flexible Data rate) so that it achieves the practical cyber defense platform.",

    "abstract": "The use of anti-forensic techniques is a very common practice that stealthy adversaries may deploy to minimise their traces and make the investigation of an incident harder by evading detection and attribution. In this paper, we study the interaction between a cyber forensic Investigator and a strategic Attacker using a game-theoretic framework. This is based on a Bayesian game of incomplete information played on a multi-host cyber forensics investigation graph of actions traversed by both players. The edges of the graph represent players' actions across different hosts in a network. In alignment with the concept of Bayesian games, we define two Attacker types to represent their ability of deploying anti-forensic techniques to conceal their activities. In this way, our model allows the Investigator to identify the optimal investigating policy taking into consideration the cost and impact of the available actions, while coping with the uncertainty of the Attacker's type and strategic decisions. To evaluate our model, we construct a realistic case study based on threat reports and data extracted from the MITRE ATT&CK STIX repository, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and interviews with cyber-security practitioners. We use the case study to compare the performance of the proposed method against two other investigative methods and three different types of Attackers.",

Due to the enhanced interconnectedness of IoMT devices, their susceptibility to cyber-attacks has proportionally escalated. Motivated by the promising potential of AI-related technologies to improve certain cybersecurity measures, we present a comprehensive review of this emerging field. In this review, we attempt to bridge the corresponding literature gap regarding modern cybersecurity technologies that deploy AI techniques to improve their performance and compensate for security and privacy vulnerabilities. In this direction, we have systematically gathered and classified the extensive research on this topic. Our findings highlight the fact that the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques improves both the performance of cybersecurity measures and their speed, reliability, and effectiveness. This may be proven to be useful for improving the security and privacy of IoMT devices. Furthermore, by considering the numerous advantages of AI technologies as opposed to their core cybersecurity counterparts, including blockchain, anomaly detection, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, federated learning, and so on, we provide a structured overview of the current scientific trends. We conclude with considerations for future research, emphasizing the promising potential of AI-driven cybersecurity in the IoMT landscape, especially in patient data protection and in data-driven healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are computer-based control architectures specifically engineered for the operation of industrial machinery via hardware and software models. These systems are used to project, monitor, and automate the state of the operational network through the utilization of ethernet links, which enable two-way communications. However, as a result of their constant connectivity to the internet and the lack of security frameworks within their internal architecture, they are susceptible to cyber-attacks. In light of this, we have proposed an intrusion detection algorithm, intending to alleviate this security bottleneck. The proposed algorithm, the Genetically Seeded Flora (GSF) feature optimization algorithm, is integrated with Transformer Neural Network (TNN) and functions by detecting changes in operational patterns that may be indicative of an intruder's involvement. The proposed Genetically Seeded Flora Transformer Neural Network (GSFTNN) algorithm stands in stark contrast to the signature-based method employed by traditional intrusion detection systems. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted using the WUSTL-IIOT-2018 ICS SCADA cyber security dataset. The results of these experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms such as Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

Initially, organisations made great inroads in preventing and containing cyber attacks. In the last few years, however, cyber criminals have become adept at eluding defence security technologies and rapidly modifying their exploit strategies for financial or political gains. Similar to changes in military combat tactics, cyber criminals utilise distributed attack cells, real-time communications, and rapidly mutating exploits to minimise the potential for detection. Cyber criminals have changed their attack paradigm.

    "abstract": "Today, personal medical devices (PMDs) play an increasingly important role in healthcare ecosystems as patient life support equipment. As a result of technological advances, PMDs now encompass many components and functionalities that open the door to a variety of cyber-attacks. In this paper we present a taxonomy of ten widely-used PMDs based on the five diseases they were designed to treat. We also provide a comprehensive survey that covers 17 possible attacks aimed at PMDs, as well as the attacks' building blocks. For each PMD type, we create an ecosystem and data and attack flow diagram, which comprehensively describes the roles and interactions of the players associated with the PMD and presents the most vulnerable vectors and components within the PMDs' ecosystems; such knowledge can increase security awareness among PMD users and their healthcare providers. We also present the basic, yet important, building blocks that constitute the steps by which each of the attacks presented is carried out. Doing so allowed us to establish the foundations for the future development of a novel risk analysis methodology for medical devices. For each attack we mapped the building blocks required to carry out the attack and found that 50% of the attacks rely upon the ability to remotely connect to the PMD, while 61% of them rely on the physical proximity of the attacker to the PMD. Finally, by surveying 21 existing security mechanisms and mapping their coverage for the attacks, we identify the gaps between PMDs' security mechanisms and the possible attacks. We show that current security mechanisms generally fail to provide protection from all of the attacks against PMDs and suggest the development of a comprehensive framework to secure PMDs and protect the patients that rely upon them.",

    "abstract": "Hospitals use medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) more often to give patients quality continuous care. MCPS isa life-critical, context-aware, networked system of medical equipment. It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture-data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action-are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.",

    "title": "Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT): A Comprehensive Review from Architecture to Security and Privacy Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Throughout the course of human history, owing to innovations that shape the future of mankind, many technologies have been innovated and used towards making people's lives easier. Such technologies have made us who we are today and are involved with every domain that is vital for human survival such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one such technology that revolutionizes almost every aspect of our lives, found early in the 21st century with the advancement of Internet and Information Communication (ICT) Technologies. As of now, the IoT is served in almost every domain, as we mentioned above, allowing the connectivity of digital objects around us to the Internet, thus allowing the remote monitoring, control, and execution of actions based on underlying conditions, making such objects smarter. Over time, the IoT has progressively evolved and paved the way towards the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) which is the use of nano-size miniature IoT devices. The IoNT is a relatively new technology that has lately begun to establish a name for itself, and many are not aware of it, even in academia or research. The use of the IoT always comes at a cost, owing to the connectivity to the Internet and the inherently vulnerable nature of IoT, wherein it paves the way for hackers to compromise security and privacy. This is also applicable to the IoNT, which is the advanced and miniature version of IoT, and brings disastrous consequences if such security and privacy violations were to occur as no one can notice such issues pertaining to the IoNT, due to their miniaturized nature and novelty in the field. The lack of research in the IoNT domain has motivated us to synthesize this research, highlighting architectural elements in the IoNT ecosystem and security and privacy challenges pertaining to the IoNT. In this regard, in the study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the IoNT ecosystem and security and privacy pertaining to the IoNT as a reference to future research.",

    "abstract": "The Medical Internet-of-Things (MIoT) has developed revolutionary ways of delivering medical care to patients. An example system, showing increasing demand, is the artificial pancreas system that offers convenience and reliable support care to patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Despite the apparent benefits, the system cannot escape potential cyber threats that may worsen a patient's condition. The security risks need immediate attention to ensure the privacy of the patient and preserve safe functionality. Motivated by this, we proposed a security protocol for the APS environment wherein support to essential security requirements is guaranteed, the security context negotiation is resource-friendly, and the protocol is resilient to emergencies. Accordingly, the security requirements and correctness of the design protocol were formally verified using BAN logic and AVISPA, and proved its feasibility through the emulation of APS in a controlled environment using commercial off-the-shelf devices. Moreover, the results of our performance analysis indicate that the proposed protocol is more efficient than the other existing works and standards.",

    "title": "Towards a Cognitive Theory of Cyber Deception.",
    "abstract": "This work is an initial step toward developing a cognitive theory of cyber deception. While widely studied, the psychology of deception has largely focused on physical cues of deception. Given that present-day communication among humans is largely electronic, we focus on the cyber domain where physical cues are unavailable and for which there is less psychological research. To improve cyber defense, researchers have used signaling theory to extended algorithms developed for the optimal allocation of limited defense resources by using deceptive signals to trick the human mind. However, the algorithms are designed to protect against adversaries that make perfectly rational decisions. In behavioral experiments using an abstract cybersecurity game (i.e., Insider Attack Game), we examined human decision-making when paired against the defense algorithm. We developed an instance-based learning (IBL) model of an attacker using the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture to investigate how humans make decisions under deception in cyber-attack scenarios. Our results show that the defense algorithm is more effective at reducing the probability of attack and protecting assets when using deceptive signaling, compared to no signaling, but is less effective than predicted against a perfectly rational adversary. Also, the IBL model replicates human attack decisions accurately. The IBL model shows how human decisions arise from experience, and how memory retrieval dynamics can give rise to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias. The implications of these findings are discussed in the perspective of informing theories of deception and designing more effective signaling schemes that consider human bounded rationality.",

    "title": "Optical Systems Identification through Rayleigh Backscattering.",
    "abstract": "We introduce a technique to generate and read the digital signature of the networks, channels, and optical devices that possess the fiber-optic pigtails to enhance physical layer security (PLS). Attributing a signature to the networks or devices eases the identification and authentication of networks and systems thus reducing their vulnerability to physical and digital attacks. The signatures are generated using an optical physical unclonable function (OPUF). Considering that OPUFs are established as the most potent anti-counterfeiting tool, the created signatures are robust against malicious attacks such as tampering and cyber attacks. We investigate Rayleigh backscattering signal (RBS) as a strong OPUF to generate reliable signatures. Contrary to other OPUFs that must be fabricated, the RBS-based OPUF is an inherent feature of fibers and can be easily obtained using optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR). We evaluate the security of the generated signatures in terms of their robustness against prediction and cloning. We demonstrate the robustness of signatures against digital and physical attacks confirming the unpredictability and unclonability features of the generated signatures. We explore signature cyber security by considering the random structure of the produced signatures. To demonstrate signature reproducibility through repeated measurements, we simulate the signature of a system by adding a random Gaussian white noise to the signal. This model is proposed to address services including security, authentication, identification, and monitoring.",

    "title": "Holistic Security and Safety for Factories of the Future.",
    "abstract": "The accelerating transition of traditional industrial processes towards fully automated and intelligent manufacturing is being witnessed in almost all segments. This major adoption of enhanced technology and digitization processes has been originally embraced by the Factories of the Future and Industry 4.0 initiatives. The overall aim is to create smarter, more sustainable, and more resilient future-oriented factories. Unsurprisingly, introducing new production paradigms based on technologies such as machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics does not come at no cost as each newly incorporated technique poses various safety and security challenges. Similarly, the integration required between these techniques to establish a unified and fully interconnected environment contributes to additional threats and risks in the Factories of the Future. Accumulating and analyzing seemingly unrelated activities, occurring simultaneously in different parts of the factory, is essential to establish cyber situational awareness of the investigated environment. Our work contributes to these efforts, in essence by envisioning and implementing the SMS-DT, an integrated platform to simulate and monitor industrial conditions in a digital twin-based architecture. SMS-DT is represented in a three-tier architecture comprising the involved data and control flows: edge, platform, and enterprise tiers. The goal of our platform is to capture, analyze, and correlate a wide range of events being tracked by sensors and systems in various domains of the factory. For this aim, multiple components have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence to simulate dominant aspects in industries, including network analysis, energy optimization, and worker behavior. A data lake was also used to store collected information, and a set of intelligent services was delivered on the basis of innovative analysis and learning approaches. Finally, the platform was tested in a textile industry environment and integrated with its ERP system. Two misuse cases were simulated to track the factory machines, systems, and people and to assess the role of SMS-DT correlation mechanisms in preventing intentional and unintentional actions. The results of these misuse case simulations showed how the SMS-DT platform can intervene in two domains in the first scenario and three in the second one, resulting in correlating the alerts and reporting them to security operators in the multi-domain intelligent correlation dashboard.",

Scientists use software tools and applications for sequencing, synthesizing, analyzing and sharing of DNA and genomic data, operate lab equipment and store genetic information in shared datastores. Using cutting-edge computing methods and techniques, researchers have decoded human genome, created organisms with new capabilities, automated drug development and transformed food safety. Such software applications are typically developed to progress scientific understanding and as such cyber security is never a concern for these applications. However, with the increasing commercialisation of DNA technologies, coupled with the sensitivity of DNA data, there is a need to adopt a security-by-design approach. In this paper we investigate bio-cyber security threats to genomic-DNA data and software applications making use of such data to advance scientific research. Specifically, we adopt an empirical approach to analyse and identify vulnerabilities within genomic-DNA databases and bioinformatics software applications that can lead to cyber-attacks affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive data. We present a detailed analysis of these threats and highlight potential protection mechanisms to help researchers pursue these research directions.",

    "title": "A holistic and proactive approach to forecasting cyber threats.",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, cyber-attack detection relies on reactive, assistive techniques, where pattern-matching algorithms help human experts to scan system logs and network traffic for known virus or malware signatures. Recent research has introduced effective Machine Learning (ML) models for cyber-attack detection, promising to automate the task of detecting, tracking and blocking malware and intruders. Much less effort has been devoted to cyber-attack prediction, especially beyond the short-term time scale of hours and days. Approaches that can forecast attacks likely to happen in the longer term are desirable, as this gives defenders more time to develop and share defensive actions and tools. Today, long-term predictions of attack waves are mostly based on the subjective perceptiveness of experienced human experts, which can be impaired by the scarcity of cyber-security expertise. This paper introduces a novel ML-based approach that leverages unstructured big data and logs to forecast the trend of cyber-attacks at a large scale, years in advance. To this end, we put forward a framework that utilises a monthly dataset of major cyber incidents in 36 countries over the past 11 years, with new features extracted from three major categories of big data sources, namely the scientific research literature, news, blogs, and tweets. Our framework not only identifies future attack trends in an automated fashion, but also generates a threat cycle that drills down into five key phases that constitute the life cycle of all 42 known cyber threats.",

    "abstract": "Modern-day Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) with more than 100 million code lines, running up-to a hundred Electronic Control Units (ECUs) will create and exchange digital information with other vehicles and intelligent transport networks. Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of \"cybersecurity\". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future. This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.",

    "abstract": "In today's world, the volume of cyber attacks grows every year. These attacks can cause many people or companies high financial losses or loss of private data. One of the most common types of attack on the Internet is a DoS (denial-of-service) attack, which, despite its simplicity, can cause catastrophic consequences. A slow DoS attack attempts to make the Internet service unavailable to users. Due to the small data flows, these attacks are very similar to legitimate users with a slow Internet connection. Accurate detection of these attacks is one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity. In this paper, we implemented our proposal of eleven major and most dangerous slow DoS attacks and introduced an advanced attack generator for testing vulnerabilities of protocols, servers, and services. The main motivation for this research was the absence of a similarly comprehensive generator for testing slow DoS vulnerabilities in network systems. We built an experimental environment for testing our generator, and then we performed a security analysis of the five most used web servers. Based on the discovered vulnerabilities, we also discuss preventive and detection techniques to mitigate the attacks. In future research, our generator can be used for testing slow DoS security vulnerabilities and increasing the level of cyber security of various network systems.",

This poses severe security challenges such as limited end-to-end security support, lack of cross-platform cross-vertical security interoperability as well as the lack of security services that can be readily applied by security practitioners and third party developers. Overall, these require scalable, decentralized and intelligent IoT security mechanisms and services which are addressed by the SecureIoT project. This paper presents the definition, implementation and validation of a SecureIoT-enabled socially assisted robots (SAR) usage scenario. The aim of the SAR scenario is to integrate and validate the SecureIoT services in the scope of personalized healthcare and ambient assistive living (AAL) scenarios, involving the integration of two AAL platforms, namely QTrobot (QT) and CloudCare2U (CC2U). This includes risk assessment of communications security, predictive analysis of security risks, implementing access control policies to enhance the security of solution, and auditing of the solution against security, safety and privacy guidelines and regulations. Future perspectives include the extension of this security paradigm by securing the integration of healthcare platforms with IoT solutions, such as Healthentia with QTRobot, by means of a system product assurance process for cyber-security in healthcare applications, through the PANACEA toolkit.",

Currently there are no methods to assess the vulnerabilities/risk impact which may be exploited by malicious actors through system gaps left due to improper implementation of security standards. The authors are currently working on an Industry 4.0 cybersecurity project and the insights provided in this paper are derived from the project. This research enables an understanding of converged/hybrid cybersecurity standards, reviews the best practices, and provides a roadmap for identifying, aligning, mapping, converging, and implementing the right cybersecurity standards and strategies for securing M2M communications in the IIoT.",

    "title": "Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit.",
    "abstract": "Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.",

    "title": "Analyzing medical device connectivity and its effect on cyber security in german hospitals.",
    "abstract": "Modern healthcare devices can be connected to computer networks and many western healthcare institutions run those devices in networks. At the same time, cyber attacks are on the rise and there is evidence that cybercriminals do not spare critical infrastructure such as major hospitals, even if they endanger patients. Intuitively, the more and closer connected healthcare devices are to public networks, the higher the risk of getting attacked. To asses the current connectivity status of healthcare devices, we surveyed the field of German hospitals and especially University Medical Center UMCs. The results show a strong correlation between the networking degree and the number of medical devices. The average number of medical devices is 25.150, with a median of networked medical devices of 3.600. Actual key users of networked medical devices are the departments Radiology, Intensive Care, Radio-Oncology RO, Nuclear Medicine NUC, and Anaesthesiology in the group of UMCs. In the next five years, the usage of networked medical devices will increase significantly in the departments of Surgery, Intensive Care, and Radiology. We detected a strong correlation between the degree of connectivity and the likelihood of being attacked.The survey answers regarding the cyber security status reveal a lack of security basics in some of the inquired hospitals. We did discover successful attacks in hospitals with separated or subsidiary departments. A fusion of competencies on an organizational level facilitates the right behavior here. Most hospitals rated themselves predominantly positively in the self-assessment but also stated the usefulness of IT security insurance. Concluding our results, hospitals are already facing the consequences of omitted measures within their growing pool of medical devices. Continuously relying on historically grown structures without adaption and trusting manufactures to solve vectors is a critical behavior that could seriously endanger patients.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) integrate numerous automatic and monitor functions. Nowadays, most CIEDs are connected to the Internet (via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or smartphone) to ensure remote monitoring of technical and clinical data: despite the importance of such a monitoring, especially from a clinical point of view, concerns have been raised about information (IT) security in terms of both privacy and security for CIEDs' carriers. This review will provide an outline of remote monitoring of CIEDs, main IT security issues that have affected them so far, main cybervulnerabilities and possible solutions. Although there is no evidence that cyber-attacks have been carried out against any CIED so far, they may occur in the future. Cyber-attacks are usually aimed at stealing sensitive information or granting access to the IT systems to which CIEDs are connected; the possibility of an active reprogramming of CIEDs by cyber-attacks is extremely low. Political, regulatory, scientific, and clinical integration is essential to provide not only effective IT solutions for CIEDs and their carriers, but also for the development of educational programs; it should also promote cooperation between stakeholders in order to reduce the risk of CIEDs' cybervulnerability and increase patient safety.",

    "abstract": "The smart grid is one of the core technologies that enable sustainable economic and social developments. In recent years, various cyber attacks have targeted smart grid systems, which have led to severe, harmful consequences. It would be challenging to build a real smart grid system for cybersecurity experimentation and validation purposes. Hence, analytical techniques, with simulations, can be considered as a practical solution to make smart grid cybersecurity experimentation possible. This paper first provides a literature review on the current state-of-the-art in smart grid attack analysis. We then apply graphical security modeling techniques to design and implement a Cyber Attack Analysis Framework for Smart Grids, named GridAttackAnalyzer. A case study with various attack scenarios involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices is conducted to validate the proposed framework and demonstrate its use. The functionality and user evaluations of GridAttackAnalyzer are also carried out, and the evaluation results show that users have a satisfying experience with the usability of GridAttackAnalyzer. Our modular and extensible framework can serve multiple purposes for research, cybersecurity training, and security evaluation in smart grids.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) include bradycardia pacemakers, defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices. These devices are proven to save lives and improve quality of life in indicated patients. Recent advances in CIED technology allow interrogating and transmitting data stored in these devices wirelessly through radiofrequency or Bluetooth technology and more recently through smartphones. Remote monitoring of CIED uses telemetry and IP connectivity to transmit data from devices to the cloud and eventually to hospitals/clinics monitoring them. There has been overwhelming evidence in support of remote monitoring of CIEDs, improving patient outcomes, survival, and hospitalization. Therefore, guidelines recommend remote monitoring for all CIEDs. Remote monitoring allows frequent checks reducing clinic visits, improving efficiency of medical resources and timely intervention in patients with clinical events. Although internet of things (IOT) dependency is increasing, advantages of connectivity and data transfer come with a price of hacking, resulting in malfunction of computers, misuse of stolen data, or medical extortion. Therefore, cybersecurity has become a necessity in this digital world. Medical devices using net connectivity expose themselves to cyber attacks. Fortunately so far no hacking or cyber attack has been reported in patients with CIEDs, and most literature focuses on proof of concept and in-the-research laboratory scenarios. Although documented clinical events have not yet happened, the threat is real. It is essential to be well prepared for this potential but serious threat. It is imperative that device manufacturers, regulatory bodies, medical professionals, and patients all work together to prevent, identify, and mitigate cyber threat.",

They could be physically damaged by natural or human actions, causing service disruptions, economic losses, and, in some extreme cases, harm to people. They, therefore, need a high level of protection against possible unintentional and intentional events. In this paper, we show a logical architecture that exploits information from both physical and cybersecurity systems to improve the overall security in a power plant scenario. We propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection approach to detect possible anomaly events by jointly correlating data related to both the physical and cyber domains. The performance evaluation showed encouraging results-obtained by different ML algorithms-which highlights how our proposed approach is able to detect possible abnormal situations that could not have been detected by using only information from either the physical or cyber domain.",

In the 2013 risk report, cyber attacks were noted to be an even higher risk in absolute terms. The reliance of critical infrastructure on cyber working has never been higher; the frequency, intensity, impact and sophistication of attacks is growing. This trend looks likely to continue. It can be argued that it is no longer a question whether an organisation will be successfully hacked, but how long it will take to detect. In the ever-changing cyber environment, traditional protection techniques and reliance on preventive controls are not enough. A more agile approach is required to give assurance of a sufficiently secure digital society. Are we faced with a paradigm shift or a storm in a digital teacup? This paper offers an introduction to why cyber is important, a wider taxonomy on the topic and some historical context on how the discipline of cyber security has evolved, and an interpretation on what this means in the new normal of today.",

    "abstract": "Information security and privacy are matters of concern in every industry. The healthcare sector has lagged in terms of implementing cybersecurity measures. Therefore, hospitals are more exposed to cyber events due to the criticality of patient data. Currently, little is known about state-of-the-art research on information security and privacy in hospitals. The purpose of this study is to report the outcome of a systematic literature review on research about the application of information security and privacy in hospitals. A systematic literature review following the PRISMA methodology was conducted. To reference our sample according to cybersecurity domains, we benchmarked each article against two cybersecurity frameworks: ISO 27001 Annex A and the NIST framework core. Limited articles in our papers referred to the policies and compliance sections of ISO 27001. In addition, most of our sample is classified by the NIST function \"Protect,\" meaning activities related to identity management, access control and data security. Furthermore, we have identified key domains where research in security and privacy are critical, such as big data, IOT, cloud computing, standards and regulations. The results indicate that although cybersecurity is a growing concern in hospitals, research is still weak in some areas. Considering the recrudescence of cyber-attacks in the healthcare sector, we call for more research in hospitals in managerial and non-technical domains of information security and privacy that are uncovered by our analysis.",

A recurring pattern is strategic dilemmas that cannot be resolved satisfactorily. Some dilemmas are more pronounced, others less so, and therefore often catch decision-makers unprepared, leaving only bad options for decision-making. Something that all dilemmas have in common is that the associated decisions can have a lasting impact on relationships with stakeholders. This paper introduces four recurring dilemmas; shows the typical considerations; lists options for mitigating these dilemmas; and describes the basic requirements for implementing mitigations. The dilemmas and options, in turn, are rooted in the organisation-specific design of: cyber security incident management and response; IT service continuity and disaster recovery management; business continuity management; and crisis management and communication.",

    "title": "Systemic Cyber Risk and Aggregate Impacts.",
    "abstract": "With some of the largest cyber attacks occurring in recent years-from 2010 to 2019-we are only beginning to understand the full extent of cyber risk. As businesses grapple with the risks of cyber-incidents and their imperfect ability to prevent them, attention has shifted toward risk management and insurance. While there have been efforts to understand the costs of cyber attacks, the systemic risk-a result of risks spreading across interdependent systems-associated with cyber attacks remains a critical and problem in need of further study. We contribute a theoretical framework that describes systemic cyber risk as the result of cascading, common cause, or independent failures following a cyber incident. We construct a quantitative model of cascading failures to estimate the potential economic damage associated with a given cyber incident. We present an interdisciplinary approach for extending standard sector-level input-output analyses to the cyber domain, which has not been done. We estimate the aggregate losses associated with firm-level incidents, a contribution to risk analysis and computational economic modeling. We use this model to estimate the impact of potential cyber incidents and compare model results to a case with known damages. Finally, we use the model of systemic cyber failure to consider the implications on the growing cyber insurance market and the need for broader cyber policy. While we discuss the topic of systemic cyber risk, our contribution of using I/O analysis to estimate the aggregate losses from firm-level incidents is applicable across a variety of risk analysis applications from environment to health.",

The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey on the current biometrics research in IoT security, especially focusing on two important aspects, authentication and encryption. Regarding authentication, contemporary biometric-based authentication systems for IoT are discussed and classified based on different biometric traits and the number of biometric traits employed in the system. As for encryption, biometric-cryptographic systems, which integrate biometrics with cryptography and take advantage of both to provide enhanced security for IoT, are thoroughly reviewed and discussed. Moreover, challenges arising from applying biometrics to IoT and potential solutions are identified and analyzed. With an insight into the state-of-the-art research in biometrics for IoT security, this review paper helps advance the study in the field and assists researchers in gaining a good understanding of forward-looking issues and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks have changed dramatically and have become highly advanced. This latest phenomenon has a massive negative impact on organizations, such as financial losses and shutting-down of operations. Therefore, developing and implementing the Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC) is imperative and timely. Based on previous research, there are no international guidelines and standards used by organizations that can contribute to the successful implementation and development of SOC. In this regard, this study focuses on highlighting the significant factors that will impact and contribute to the success of SOC. Simultaneously, it will further design a model for the successful development and implementation of SOC for the organization. The study was conducted quantitatively and involved 63 respondents from 25 ministries and agencies in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable the retrieval of ten success factors for SOC, and it specifically focuses on humans, processes, and technology. The descriptive analysis shows that the top management support factor is the most influential factor in the success of the development and implementation of SOC. The study also contributes to the empirical finding that technology and process factors are more significant in the success of SOCs. Based on the regression test, the technology factor has major impact on determining the success of SOC, followed by the process and human factors. Relevant organizations or agencies can use the proposed model to develop and implement SOCs, formulate policies and guidelines, strengthen human models, and enhance cyber security.",

    "title": "Evaluating Staff Attitudes, Intentions, and Behaviors Related to Cyber Security in Large Australian Health Care Environments: Mixed Methods Study.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified that the effective management of cyber security in large health care environments is likely to be significantly impacted by human and social factors, as well as by technical controls. However, there have been limited attempts to confirm this by using measured and integrated studies to identify specific user motivations and behaviors that can be managed to achieve improved outcomes. This study aims to document and analyze survey and interview data from a diverse range of health care staff members, to determine the primary motivations and behaviors that influence their acceptance and application of cyber security messaging and controls. By identifying these issues, recommendations can be made to positively influence future cyber security governance in health care. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was undertaken to analyze quantitative data from a web-based staff survey (N=103), with a concurrent qualitative investigation applied to data gathered via in-depth staff interviews (N=9). Data from both stages of this methodology were mapped to descriptive variables based on a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; TAM2). After normalization, the quantitative data were verified and analyzed using descriptive statistics, distribution and linearity measures, and a bivariate correlation of the TAM variables to identify the Pearson coefficient (r) and significance (P) values. Finally, after confirming Cronbach α, the determinant score for multicollinearity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure, and applying the Bartlett test of sphericity (χ ), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the primary factors with an eigenvalue (λ) >1.0. Comments captured during the qualitative interviews were coded using NVivo software (QSR International) to create an emic-to-etic understanding, which was subsequently integrated with the quantitative results to produce verified conclusions. Using the explanatory sequential methodology, this study showed that the perceived usefulness of security controls emerged as the most significant factor influencing staff beliefs and behaviors. This variable represented 24% of all the variances measured in the EFA and was also the most common category identified across all coded interviews (281/692, 40.6%). The word frequency analysis showed that systems, patients, and people represented the top 3 recurring themes reported by the interviewees. To improve cyber security governance in large health care environments, efforts should be focused on demonstrating how confidentiality, integrity, availability, policies, and cloud or vendor-based controls (the main contributors of usefulness measured by the EFA) can directly improve outcomes for systems, staff, and patients. Further consideration also needs to be given to how clinicians should share data and collaborate on patient care, with tools and processes provided to support and manage data sharing securely and to achieve a consistent baseline of secure and normalized behaviors.",

    "title": "Bio-Inspired Approaches to Safety and Security in IoT-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems.",
    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have profoundly influenced the way individuals and enterprises interact with the world. Although attacks on IoT devices are becoming more commonplace, security metrics often focus on software, network, and cloud security. For CPS systems employed in IoT applications, the implementation of hardware security is crucial. The identity of electronic circuits measured in terms of device parameters serves as a fingerprint. Estimating the parameters of this fingerprint assists the identification and prevention of Trojan attacks in a CPS. We demonstrate a bio-inspired approach for hardware Trojan detection using unsupervised learning methods. The bio-inspired principles of pattern identification use a , and form the basis of this work. When hardware device parameters are in an acceptable range, the design produces a stable firing pattern. When unbalanced, the firing rate reduces to zero, indicating the presence of a Trojan. This network is tunable to accommodate natural variations in device parameters and to avoid false triggering of Trojan alerts. The tolerance is tuned using bio-inspired principles for various security requirements, such as forming high-alert systems for safety-critical missions. The Trojan detection circuit is resilient to a range of faults and attacks, both intentional and unintentional. Also, we devise a design-for-trust architecture by developing a bio-inspired device-locking mechanism. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Results demonstrate the suitability of the proposal for resource-constrained environments with minimal hardware and power dissipation profiles. The design is tested with a wide range of device parameters to demonstrate the effectiveness of Trojan detection. This work serves as a new approach to enable secure CPSs and to employ bio-inspired unsupervised machine intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Recent legislation empowering providers to embrace the electronic exchange of health information leaves the healthcare industry increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime. The objective of this systematic review is to identify the biggest threats to healthcare via cybercrime. The rationale behind this systematic review is to provide a framework for future research by identifying themes and trends of cybercrime in the healthcare industry. The authors conducted a systematic search through the CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases to gather literature relative to cyber threats in healthcare. All authors reviewed the articles collected and excluded literature that did not focus on the objective. Researchers selected and examined 19 articles for common themes. The most prevalent cyber-criminal activity in healthcare is identity theft through data breach. Other concepts identified are internal threats, external threats, cyber-squatting, and cyberterrorism. The industry has now come to rely heavily on digital technologies, which increase risks such as denial of service and data breaches. Current healthcare cyber-security systems do not rival the capabilities of cyber criminals. Security of information is a costly resource and therefore many HCOs may hesitate to invest what is required to protect sensitive information.",

    "title": "Breaking down silos between business continuity and cyber security.",
    "abstract": "Every year, most businesses experience a cyber attack of some sort. Despite the fact that these attacks can interrupt business operations, many organisations lack an effective business continuity response. While some organisations do have cyber security and incident response functions in place, they focus more on mitigating the attack itself than on ensuring business operations can continue in the interim. To understand why it is important to integrate cyber security into the business continuity plan, business continuity planners must first be familiar with the common cyber threats organisations face as well as the far-reaching impact of data breaches. Then, they must address the root causes of the breakdown between business continuity and cyber security: the lack of a security culture, boardroom support and a coordinated response. Practical steps for integrating cyber security into the business continuity response include starting a conversation with those responsible for cyber security, determining the appropriate response to cyber incidents, assessing the organisation's recovery needs and testing the response strategy. Ideally, however, organisations should prevent attacks altogether. As employees are often the primary point of failure in cyber security preparedness, organisations should improve their cyber security posture by investing in education and awareness from the top down.",

    "abstract": "The increased adoption of digital systems in the maritime domain has led to concerns about cyber resilience, especially in the wake of increasingly disruptive cyber-attacks. This has seen vessel operators increasingly adopt Maritime Security Operation Centers (M-SOCs), an action in line with one of the cyber resilience engineering techniques known as adaptive response, whose purpose is to optimize the ability to respond promptly to attacks. This research sought to investigate the domain-specific human factors that influence the adaptive response capabilities of M-SOC analysts to vessel cyber threats. Through collecting interview data and subsequent thematic analysis informed by grounded theory, cyber awareness of both crew onboard and vessel operators emerged as a pressing domain-specific challenge impacting M-SOC analysts' adaptive response. The key takeaway from this study is that vessel operators remain pivotal in supporting the M-SOC analysts' adaptive response processes through resource allocation towards operational technology (OT) monitoring and cyber personnel staffing onboard the vessels.",

    "title": "Breaking the cyber-security dilemma: aligning security needs and removing vulnerabilities.",
    "abstract": "Current approaches to cyber-security are not working. Rather than producing more security, we seem to be facing less and less. The reason for this is a multi-dimensional and multi-faceted security dilemma that extends beyond the state and its interaction with other states. It will be shown how the focus on the state and \"its\" security crowds out consideration for the security of the individual citizen, with detrimental effects on the security of the whole system. The threat arising from cyberspace to (national) security is presented as possible disruption to a specific way of life, one building on information technologies and critical functions of infrastructures, with relatively little consideration for humans directly. This non-focus on people makes it easier for state actors to militarize cyber-security and (re-)assert their power in cyberspace, thereby overriding the different security needs of human beings in that space. Paradoxically, the use of cyberspace as a tool for national security, both in the dimension of war fighting and the dimension of mass-surveillance, has detrimental effects on the level of cyber-security globally. A solution out of this dilemma is a cyber-security policy that is decidedly anti-vulnerability and at the same time based on strong considerations for privacy and data protection. Such a security would have to be informed by an ethics of the infosphere that is based on the dignity of information related to human beings.",

IoT devices are in danger of security issues due to the surge in hacker attacks during Internet data exchange. If such strong attacks are to create a reliable security system, attack detection is essential. Attacks and abnormalities such as user-to-root (U2R), denial-of-service, and data-type probing could have an impact on an IoT system. This article examines various performance-based AI models to predict attacks and problems with IoT devices with accuracy. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms, and ant colony optimization were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested technique concerning four different parameters. The results of the proposed method employing PSO outperformed those of the existing systems by roughly 73 percent.",

    "title": "Roman Urdu Hate Speech Detection Using Transformer-Based Model for Cyber Security Applications.",
    "abstract": "Social media applications, such as Twitter and Facebook, allow users to communicate and share their thoughts, status updates, opinions, photographs, and videos around the globe. Unfortunately, some people utilize these platforms to disseminate hate speech and abusive language. The growth of hate speech may result in hate crimes, cyber violence, and substantial harm to cyberspace, physical security, and social safety. As a result, hate speech detection is a critical issue for both cyberspace and physical society, necessitating the development of a robust application capable of detecting and combating it in real-time. Hate speech detection is a context-dependent problem that requires context-aware mechanisms for resolution. In this study, we employed a transformer-based model for Roman Urdu hate speech classification due to its ability to capture the text context. In addition, we developed the first Roman Urdu pre-trained BERT model, which we named BERT-RU. For this purpose, we exploited the capabilities of BERT by training it from scratch on the largest Roman Urdu dataset consisting of 173,714 text messages. Traditional and deep learning models were used as baseline models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, BiLSTM + Attention Layer, and CNN. We also investigated the concept of transfer learning by using pre-trained BERT embeddings in conjunction with deep learning models. The performance of each model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The generalization of each model was evaluated on a cross-domain dataset. The experimental results revealed that the transformer-based model, when directly applied to the classification task of the Roman Urdu hate speech, outperformed traditional machine learning, deep learning models, and pre-trained transformer-based models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, with scores of 96.70%, 97.25%, 96.74%, and 97.89%, respectively. In addition, the transformer-based model exhibited superior generalization on a cross-domain dataset.",

About the same time, a multi-society collaboration authored an ACR Guideline with a similar plot; the latter has recently been updated. The motivation for these efforts was the launch of Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That legislation directed care providers to enable the portability of patient medical records across authorized medical centers, while simultaneously protecting patient confidentiality among unauthorized agents. These policy requirements resulted in the creation of numerous technical solutions which the above documents described. While the mathematical concepts and algorithms in those papers are as valid today as they were then, recent increases in the complexity of computer criminal applications (and defensive countermeasures) and the pervasiveness of Internet connected devices have raised the bar.

We propose the Threat identification, ontology-based Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk assessment (TLDR) methodology and demonstrate its feasibility and consistency with existing methodologies, while being more efficient, providing details regarding the severity components, and supporting organizational prioritization and customization. Using our methodology, the impact of 23 MIDs attacks (that were previously identified) was decomposed into six severity aspects. Four Radiology Medical Experts (RMEs) were asked to assess these six aspects for each attack. The TLDR methodology's external consistency was demonstrated by calculating paired T-tests between TLDR severity assessments and those of existing methodologies (and between the respective overall risk assessments, using attack likelihood estimates by four healthcare cyber-security experts); the differences were insignificant, implying externally consistent risk assessment. The TLDR methodology's internal consistency was evaluated by calculating the pairwise Spearman rank correlations between the severity assessments of different groups of two to four RMEs and each of their individual group members, showing that the correlations between the severity rankings, using the TLDR methodology, were significant (P < 0.05), demonstrating that the severity rankings were internally consistent for all groups of RMEs. Using existing methodologies, however, the internal correlations were insignificant for groups of less than four RMEs. Furthermore, compared to standard risk assessment techniques, the TLDR methodology is also sensitive to local radiologists' preferences, supports a greater level of flexibility regarding risk prioritization, and produces more transparent risk assessments.",

Like any disruptive technology, its growing popularity inevitably attracts cyber security actors, for whom the health sector is attractive because it combines mission-critical infrastructure and high-value data with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In this Perspective, we explore cyber security aspects of microbial NGS. We discuss the motivations and objectives for such attack, its feasibility and implications, and highlight policy considerations aimed at threat mitigation. Particular focus is placed on the attack vectors, where the entire process of NGS, from sample to result, could be vulnerable, and a risk assessment based on probability and impact for representative attack vectors is presented. Cyber attacks on microbial NGS could result in loss of confidentiality (leakage of personal or institutional data), integrity (misdetection of pathogens) and availability (denial of sequencing services). NGS platforms are also at risk of being used as propagation vectors, compromising an entire system or network. Owing to the rapid evolution of microbial NGS and its applications, and in light of the dynamics of the cyber security domain, frequent risk assessments should be carried out in order to identify new threats and underpin constantly updated public health policies.",

    "title": "Augmented Reality (AR) and Cyber-Security for Smart Cities-A Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) and cyber-security technologies have existed for several decades, but their growth and progress in recent years have increased exponentially. The areas of application for these technologies are clearly heterogeneous, most especially in purchase and sales, production, tourism, education, as well as social interaction (games, entertainment, communication). Essentially, these technologies are recognized worldwide as some of the pillars of the new industrial revolution envisaged by the industry 4.0 international program, and are some of the leading technologies of the 21st century. The ability to provide users with required information about processes or procedures directly into the virtual environment is archetypally the fundamental factor in considering AR as an effective tool for different fields. However, the advancement in ICT has also brought about a variety of cybersecurity challenges, with a depth of evidence anticipating policy, architectural, design, and technical solutions in this very domain. The specific applications of AR and cybersecurity technologies have been described in detail in a variety of papers, which demonstrate their potential in diverse fields. In the context of smart cities, however, there is a dearth of sources describing their varied uses. Notably, a scholarly paper that consolidates research on AR and cybersecurity application in this context is markedly lacking. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to identify, describe, and synthesize research findings on the application of AR and cybersecurity for smart cities. The review study involves filtering information of their application in this setting from three key databases to answer the predefined research question. The keynote part of this paper provides an in-depth review of some of the most recent AR and cybersecurity applications for smart cities, emphasizing potential benefits, limitations, as well as open issues which could represent new challenges for the future. The main finding that we found is that there are five main categories of these applications for smart cities, which can be classified according to the main articles, such as tourism, monitoring, system management, education, and mobility. Compared with the general literature on smart cities, tourism, monitoring, and maintenance AR applications appear to attract more scholarly attention.",

    "title": "Influence of Human Factors on Cyber Security within Healthcare Organisations: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Cybersecurity is increasingly becoming a prominent concern among healthcare providers in adopting digital technologies for improving the quality of care delivered to patients. The recent reports on cyber attacks, such as ransomware and WannaCry, have brought to life the destructive nature of such attacks upon healthcare. In complement to cyberattacks, which have been targeted against the vulnerabilities of information technology (IT) infrastructures, a new form of cyber attack aims to exploit human vulnerabilities; such attacks are categorised as social engineering attacks. Following an increase in the frequency and ingenuity of attacks launched against hospitals and clinical environments with the intention of causing service disruption, there is a strong need to study the level of awareness programmes and training activities offered to the staff by healthcare organisations. The objective of this systematic review is to identify commonly encountered factors that cybersecurity postures of a healthcare organisation, resulting from the ignorance of cyber threat to healthcare. The systematic review aims to consolidate the current literature being reported upon human behaviour resulting in security gaps that mitigate the cyber defence strategy adopted by healthcare organisations. Additionally, the paper also reviews the organisational risk assessment methodology implemented and the policies being adopted to strengthen cybersecurity. The topic of cybersecurity within healthcare and the clinical environment has attracted the interest of several researchers, resulting in a broad range of literature. The inclusion criteria for the articles in the review stem from the scope of the five research questions identified. To this end, we conducted seven search queries across three repositories, namely (i) PubMed /MED-LINE; (ii) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and (iii) Web of Science (WoS), using key words related to cybersecurity awareness, training, organisation risk assessment methodologies, policies and recommendations adopted as counter measures within health care. These were restricted to around the last 12 years. A total of 70 articles were selected to be included in the review, which addresses the complexity of cybersecurity measures adopted within the healthcare and clinical environments. The articles included in the review highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats stemming from exploiting IT infrastructures to more advanced attacks launched with the intent of exploiting human vulnerability. A steady increase in the literature on the threat of phishing attacks evidences the growing threat of social engineering attacks. As a countermeasure, through the review, we identified articles that provide methodologies resulting from case studies to promote cybersecurity awareness among stakeholders. The articles included highlight the need to adopt cyber hygiene practices among healthcare professionals while accessing social media platforms, which forms an ideal test bed for the attackers to gain insight into the life of healthcare professionals. Additionally, the review also includes articles that present strategies adopted by healthcare organisations in countering the impact of social engineering attacks. The evaluation of the cybersecurity risk assessment of an organisation is another key area of study reported in the literature that recommends the organisation of European and international standards in countering social engineering attacks. Lastly, the review includes articles reporting on national case studies with an overview of the economic and societal impact of service disruptions encountered due to cyberattacks. One of the limitations of the review is the subjective ranking of the authors associated to the relevance of literature to each of the research questions identified. We also acknowledge the limited amount of literature that focuses on human factors of cybersecurity in health care in general; therefore, the search queries were formulated using well-established cybersecurity related topics categorised according to the threats, risk assessment and organisational strategies reported in the literature.",

    "title": "Defining Cyber Security and Cyber Security Risk within a Multidisciplinary Context using Expert Elicitation.",
    "abstract": "It is important to have and use standardized terminology and develop a comprehensive common understanding of what is meant by cyber security and cyber security risk given the multidisciplinary nature of cyber security and the pervasiveness of cyber security concerns throughout society. Using expert elicitation methods, collaborating cyber researchers from multiple disciplines and two sectors (academia, government-military) were individually interviewed and asked to define cyber security and cyber security risk. Data-driven thematic analysis was used to identify the most salient themes within each definition, sector, and cyber expert group as a whole with results compared to current standards definitions. Network analysis was employed to visualize the interconnection of salient themes within and across sectors and disciplines. When examined as a whole group, \"context-driven,\" \"resilient system functionality,\" and \"maintenance of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability)\" were the most salient themes and influential network nodes for the definition of cyber security, while \"impacts of CIA vulnerabilities,\" \"probabilities of outcomes,\" and \"context-driven\" were the most salient themes for cyber security risk. We used this expert elicitation process to develop comprehensive definitions of cyber security (cybersecurity) and cyber security risk that encompass the contextual frameworks of all the disciplines represented in the collaboration and explicitly incorporates human factors as significant cyber security risk factors.",

    "title": "Cyber-Security Threats and Side-Channel Attacks for Digital Agriculture.",
    "abstract": "The invention of smart low-power devices and ubiquitous Internet connectivity have facilitated the shift of many labour-intensive jobs into the digital domain. The shortage of skilled workforce and the growing food demand have led the agriculture sector to adapt to the digital transformation. Smart sensors and systems are used to monitor crops, plants, the environment, water, soil moisture, and diseases. The transformation to digital agriculture would improve the quality and quantity of food for the ever-increasing human population. This paper discusses the security threats and vulnerabilities to digital agriculture, which are overlooked in other published articles. It also provides a comprehensive review of the side-channel attacks (SCA) specific to digital agriculture, which have not been explored previously. The paper also discusses the open research challenges and future directions.",
