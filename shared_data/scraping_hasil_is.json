    "title": "Transforming the health information system using mobile and geographic information technologies, Papua New Guinea.",
    "abstract": "In the context of declining economic growth, now exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, Papua New Guinea is increasing the efficiency of its health systems to overcome difficulties in reaching global health and development targets. Before 2015, the national health information system was fragmented, underfunded, of limited utility and accessed infrequently by health authorities. We built an electronic system that integrated mobile technologies and geographic information system data sets of every house, village and health facility in the country. We piloted the system in 184 health facilities across five provinces between 2015 and 2016. By the end of 2020, the system's mobile tablets were rolled out to 473 facilities in 13 provinces, while the online platform was available in health authorities of all 22 provinces, including church health services. Fractured data siloes of legacy health programmes have been integrated and a platform for civil registration systems established. We discuss how mobile technologies and geographic information systems have transformed health information systems in Papua New Guinea over the past 6 years by increasing the timeliness, completeness, quality, accessibility, flexibility, acceptability and utility of national health data. To achieve this transformation, we highlight the importance of considering the benefits of mobile tools and using rich geographic information systems data sets for health workers in primary care in addition to the needs of public health authorities.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of an intelligent, comprehensive, and all-encompassing information system for tourism management is the current trend in tourism informatization as a result of the continual development of modern information technology. Significant advancements in the field of VRGIS and its usage in research have been made as a result of the use of VRGIS to categorize, assess, plan, and manage tourism resources. The analysis of the recent development of VRGIS in tourism resource research is the first section of this work. This study examines and implements a mobile, computerized, and intelligent tourism service system that gives visitors a sense of the surrounding landscape using VRGIS. Three-dimensional mapping, environment detection, personal trajectory, and Weibo sharing are just a few of the system's many helpful features. While travelling, tourists can get services that are more intelligent and practical. The drawbacks of conventional geographic information systems include their reliance on sophisticated models, network limitations, and operational challenges. New software architecture is put in place to get rid of network restrictions, virtual reality peripherals are used to make operation more convenient, and system modeling is rebuilt using the TIN data model and model simplification. The results of experiments show improved refresh rates and peripheral expansion modules. The user experience is enhanced by this research.",

    "title": "A patient privacy protection scheme for medical information system.",
    "abstract": "In medical information systems, there are a lot of confidential information about patient privacy. It is therefore an important problem how to prevent patient's personal privacy information from being disclosed. Although traditional security protection strategies (such as identity authentication and authorization access control) can well ensure data integrity, they cannot prevent system's internal staff (such as administrators) from accessing and disclosing patient privacy information. In this paper, we present an effective scheme to protect patients' personal privacy for a medical information system. In the scheme, privacy data before being stored in the database of the server of a medical information system would be encrypted using traditional encryption algorithms, so that the data even if being disclosed are also difficult to be decrypted and understood. However, to execute various kinds of query operations over the encrypted data efficiently, we would also augment the encrypted data with additional index, so as to process as much of the query as possible at the server side, without the need to decrypt the data. Thus, in this paper, we mainly explore how the index of privacy data is constructed, and how a query operation over privacy data is translated into a new query over the corresponding index so that it can be executed at the server side immediately. Finally, both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation validate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",

    "title": "Battling the challenges of training nurses to use information systems through theory-based training material design.",
    "abstract": "The attempts to train nurses to effectively use information systems have had mixed results. One problem is that training materials are not adequately designed to guide trainees to gradually learn to use a system without experiencing a heavy cognitive load. This is because training design often does not take into consideration a learner's cognitive ability to absorb new information in a short training period. Given the high cost and difficulty of organising training in healthcare organisations, there is an urgent need for information system trainers to be aware of how cognitive overload or information overload affect a trainee's capability to acquire new knowledge and skills, and what instructional techniques can be used to facilitate effective learning. This paper introduces the concept of cognitive load and how it affects nurses when learning to use a new health information system. This is followed by the relevant strategies for instructional design, underpinned by the principles of cognitive load theory, which may be helpful for the development of effective instructional materials and activities for training nurses to use information systems.",

    "abstract": "As increasingly powerful informatics systems are designed, developed, and implemented, they inevitably affect larger, more heterogeneous groups of people and more organizational areas. In turn, the major challenges to system success are often more behavioral than technical. Successfully introducing such systems into complex health care organizations requires an effective blend of good technical and good organizational skills. People who have low psychological ownership in a system and who vigorously resist its implementation can bring a \"technically best\" system to its knees. However, effective leadership can sharply reduce the behavioral resistance to change-including to new technologies-to achieve a more rapid and productive introduction of informatics technology. This paper looks at four major areas-why information system failures occur, the core theories supporting change management, the practical applications of change management, and the change management efforts in informatics.",

As the scale and complexity of such delivery systems has increased, the use of computer-based information systems has become a necessity. The evolution of a client information system in a large, decentralized mental health center is reviewed in this paper to illustrate several critical issues that can be encountered in the application of computer-based technology to human services. An analysis of the center's existing information system and the development of the data forms and procedures necessary for a second-generation system to meet information needs revealed the unique data structure and analysis problems of human service delivery systems. These problems were complicated by regulatory agencies' imposition of external reporting requirements that frequently were unpredictable and inconsistent. Finally, planning and negotiations with the participation of all involved parties demonstrated that formal and informal administrative constraints and conflicting interests within human service organizations must be accommodated or a system may fail. All of these factors combine to highlight both the problems and the need for highly flexible multipurpose information systems.",

Documents were surveyed in the Indigenous Peoples' Health Department of the National Health Foundation, followed by comparative analyses with other health information systems. The SIASI is organized in eight modules, three of which were in operation at the time of the study. The system's main limitations involve data collection instruments, human resources training, lack of interface with other national health information systems, difficult access to the data, and non-utilization of the data to plan subsequent health activities. The potentialities include the system's simplicity, comprehensiveness, and possibilities for disaggregating data. The study highlights the importance of a specific health information system for indigenous peoples, due to their socio-cultural and demographic specificities.",

This study examines the antagonisms discussed during the design of an information system for 175,000 users in a public health context. Discourse analysis methods were used for data collection and analysis. Three hundred and twenty-six conflict events were identified from four design meetings and divided into 16 categories. There were no differences regarding the types of conflicts that the different participants brought into the design discussions. Instead, conflict occurrence was primarily affected by the agendas that set the stage for examinations and debates. The results indicate that the selection of design method and the structure used for the meetings are important factors for the manner in which conflicts are brought into consideration during health information system design. Further studies comparing participatory and non-participatory information system design practices in health service settings are warranted.",

    "title": "An integrated approach to stakeholder engagement.",
    "abstract": "The Wait Time Information System (WTIS) project was a complex change-management initiative. For the first time in Ontario, wait time data would be captured directly from clinician offices and publicly reported in an effort to improve access to care. The change meant using new technology, new business processes and, most importantly, a new dimension of accountability for making improvements within the health system. Success required engaging thousands of individuals at all levels of healthcare, many of whom were skeptical and resistant to the upcoming change, and subsequently gaining their support and motivating them to use the WTIS and its data. To achieve the level of stakeholder engagement that would be required to deploy and sustain the WTIS, the project team needed to address both the business reasons for change, and the emotional reactions to it. The team applied a three-pronged approach encompassing strong communications, compelling adoption efforts and hands-on training. Communication focused on awareness and education, ensuring that information was coordinated, consistent and transparent. Adoption efforts involved helping hospitals and users understand and prepare for the impact of change. Training provided hands-on practice to get people comfortable with using the system. This article explores how information management/information technology (IM/IT) projects can integrate communications, adoption and training to drive stakeholder engagement. It also provides insight around how, when used effectively, these functions can maximize limited resources and provide valuable benefits.",

    "abstract": "Health information is essential for proper management and deployment of limited resources in the health services of the Pacific Islands. There have been numerous efforts to establish and strengthen sustainable information systems but the common feature of these attempts has been the very limited achievement. Subsequently, the use of information as a management tool has been abandoned in favour of 'gut feeling', hearsay and adhocry. In the last decade health planning and primary health care activities have necessitated the re-emphasis of monitoring and surveillance of health and health service indicators. Therefore a revival of interest in health information systems is taking place. A review of national health information systems in the Pacific showed that routinely collected data remained largely untouched by human thought. The contributing factors to the current inertia are examined with suggestions on how to elevate health information from its current lowly status to its rightful place as an essential tool for management. The special problems of small island states, like limited resources, geographical isolation, natural barriers to technology, and diverse cultural milieu, will be examined in relation to an appropriate health information system for Pacific Island countries in the twenty-first century.",

A targeted privacy impact assessment was implemented to identify the best architecture for a European information system for diabetes directly tapping into clinical registries. Four steps were used to provide input to software designers and developers: a structured literature search, analysis of data flow scenarios or options, creation of an ad hoc questionnaire and conduction of a Delphi procedure. The literature search identified a core set of relevant papers on privacy (n = 11). Technicians envisaged three candidate system architectures, with associated data flows, to source an information flow questionnaire that was submitted to the Delphi panel for the selection of the best architecture. A detailed scheme envisaging an \"aggregation by group of patients\" was finally chosen, based upon the exchange of finely tuned summary tables. Public health information systems should be carefully engineered only after a clear strategy for privacy protection has been planned, to avoid breaching current regulations and future concerns and to optimise the development of statistical routines. The BIRO (Best Information Through Regional Outcomes) project delivers a specific method of privacy impact assessment that can be conveniently used in similar situations across Europe.",

To standardize information it is necessary to define standards and semantic information to enable us to identify concepts and relate them uniquely to each other. The definition of a catalog of entities (DEA) with concepts, attributes and domains will enable the configuration of the information system, so there will be a catalog of entities (concepts of information and domains). Based on operational systems, analytical systems enabling management and strategy in the management of organizations will be built.

The variables analyzed were: skin color/race of newborn, maternal schooling, maternal marital status, maternal occupation, maternal age, prenatal visits, live births, stillbirths, and birth weight. For most of the variables, SINASC shows good data completeness and consistency, but there were serious problems with the quality of data on previous children and maternal occupation. Related to race, there were some methodological problems in the definition and incomplete filling-in for the Federal District (Brasília) and the States of São Paulo, Bahia, and Sergipe. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant association between data completeness and indicators of poverty and inequality. The study showed that improvements in SINASC data quality could make this system a good epidemiological source for identifying risk factors and socioeconomic conditioning factors.",

Simon (manager of personnel information systems and benefits administration of Bechtel Power Corporation) will stand the personnel manager in good stead. Focusing on the minimum capabilities that any HRIS should possess, he discusses the basic functions of input, data maintenance, and output in terms of both standard and optional items. This is not to say, however, that the personnel manager need do no homework. Simon emphasizes the importance having carefully and accurately defined the data required to support a company's personnel functions before software evaluation even begins. And he notes that human resources managers will have to familiarize themselves with some of the data processing terminology in use, just as the data processors have to familiarize themselves with personnel terminology. Simon illustrates the text with eight exhibits that clarify the functions explained to help the reader translate the concepts involved in terms of his or her organization's needs.",

Our aim was to inquire into the nature of usability problems experienced by novice and expert users, and to see to what extend usability problems of a health care information system may or may not disappear over time, as the nurses get more familiar with it - if time heals poor design. On the basis of our study, we present findings on the usability of the electronic patient system as experienced by the nurses at these two different points in time and discuss implications for evaluating usability in health care.",

All data banks and electronic textbooks are connected associatively. Visual information is obtained via the image data bank connected to the diagnosis data bank and the electronic books. Moreover, DOPIS has an integrated patient findings system, as well as an image processing and archiving system with research values enabling research functions. The diagnosis and literature data banks can be modified by the user or author, or fed with their own data (a so-called Expert System Shell). For authors from special fields working on the project, an extra Medical Electronic Publishing System has been developed and made available for the electronic textbooks.

All the information required by these different partners can be shared with independent security mechanisms. Database engine functions are carried out by the card, which manages tables, views, and dictionaries. Medical Information is stored in tables and views are logical and dynamic subsets of tables. For owner-partners like MIS (Medical Information System), it is possible to grant privileges (select, insert, update, and delete on table or view) to other partners. Furthermore, dictionaries are structures that contain requested descriptions and which allow adaptation to computer environments. Health information held in the CQL-Card is accessed using CQL (Card Query Language), a high level database query language which is a subset of the standard SQL (Structured Query Language). With this language, CQL-Card can be easily integrated into Medical Information Systems.",

    "title": "The web browser as a unifying agent for radiology and the health care enterprise.",
    "abstract": "A variety of information systems in the health care enterprise are used to store patient information. The hospital information system (HIS), the picture archiving and communications system (PACS), the radiology information systems (RIS), and patient records, for example, are often supported by separate and distinct systems. A referring physician reviewing a radiologist's report often does not have convenient access to the original radiologic images. A radiologist interpreting a radiologic examination may not have convenient access to clinical information generated outside of the radiology department. Clearly, convenient and quick access to all relevant patient information is the ideal in delivering quality patient care. Recently, the web browser has become increasingly well accepted as the \"universal client\" for viewing a wide variety of information. We believe that the web browser may provide the universal \"window\" to the variety of distinct information sources required by the physician, and may provide unification of these information sources through hypertext links. We specifically looked at the feasibility of using the web browser to view scanned patient charts. A total of 5,200 patient charts (131,000 pages) were scanned into a structured query language (SQL) database. Access to these records was made available on the hospital local area network (LAN), and on the Internet over the worldwide web. Comparison measurements were made of the time required to access patient records using a dedicated viewing application and using a web browser.",

Strengthening the recording and reporting systems for health monitoring is a basic requirement for an efficient health information management system. Increased advocacy for and awareness of a uniform coding system together with adequate capacity building of physicians, coders and other allied health and information technology personnel would pave the way for a valid and reliable health information management system in India. The core requirements for the implementation of disease coding are: (i) support from national/institutional health administrators, (ii) widespread availability of the ICD-10 material for morbidity and mortality coding; (iii) enhanced human and financial resources; and (iv) optimal use of informatics. We describe the methodology of a disease classification and codification system as also its applications for developing and maintaining an effective health information management system for India.",

The study described involved the collection of quantitative data through a national survey. The theoretical significance of this work is that it uses a thoroughly constructed research model, with one of the largest sample sizes ever tested (n=1605), to extend technology acceptance research into the health sector. Results provide strong support for the model. This work reveals the complexity of the constructs and relationships that influence technology acceptance and highlights the need to include sociotechnical and system issues in studies of technology acceptance in healthcare to improve information system implementation success in this arena. The results of this study have practical and theoretical implications for health informaticians and researchers in the field of health informatics and information systems, tertiary educators, Commonwealth and State Governments and the allied health professions.",

    "abstract": "To further improve the department information system, and to establish a multi-parameter critical care medicine database, which can provide data for the analysis and research of big data in critical care medicine, and provide references for other medical institutions to establish relevant databases. On the premise of fully understanding the needs of clinical and scientific research, based on a Critical Care Medicine Clinical Information System, the department of critical care medicine of the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital integrated the patients' case data in hospital information system (HIS), electronic medical records (EMR), monitoring information system (Monitor), laboratory information system (LIS), and radiation information system (RIS), to establish a rudimentary critical care database. On this basis, the related data were analyzed and verified. Further, this database was gradually improved in both its content and structure by referring to Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. During the operation of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Information System from September 2017 to February 2020, the database collected diagnosis and treatment data of 2 207 critically ill patients, including data before the patient entering the intensive care unit (ICU) and all data during the ICU, such as demographic data, vital signs, medical treatment, the records of intake and output, sampling time, laboratory examination results, surgical treatment, and a variety of commonly used clinical scoring and diagnosis data. The data in the database were stored in different tables according to different contents, and the tables were connected to each other through the primary key. The data could be analyzed statistically through the information system and has been applied for certain clinical studies, combining clinical practices with scientific studies. The critical care medicine database based on the Critical Care Medicine Clinical Information System can help medical institutions to carry out standardized treatment and clinical research of critically ill patients. With further improvement of the function, the database can be better applied to the data analysis of Chinese critical patients.",

The scope of this work includes the specifications of flexible, cost-effective approaches, standards, guidelines, methodologies, and related services for interoperability between healthcare information systems. In the field of medical information technologies, HL7 provides the world's most advanced information standards. Versions 1 and 2 of the HL7 standard have on the one hand solved many issues, but on the other demonstrated the size and complexity of the health information sharing problem. As the solution, a complete new methodology has been adopted, which is being encompassed in version 3 recommendations. This approach standardizes the Reference Information Model (RIM), which is the source of all domain models and message structures. Message design is now defined in detail, enabling interoperability between loosely-coupled systems that are designed by different vendors and deployed in various environments. At the start of the Primary Healthcare Information System project, we have decided to go directly to HL7v3. Implementing the HL7v3 standard in healthcare applications represents a challenging task. By using standardized refinement and localization methods we were able to define information models for Croatian primary healthcare domain. The scope of our work includes clinical, financial and administrative data management, where in some cases we were compelled to introduce new HL7v3-compliant models. All of the HL7v3 transactions are digitally signed, using the W3C XML Digital Signature standard.",

    "abstract": "The large and rapidly growing number of information sources relevant to health care, and the increasing amounts of new evidence produced by researchers, are improving the access of professionals and students to valuable information. However, seeking and filtering useful, valid information can be still very difficult. An online information system that conducts searches based on individual patient data can have a beneficial influence on the particular patient's outcome and educate the healthcare worker. In this paper, we describe the underlying model for a system that aims to facilitate the search for evidence based on clinicians' needs. This paper reviews studies of information needs of clinicians, describes principles of information retrieval, and examines the role that standardized terminologies can play in the integration between a clinical system and literature resources, as well as in the information retrieval process. The paper also describes a model for a digital library system that supports the integration of clinical systems with online information sources, making use of information available in the electronic medical record to enhance searches and information retrieval. The model builds on several different, previously developed techniques to identify information themes that are relevant to specific clinical data. Using a framework of evidence-based practice, the system generates well-structured questions with the intent of enhancing information retrieval. We believe that by helping clinicians to pose well-structured clinical queries and including in them relevant information from individual patients' medical records, we can enhance information retrieval and thus can improve patient-care.",

With the rise of the concept of integrated care organizational borders, the sole focus on data aggregation or healthcare professionals as users disappear more and more. The manuscript discusses the concept of CISs and investigates critical success factors for CISs in the context of integrated care and in the course of time. In order to identify critical success factors and barriers for CISs a systematic literature review was conducted based on the results from PubMed and Cochrane, using MaxQDA. Search results were thereby limited to reviews or meta-analysis. We have found 1919 references of which 40 met the inclusion criteria. The analysis of the manuscripts resulted in a comprehensive list of success factors and barriers related to CISs in integrated care settings. Most barriers were user-related whereas for the success factors an even distribution of organizational, technical and user-related factors was observed. The vast majority of publications was focused on healthcare professionals. It is important to incorporate experiences made/ collected over time, as the problems encountered seem to remain almost unvaried. In order to support further systematic investigations on the topic it is necessary to rethink existing concepts and definitions to realign them with the ideas of integrated care.",

To argue about our viewpoint of the dominance of the human component, which has been discussed at an IMIA working conference held in Helsinki, Finland (February 1998) devoted to the evaluation of health information systems. Any technology sets a relationship between human beings and their environment, both physical and human. No technology can be seen as merely instrumental. This is especially relevant when dealing with large automatic information systems, developed to contribute to the management and integration of large organizations, such as hospitals. In such a context, the environment is mainly made up of humans. In evaluating such information systems, human factors preside over merely technical factors. Even if satisfying the latter is mandatory, they are never really sufficient. A perfect hard- and software system can be an absolute failure in everyday use. In any information system, the human factor is, of course, human-computer interaction, which always occurs when one person interacts with the machinery. However, in a simultaneous multi-user context, human-human interaction is the main question to tackle. The evaluation of large information systems, such as those found in hospitals, is founded in the whole concept of inter-human relationships which underlie the design and use of the system. Indeed, such an information system predominately appears as a social system, with its psychological, sociological and ethical features.",

The data collection methods included the following: an evaluation scale of the system function, focus group interviews about the users' experiences, and work sampling observation of their work pattern. The data were collected from October to December 2006. The data analysis contained 623 valid questionnaires, 24 nurses' interview content, and 22830 observed nursing activities. Overall, the results indicated that nurses gave a positive evaluation of the technology in their work routine. However, they were concerned about the inadequacy of the hardware devices and response time, training and workflow change, and personal interactions with physicians and patients. Nurses on the night shift spent more time on documentation than on any other nursing activities during the three shifts. The users' technology adoption could be attributed to device sufficiency and function, content design, and workflow efficiency. It is recommended that organizations provide sufficient computer devices, ensure the content design for nursing documentation, and implement expectations for interdisciplinary cooperation.",

This research evaluates the success of the clinical information system used in the General Hospital \"Asklepieio Voulas\". A questionnaire was developed based on the DeLone & McLean information systems success model, and used on February 2020, to record the users' opinions regarding the information system. The reliability of the questionnaire was tested by applying Cronbach's alpha analysis, descriptive statistics was calculated for all variables of the questionnaire, and new variables was created to investigate the relationships between the model's factors. Correlation analysis between the factors and linear multiple regression analysis between some of the factors of the DeLone & McLean success model were conducted 218 users responded to the survey, 56.3% of them were medical doctors, 24.1% nurses, and 19.6% other staff of the hospital. Results highlight that the users of the system are satisfied with it. A77.3% of the participants believe that they perform their work more easily when using the system, while 89.3% of the participants believe that the system is useful in their work. According to the results of the model, system quality and information quality seems to be related with the system usage. Information quality plays the most important role in the use of the system while the system quality plays the most important role in user satisfaction. Based on the users' opinions, the \"Asklepieio Voulas\" Hospital Information System can be assumed as successful.",

Medical personnel charted and reviewed respiratory care procedures at nursing station computer terminals instead of using the patient's traditional paper chart. The computer automatically performed billing and provided management as well as clinical information. In an attempt to isolate specific benefits or shortcomings, we evaluated charting systems both before and after computer implementation. Four assessments were made: (1) a survey of therapists' attitudes, (2) an observation of work patterns, (3) an audit of the content of charting, and (4) an analysis of productivity statistics. Computer charting was well accepted by therapists. Charge capture was reduced from a four-step manual process to a single-step computer documentation of the procedure. Computer charting was more complete and informative. Productivity increased 18%, although it remains unclear to what degree the computer was responsible. Computer charting streamlined the process of documentation and allowed more beneficial use of clinical information.",

This study used data from the National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS), a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of U.S. NH. Data on current use of EIS in 12 functional areas, including administrative and resident care activities, were collected. Information was also collected on facility characteristics including ownership, bed size, and whether the facility was a member of a chain. Essentially all (99.6%) U.S. NH had >or=1 EIS, a figure that was driven by the nearly universal use of EIS for Minimum Data Set (MDS) reporting (96.4%) and for billing (95.4%). Nearly 43% of U.S. NH had EIS for medical records, including nurse's notes, physician notes, and MDS forms. EIS use ranged from a high of 79.6% for admission, transfer, and discharge to a low of 17.6% for daily care by certified nursing assistants (CNAs). Ownership, membership in a chain, and bed size were associated with use of selected EIS. Larger facilities and those that were part of a chain used more EIS than smaller standalone facilities. In 2004, NH use of EIS for functions other than MDS and billing was highly variable, but considerably higher than previous estimates.",

The instrument of investigation was a questionnaire with 24 questions, distributed to all the independent health institutions in Serbia (total 238). The overall response rate was 40.8%. Of the number of responding health institutions, 92.8% own computers which are in use, six PCs on average, and on average use two application softwares, obligatory one for accounting and billing. In conclusion, health care institutions in the Republic of Serbia are unsatisfactorily equipped with information technology and without the developed institutional information system, except on the level of the project. So, careful planning, selection, implementation and management with national coordination will be needed to ensure the appropriate use of technology and information systems in health care.",

    "abstract": "To analyze results of the Horus Information System, comparing elements of this system with some international experiences. Horus is a technological innovation introduced in 2009 in the Pharmaceutical management information system of the Sistema Único de Saúde (Brazilian Unified Health System). In 2011, local managers and health professionals of 1,247 municipalities (16 states) that adhered to Horus answered questionnaires on pharmaceutical assistance in primary care and about the Horus system. This is a descriptive and exploratory study, developed with the use of quantitative and qualitative methods of research. Multivariate tools were used for data collection and interpretative support of the statistical inference and thematic analysis. The main changes identified after the implementation of this system were: improvement on technical and scientific quality control of Pharmaceutical Assistance, improvement on the supply of medications and health care; training of human resources and knowledge management; improvement on the relationship health managers/users; development in the administrative management and greater inter-state management; and improvement on the technological infrastructure. In terms of health information systems, these categories are consistent with programs and obstacles observed in international experiences. The biggest gap identified was the fact that Horus was not included in a national policy of health information systems, which is in a process of consolidation in Brazil. The national database of actions and services within the Pharmaceutical Assistance will enable the collection, analysis and dissemination of information regarding integrated pharmaceutical assistance in the Brazilian context. The Horus System is a technological innovation that enables the management of the Pharmaceutical Assistance. The national base will enable the definition and agreement on national indicators of Pharmaceutical Assistance, aiming to produce evidence of better health conditions to the users and produce indications about the situation of the National Policy on Pharmaceutical Assistance and its trends.",

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Truly Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for Telecare Medical Information Systems.",
    "abstract": "Significant development of information technologies has made Telecare Medical Information Systems (TMISs) increasingly popular. In a TMIS, patients upload their medical data through smart devices to obtain a doctor's diagnosis. However, these smart devices have limited computing and storage capacities, so it is difficult to store substantial patient information and to support time-consuming operations. Moreover, although many three-factor authentication protocols have been proposed for TMISs, the problems of privacy leaks and other security flaws are serious. In addition, authentication factors are verified at the user side in most protocols, giving users a high level of trust and resulting in a potential lack of security. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient truly three-factor authentication protocol for TMISs. In our proposed protocol, three factors (i.e., password, smart card and biometrics) are verified at the server side, which reduces the storage and computational burden of the user side. Additionally, our proposed protocol uses only lightweight operators and is thus efficient. A formal proof analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol is provably secure in the random oracle model. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol is very efficient and suitable for TMISs.",

    "title": "Meeting information needs: analysis of clinicians' use of an HIV database through an electronic medical record.",
    "abstract": "We developed an on-line medical record (OMR) and integrated it into a mature hospital information system. The OMR provides a number of information resources for the care of patients infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), including drug information, an on-line version of a newsletter on AIDS, an on-line version of a textbook on HIV, and an index of research protocols that actively enrolls patients. As part of an 18-month clinical trial of this system, we monitored the use of the information resources and whether or not the resources were being used at the time of a patient's visit. During 16% of office visits of HIV-infected patients, clinicians viewed some HIV-related information. Forty-four of 70 clinicians looked at drug information (the most popular resource) 347 times (eight times per person). Two thirds of each clinician's use of the information was through a patient's electronic record, and about half of those (or one third of each clinician's use) were at the time of a patient's visit. Use of other information resources was somewhat less, but the proportion of uses during a patient's visit was similar. Because of this high level of use, we conclude that clinicians need information resources at the point of patient care and that the electronic medical record is an ideal medium through which to convey this information to providers.",

By defining 'lots' as the health records for all households with children under 5 years old which were listed on the rosters of village health promoters supervised by a given community health supervisor, and by establishing criteria for 'acceptability' of samples drawn from these lots, we were able to identify and offer additional supervision to health workers (supervisors as well as village health promoters) who were not performing adequately. As LQA sampling procedures require that only a small sample be drawn from each lot, the assessment could be conducted easily and quickly. Health workers were found to have the greatest need for help in updating demographic data and information about home-based oral rehydration therapy (ORT) training sessions, and the least for help in recording children's immunization status. We conclude that LQA can be a useful supervisory tool for health programme managers.",

    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized the need to improve the tracking of medical device safety and performance, with implementation of Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) in electronic health information as a key strategy. The FDA funded a demonstration by Mercy Health wherein prototype UDIs were incorporated into its electronic information systems. This report describes the demonstration's informatics architecture. Prototype UDIs for coronary stents were created and implemented across a series of information systems, resulting in UDI-associated data flow from manufacture through point of use to long-term follow-up, with barcode scanning linking clinical data with UDI-associated device attributes. A reference database containing device attributes and the UDI Research and Surveillance Database (UDIR) containing the linked clinical and device information were created, enabling longitudinal assessment of device performance. The demonstration included many stakeholders: multiple Mercy departments, manufacturers, health system partners, the FDA, professional societies, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, and information system vendors. The resulting system of systems is described in detail, including entities, functions, linkage between the UDIR and proprietary systems using UDIs as the index key, data flow, roles and responsibilities of actors, and the UDIR data model. The demonstration provided proof of concept that UDIs can be incorporated into provider and enterprise electronic information systems and used as the index key to combine device and clinical data in a database useful for device evaluation. Keys to success and challenges to achieving this goal were identified. Fundamental informatics principles were central to accomplishing the system of systems model.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate the creation of a personal medical literature filing system, we developed MEDFILE, a noncomputerized, preprinted medical literature filing system. A graduating medical school class that had access to MEDFILE and a control group of incoming interns were studied to ascertain satisfaction, usage, utility, and implementation of MEDFILE in comparison with traditional literature filing systems. Data were obtained from 52 recent graduates of the site school and 25 graduates of other institutions. MEDFILE users had a significantly higher satisfaction level (7.3 +/- 1.5 vs 4.5 +/- 2.7, p less than .0001, two-tailed t-test), a more extensive filing system (p less than .02, chi square), and greater confidence that their filing system would remain useful during residency (p less than .0001, Fisher's exact test) than new graduates who had created their own filing systems. The data indicate that MEDFILE is an efficient, effective, and inexpensive method of organizing medical reprints. It may be particularly useful for physicians entering primary care disciplines that require information processing over a wide range of clinical topics.",

    "title": "Optimization and Analysis of Intelligent Accounting Information System Based on Deep Learning Model.",
    "abstract": "Accounting information often accounts for more than 70% of an enterprise's financial report information. Accounting information is an important reference for an enterprise to make major decisions, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for an enterprise to remain invincible under the increasingly fierce business competition. With the vigorous development of enterprise informatization, traditional accounting information processing methods can no longer meet the needs of the information age. Therefore, an excellent enterprise must have a complete set of intelligent accounting information systems. How to extract the information we want from the dazzling accounting information data is a hot topic in the current financial industry. On the basis of analyzing the significance of establishing an information system, this paper creates an intelligent recognition model, which solves the shortcomings of traditional methods such as large calculation errors, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. The research results of the article show that (1) the standardized coefficients of the four influencing factors of CSR, ROE, CEO, and SCALE are relatively large, indicating that these four influencing factors have a significant impact on the development of corporate accounting and you can pay attention to these four aspects. (2) To test the performance of the article model, the experiments are compared with other models. The results show that the model proposed in this paper has the highest running success rate on the two test sets, with a success rate of more than 98%, indicating that the model in this paper has certain advantages in accounting information processing. (3) In the page response time experiment, the financial module has the shortest response time, the number of tests is 60 times, the average response time is 0.5 s, and the success rate can reach 100%. It can reach 0.8 s, and the success rate can be kept above 98%, indicating that the system can work normally. In the system operation stability test, the number of test cases designed for the financial module is 70, the number of executed test cases is 70, and the execution rate can reach 100%. This means that the system can work properly and will not fail during operation.",

The health information system in health services in Indonesia has experienced many problems in getting support for policy making, the implementation of the industrial revolution 4.0, and national health insurance (JKN). To answer the above problems, it is necessary to make a concept of health information systems in health services that based on environment and one health perspectives. This research was part of the thematic research of the 2019 JKN National Health Facilities Survey (Rifaskes) in Indonesia. The systems approach and cross-sectional research were carried out by collecting quantitative data. A structural equation model with Lisrel 88 software was used to model the health information system. The health information system produced a concept that included the following structured input components: governance, human resources, infrastructure, types of information system (IS) (program, JKN, management), and financing; process components: funding, technical guidance, and verification and validation; and output components: open access, standards and quality, utilization, bridging, and security. The concept for strengthening the health information system prioritizes improving the output components (standards, utilization, bridging, open access, and security) in the process components (funding, verification, technical guidance) while the input components (financing, human resources, governance, IS programs, infrastructure, IS JKN, IS management).",

    "abstract": "A result-oriented medical information system at the Gulf Oil Corporation is described. Mortality data acquired mostly from routine company operations have been used to calculate standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and life expectancy. Results show that male employees at the age of 20 have a life expectancy of 74.8 years. Compared with the U.S. general population at age 20 with a life expectancy of 71.8 years, Gulf employees have an advantage of exactly three years. Such an advantage may seem small, but it is equivalent to the gain that could be achieved if all deaths from cancer were eliminated in the United States, a hypothetical and impossible situation. These life expectancy data have the potential for use by the company to influence insurance premiums traditionally set by life insurance companies as well as to aid in the management of the company's pension fund. The SMR for all causes for the male employees is 0.82, significantly decreased in comparison with that of the U.S. general population. This favorable experience has been referred to as \"the healthy worker effect.\" Cause-specific SMRs show a generalized pattern of deficits, some of which are statistically significant. None showed a significant increase. Seventy-six percent of the male deaths occurred among employees aged 65 years or older. If these annuitants (those alive at the beginning of the study) were not included and only the active workers were studied, an SMR of only 0.54 would be obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Few performance management information systems are available and features in many are scattered. The purpose of the study was to determine nurse managers' opinions of information system support for performance management. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from nurse managers ( = 419). Pearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression were used to examine the relationships between variables, which were nurse managers' ability to manage resources, to report and evaluate productivity, and to assess nursing performance and clinical procedures. More than half of the managers used performance management systems daily. Managers (60%) felt that they can use information systems to follow the use of physical resources, and in general (63%), they felt that it is easy to perform searches with the systems used for following up activity. Nurse managers' ability to manage resources, to report productivity, and to assess nursing care performance were correlated significantly with each other. Currently, managers have to collect data from various systems for management purposes, as system integration does not support performance data collection. The availability of continuous in-service training had a positive effect on information system use.",

    "title": "Challenges and opportunities for effective adoption of HRH information systems in developing countries: national rollout of HRHIS and TIIS in Tanzania.",
    "abstract": "The establishment of a functional information system for human resource for health (HRH) was one of the major challenges for the Tanzanian health sector. In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare developed the HRH Strategic Plan, in which establishment of computerized information systems were one of the strategic objectives. In response to this objective, the Ministry developed two information systems, namely the Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS) and the Training Institution Information System (TIIS), to capture information from both the public and private sectors. The national rollout of HRHIS and TIIS was carried out in four phases during a 6 year period between 2009 and 2014. Together with other activities, the rollout process included conducting system operation training and data utilization training for evidence-based planning, development and management of HRH and social welfare workers and health training institutions. HRHIS was rolled out in all 25 regions of the Tanzanian mainland, including 171 districts, and TIIS was rolled out in all 154 health training institutions and universities. Information is captured from both the private and public health sectors with high-data coverage. The authors identified several key factors for the achievements such as using local experts for developing the systems, involvement of system users, positive attitudes among users, focusing on routine work of the system users and provision of operations and data utilization trainings. However, several challenges were also identified such as getting a consensus on sustainable HR information systems among stakeholders, difficulty in obtaining baseline HRH information, inadequate computer skills and unsatisfactory infrastructure for information and communication technology. We learned that detailed situation analysis and understanding of the reality on the ground helped to reduce the \"design-reality gap\" and contributed to establishing user-friendly systems and to improve sustainability of the systems. This paper illustrates the successful development and national rollout of two information systems for HRH in Tanzania. The approaches used and activities conducted here and lessons learned could be useful for countries which are planning to establish HR information systems.",

The data is stored in the hospital database and can be accessed from anywhere through the internet. When a patient is in an alarming situation, the VI sends SMS messages to the mobile of the designated health personnel via the public GSM network. The novelty of the system lies in its security and its ability to use both the internet and the GSM network as communication media. Doctors can access the database server to compare the patient's current status with his/her medical history. It can be used by one physician to monitor a group of patients simultaneously, or by a group of physicians who all monitor the same patient. It allows plug-and-play of multivendor off-the-shelf hardware devices, thus avoiding proprietary standards.",

Key factors for changing physicians' practice habits are the availability of more powerful methods and tools for interactive data acquisition and retrieval. Problems involving human engineering usually require the identification of and experimentation with many novel approaches before the most suitable answer is discovered. ARPIA is an ambulatory information system experimenting on the effectiveness and acceptability (by medical users) of new intelligent and friendly interaction techniques and tools. In particular, it tests a novel flexible dialogue-based man-machine interface offering physical and logical data 'independence' during retrieval operations. Other features of the system are: a fast and robust data acquisition environment; a text- and picture-based data presentation and report generation facility; finally, a set of modules offering the ambulatory staff effective assistance in some extra complex interactive tasks. A user-oriented description of the main functionality of ARPIA is given; users' feedback summarizing almost 2 years of usage of the system is also reported.",

    "abstract": "The toxicologic problems of today frequently require long-term, multidisciplinary experimentation involving large numbers of animals. In order to provide the extensive safety evaluation necessary to produce data that can be reasonably extrapolated to humans, automated research support systems have transcended the position of useful tools and have become an integral part of the total design of experimental protocols. For an automated information system to fully represent the reality of the experiment, it must be able to assure integrity, as well as provide for the storage, calculation, and retrieval of data values of the quality and quantity necessary for fulfilling protocol requirements. Guarantees against error and loss of data, in addition to flexibility and easy access, must be an inherent part of the system if the acceptance and condifence of the investigator are to be obtained. This paper discusses the criteria, philosophies, and benefits of integrated data systems that ensure integrity of toxicologic research support.",

    "abstract": "Hospitals are convenient settings for deployment of ubiquitous computing technology. Not only are they technology-rich environments, but their workers experience a high level of mobility resulting in information infrastructures with artifacts distributed throughout the premises. Hospital information systems (HISs) that provide access to electronic patient records are a step in the direction of providing accurate and timely information to hospital staff in support of adequate decision-making. This has motivated the introduction of mobile computing technology in hospitals based on designs which respond to their particular conditions and demands. Among those conditions is the fact that worker mobility does not exclude the need for having shared information artifacts particular locations. In this paper, we extend a handheld-based mobile HIS with ubiquitous computing technology and describe how public displays are integrated with handheld and the services offered by these devices. Public displays become aware of the presence of physicians and nurses in their vicinity and adapt to provide users with personalized, relevant information. An agent-based architecture allows the integration of proactive components that offer information relevant to the case at hand, either from medical guidelines or previous similar cases.",

The incorporation of Evidence-Based Medicine offers numerous benefits and enhances the efficacy of decision-making in areas such as prevention, prognosis, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches. The objective of this paper is to propose an architectural design of an Evidence-Based Medicine information system based on the Electronic Health Record, taking into account the existing and future level of interoperability of health information systems in Greece. A study of the suggested evidence-based medicine architectures found in the existing literature was conducted. Moreover, the interoperability architecture of health information systems in Greece was analyzed. The architecture design reviewed by specialized personnel and their recommendations were incorporated into the final design of the proposed architecture. The proposed integrated architecture of an Evidence-Based Medicine system based on the Electronic Health Record integrates and utilizes citizens' health data while leveraging the existing knowledge available in the literature. Taking into consideration the recently established National Interoperability Framework, which aligns with the European Interoperability Framework, the proposed realistic architectural approach contributes to improving the quality of healthcare provided through the ability to make safe, timely and accurate decisions by physicians.",

    "title": "Rethinking medical professionalism: the role of information technology and practice innovations.",
    "abstract": "Physician leaders and the public have become increasingly concerned about the erosion of medical professionalism. Changes in the organization, economics, and technology of medical care have made it difficult to maintain competence, meet patients' expectations, escape serious conflicts of interest, and distribute finite resources fairly. Information technology (IT), electronic health records (EHRs), improved models of disease management, and new ways of relating to and sharing responsibility for patients' care can contribute to both professionalism and quality of care. The potential of IT, EHRs, and other practice facilitators for professionalism is assessed through diverse but relevant literatures, examination of relevant websites, and experience in working with medical leaders on renewing professionalism. IT and EHRs are the basis of needed efforts to reinforce medical competence, improve relationships with patients, implement disease management programs, and, by increasing transparency and accountability, help reduce some conflicts of interest. Barriers include the misalignment of goals with payment incentives and time pressures in meeting patients' expectations and practice demands. Implementing IT and EHRs in small, dispersed medical practices is particularly challenging because of short-term financial costs, disruptions in practice caused by learning and adaptation, and the lack of confidence in needed support services. Large organized systems like the VA, Kaiser Permanente, and general practice in the United Kingdom have successfully overcome such challenges. IT and the other tools examined in this article are important adjuncts to professional capacities and aspirations. They have potential to help reverse the decline of primary care and make physicians' practices more effective and rewarding. The cooperation, collaboration, and shared responsibility of government, insurers, medical organizations, and physicians, as well as financial and technical support, are needed to implement these tools in the United States' dispersed and fragmented medical care system.",

    "title": "Development and implementation of a secure, integrated management system for medical images and electronic clinical records for small hospitals.",
    "abstract": "The field of Medical Informatics is currently experiencing increasing demands for new models of the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) protocols. Despite of the considerable advantages of current systems, implementation in hospitals is remarkably slow, due primarily to difficulties in integration and relatively high costs. Even though the success of DICOM standards has greatly contributed to the development of PACS, many hospitals remain unable to support it or to make full use of its potential because various imaging modalities in use at these sites generate images that cannot be stored in the PACS and cannot be managed in a centralized manner without DICOM standardization modules. Furthermore, the imaging modalities being used in such smaller centers are expensive and unlikely to be replaced, making DICOM compliance untenable. With this in mind, this paper describes the design, development, and implementation of a management system for medical diagnostic imaging, based on the DICOM standard and adapted to the needs of a small hospital. The system is currently being implemented in the San Rafael Hospital at A Coruna in Spain, and integrated with the existing hospital information system (HIS). We have studied the networking infrastructure of the hospital and its available image generation devices, and have subsequently carried out a series of measurements including transmission times, image file size, compression ratios, and many others that allow us to analyze the behavior of the system. Results obtained from these investigations demonstrate both the flexibility of using such a \"small-hospital\" DICOM-based framework as well as the relative cost-effectiveness of the system. In this regard, the approach, described herein, might serve as a model for other small, and possibly mid-sized, medical centers.",

    "abstract": "Many existing training programs for Health Information Systems (HIS) do not adequately satisfy end users' needs nor meet training objectives. This is because they do not envisage the problems that users may encounter when performing specific tasks. Therefore the first priority for the development of an effective training program is to precisely assess the end users' training needs, a process called Training Needs Assessment (TNA). Applying traditional approaches for TNA, such as interviews or surveys alone, however, may be insufficient because they are limited in their capacity to reveal the cognitive processes of end users. Usability testing, with its ability to gather data about human computer interaction, overcomes the deficiencies of these traditional approaches. This paper proposes a multi-method approach, which combines usability testing together with traditional methods, such as interviews or questionnaire surveys to assess HIS end users' training needs. This innovative method is able to precisely reveal the training needs for different levels of HIS users. A case study, which applied this method to assess the training needs for users of a nursing information system demonstrates its feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Runaway and homeless youth face multiple challenges to their health and experience inadequate access to health care services. This article describes a web-based personal health information system (PHIS) called Healthshack that was specifically designed to improve health care access and health outcomes for runaway and homeless youth at a community-based agency that served homeless youth and young adults up to age 24. The program was developed in partnership with homeless youth and piloted by public health nurses. Preliminary findings from the program indicate that a PHIS is acceptable to runaway and homeless youth and feasible to incorporate into the flow of a youth agency. Thus, a PHIS may be an innovative model of service delivery for other marginalized populations.",

The health information system (HIS) integrates data collection, processing, reporting, and use of the information useful to measure and assess health and social care for improving their management. HIS has great potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes. Information may be used to plan community-based care interventions by identifying populations at risk, especially by community healthcare professionals (e.g., family/community nurses). In Italy, HIS collects health and social information of individuals cared by the National Health Service. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to provide an overview of the main existing health and social HIS Italian databases; (ii) to describe the experiences of use of the information of HIS databases in the Piedmont Region.",

The objects inside a museum share the information that assist and navigate the visitors about the different sections and objects of the museum. The system was deployed inside Chakdara Museum and experimented with 381 users to achieve the results. For results, different users marked the proposed system in terms of parameters such as interesting, reality, ease of use, satisfaction, usefulness, and user friendly. Of these 381 users, 201 marked the system as most interesting, 138 marked most realistic, 121 marked it as easy-in-use, 219 marked it useful, and 210 marked it as user friendly. These statistics prove the efficiency of SNIS and its usefulness in smart cultural heritage, including smart museums, exhibitions and cultural sites.",

Four dimensions covering 12 factors and 149 indicators were identified. The first dimension, data collection management, includes data collection system and quality assurance. The second dimension, data collector, is described by staffing pattern, skill or competence, communication and attitude toward data collection. The third, information system, is assessed by function and technology support, integration of different data collection systems, and device. The fourth dimension, data collection environment, comprises training, leadership, and funding. With empirical testing and contextual analysis, these essential components can be further used to develop a framework for measuring the quality of the data collection process for public health information systems.",

Vaccine hesitancy (VH) is due to several factors that influence the complex decision-making process. Information technology tools might play an important role in vaccination programs. In particular, immunization information systems (IISs) have the potential to improve performance of vaccination programs and to increase vaccine uptake. This review aimed to present IIS functionalities in order to counter VH. In detail, we analyzed the automatic reminder/recall system, the interoperability of the system, the decision support system, the web page interface and the possibility to record adverse events following immunization. IIS could concretely represent a valid instrument to increase vaccine confidence, especially trust in both health-care workers and decision makers. There are not enough trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of IIS to counter VH. Further researches might focalize on this aspect.",

We selected 24 maternity hospitals in the Unified National Health System (SUS) and compared the reports of birth defects from birth certificates with medical records of mothers and live born infants in the city of Rio de Janeiro for the year 2004. After transposing the data to a specific form, the birth defects were coded by types and organ systems and compared to the SINASC data. The most commonly affected organs involved the central nervous and musculoskeletal systems. Agreement was more than 50% for the digestive, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and chromosomal anomalies. Prevalence-adjusted kappa varied according to 2 or 3-digit ICD-10 analysis, with better results for the musculoskeletal, digestive, and genitourinary systems and congenital anomalies, and worse for the central nervous and cardio-circulatory systems, eye, neck, and ear malformations, and cleft lip and palate.

    "abstract": "In contemporary society, customer-centered health care, which stresses customer participation and long-term tailored care, is inevitably becoming a trend. Compared with the hospital or physician-centered healthcare process, the customer-centered healthcare process requires more knowledge and modeling such a process is extremely complex. Thus, building a care process model for a special customer is cost prohibitive. In addition, during the execution of a care process model, the information system should have flexibility to modify the model so that it adapts to changes in the healthcare process. Therefore, supporting the process in a flexible, cost-effective way is a key challenge for information technology. To meet this challenge, first, we analyze various kinds of knowledge used in process modeling, illustrate their characteristics, and detail their roles and effects in careflow modeling. Secondly, we propose a methodology to manage a lifecycle of the healthcare process modeling, with which models could be built gradually with convenience and efficiency. In this lifecycle, different levels of process models are established based on the kinds of knowledge involved, and the diffusion strategy of these process models is designed. Thirdly, architecture and prototype of the system supporting the process modeling and its lifecycle are given. This careflow system also considers the compatibility of legacy systems and authority problems. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate implementation of the careflow system.",

The quality of the record of possible causal relationship between accidents and the work <acidtrab>, a field that appears on death certificates and is exclusive to accidents among external causes, was analyzed with two variables: (1) record \"ignored\" (R-IGN, yes/no); (2) missing or inconsistent records (R-AUS, yes/no). A total of 665,531 deaths were located, of which 67.7% of the <acidtrab> records showed poor quality. Factors associated with record \"ignored\" were: male sex; white skin color; schooling less than university; non-blue-collar workers or non-farmers; death certificate issued by the Forensic Medical Office (IML); Southeast and Northeast regions of the country; and death in hospital. Missing or inconsistent records were associated with: age greater than 34 years; non-white skin color; no schooling; all regions of Brazil except the Southeast; death in hospital or at home; police report as the source of information; and death certificate issued by the IML. The factors independently associated with poor quality of completion of the field <acidtrab> included individual dimensions, source issuing the death certificate, place of death, and geographic variables. The findings reveal the need to improve the quality of death records in hospitals, the IML, and police reports, besides training and supervising teams throughout Brazil.",

Thus, the contact between piedmont and plain units is represented, in many cases, by areas where limits are hard to be drawn. In order to establish the way geographic information system (GIS) may contribute to the determination of the aforementioned limits, we used the situation of the limit between the Getic Piedmont and the Romanian plain and compared the obtained results to examples from other areas with different formation and evolution conditions. Presently, the Getic Piedmont undergoes a modelling process as valleys widen, torrential enlargements laterally advance, and slope denudation develop, which make difficult to establish a clear southern limit. The fan texture of the valleys, their age, the flowing direction, as well as the differences of altitude, lithology, and structure disposal represent the main elements when establishing limits even in the case of GIS analysis. The drawing of thematic layers rendering elements such as hydrographic system, hypsometry, DEM on a traditional cartographic support, orthophotoplans, satellite images, for a better interpretation of the geomorphologic aspects allow a more objective attempt of reconstructing the morphological limits.",

Forty two general practitioners in 15 practices, with a patient population of 80,000 people, are using a general practice health information system to establish a central computerized anonymous database containing certain patient characteristics and all relevant health problems. By September 1990 patient characteristics and problem lists for 32,972 patients had been entered and a total of 94,476 health problems had been identified. The database has been set up primarily as a sampling frame, allowing researchers to identify patients with particular health problems.

    "abstract": "Demographic data extracted from discharge summaries by natural language processing was compared to data gathered by a conventional hospital admitting system. Discrepancies in data were noted in names, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Some differences are attributable to errors in collection: interaction with patient, dictation, transcription, and data entry. Very few differences were due to errors in natural language processing. Other differences can be used to critique existing data, or to enhance data with more detailed information. Discrepancies in data as elementary as patient demographics raise the issue of resolving conflicts when neither source of data is known to be more reliable. Clinical repositories can represent conflicting data from multiple sources, but clinical information systems must bear the cost of increased complexity in the application programs that will use the data.",

    "title": "The QUEST system for quantitative analysis of two-dimensional gels.",
    "abstract": "The strategies and methods used by the QUEST system for two-dimensional gel analysis are described, and the performance of the system is evaluated. Radiolabeled proteins, resolved on two-dimensional gels and detected using calibrated exposures to film, are quantified in units of disintegrations per minute or as a fraction of the total protein radioactivity applied to the gel. Spot quantitation and resolution of overlapping spots is performed by two-dimensional gaussian fitting. Pattern matching is carried out for groups of gels called matchsets, and within each matchset every gel is matched to every other gel. During the matching process, spots are automatically added to each pattern at positions where unmatched spots were detected in other patterns. This results in enhanced accuracy for both spot detection and for matching. The spot fitting procedure is repeated after matching. Tests show that up to 97% of spots in each pattern can be matched and that fewer than 1% of the spots are matched inconsistently. Approximately 2000 proteins are detected from typical gels. Of these 1600 are high quality spots. Tests to measure the coefficient of variation of spot quantitation versus spot quality show that the average coefficient of variation for high quality spots is 21%. The intensities of the detected proteins range from 4 to 20,000 ppm of total protein synthesis. The QUEST analysis system has been used to build a quantitative database for the proteins of normal and transformed REF52 cells, as presented in the accompanying reports (Garrels, J., and Franza, B. R., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5283-5298, 5299-5312).",

    "abstract": "The implementation of information technology in healthcare is a significant focus for many nations around the world. However, information technology support for clinical care, research and education in oral medicine is currently poorly developed. This situation hampers our ability to transform oral medicine into a 'learning healthcare discipline' in which the divide between clinical practice and research is diminished and, ultimately, eliminated. This paper reviews the needs of and requirements for information technology support of oral medicine and proposes an agenda designed to meet those needs. For oral medicine, this agenda includes analyzing and reviewing current clinical and documentation practices, working toward progressively standardizing clinical data, and helping define requirements for oral medicine systems. IT professionals can contribute by conducting baseline studies about the use of electronic systems, helping develop controlled vocabularies and ontologies, and designing, implementing, and evaluating novel systems centered on the needs of clinicians, researchers and educators. Successfully advancing IT support for oral medicine will require close coordination and collaboration among oral medicine professionals, information technology professionals, system vendors, and funding agencies. If current barriers and obstacles are overcome, practice and research in oral medicine stand ready to derive significant benefits from the application of information technology.",

High quality data are essential for evidence-based decision-making to support successful NIPs. Consistent recording and reporting practices, optimal access to and use of health information systems, and rigorous interpretation and use of data for decision-making are characteristics of high-quality immunization information systems. In 2015 and 2016, immunization information system assessments (IISAs) were conducted in Kenya and Ghana using a new WHO and CDC assessment methodology designed to identify root causes of immunization data quality problems and facilitate development of plans for improvement. Data quality challenges common to both countries included low confidence in facility-level target population data (Kenya = 50%, Ghana = 53%) and poor data concordance between child registers and facility tally sheets (Kenya = 0%, Ghana = 3%). In Kenya, systemic challenges included limited supportive supervision and lack of resources to access electronic reporting systems; in Ghana, challenges included a poorly defined subdistrict administrative level. Data quality improvement plans (DQIPs) based on assessment findings are being implemented in both countries. IISAs can help countries identify and address root causes of poor immunization data to provide a stronger evidence base for future investments in immunization programs.",

In a deployment phase of 3 years in a 1.200 bed university hospital, where the system underwent significant improvements, the system's functionality and its software design have been analyzed in detail. We focus on an integrated CASE tool for generating embedded clinical applications and for incremental system evolution. We present a participatory and iterative software engineering process developed for efficient utilization of such a tool. The system's functionality is comparable to other commercial products' functionality; its components are embedded in a vendor-specific application framework, and standard interfaces are being used for connecting subsystems. The integrated generator tool is a remarkable feature; it became a key factor of our project. Tool generated applications are workflow enabled and embedded into the overall data base schema. Rapid prototyping and iterative refinement are supported, so application modules can be adapted to the users' work practice. We consider tools supporting an iterative and participatory software engineering process highly relevant for health information system architects. The potential of a system to continuously evolve and to be effectively adapted to changing needs may be more important than sophisticated but hard-coded HIS functionality. More work will focus on HIS software design and on software engineering. Methods and tools are needed for quick and robust adaptation of systems to health care processes and changing requirements.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is in many cases the first sign of dementia and affects an increasing number of older adults worldwide. Early detection and intervention through cognitive assessment, training, and rehabilitation may assist MCI patients to maintain or even improve their cognitive function. In particular, it is necessary to regularly assess the cognitive status of people with MCI, due to the uncertain course of the impairment. Technological improvements in the field of mobile devices and the development of specialized applications offer the provision of new forms of cognitive training and new methods for the cognitive evaluation of healthy older adults or people with MCI. Through user-friendly and attractive applications, it is attempted to provide pleasant and easy-to-use cognitive interventions, which aim to engage the users. These specialized applications provide the possibility of long-term, remote, and autonomous monitoring of the cognitive status of users, and in combination with the sensors integrated into mobile devices, they offer clinicians new data streams and the possibility of timely and personalized intervention.This chapter presents an overview of existing mobile applications for cognitive evaluation, training, and enhancement. Also, the design of an information system that aims to support memory training and cognitive enhancement is described. This information system is targeting adults with or without cognitive impairment, who wish to maintain or enhance their cognitive status, utilizing the potential and prospects of mobile digital technology. Finally, the cognitive tasks that were selected to be implemented in this information system are presented.",

Little of the information required from RCFEs is computerized. Most of it is maintained at the individual facility and not included in public files. Basic information, while included in the public file, is commonly either not available or not current. Resident characteristics and outcomes are not compiled, except indirectly in citations.

With information on the context of clinical records, methods must integrate controlled biomedical terminologies and desirable characteristics oriented to the structure, content and clinical results. The objective is to test the applicability and capacity for retrieval of a multidimensional system developed for classification and management of health information. Three hundred questions were randomly selected, by computerized method, from the questions received in six years (Medicine Information Service, Pharmaceutical Department, Coimbra University Hospitals). They were characterized and applicability evaluated by classified amount and need to alter the system, which is composed of various independent dimensions, incorporating concepts sometimes hierarchical. Questions retrieval was tested searching information in a dimension or between dimensions. All questions were classified: 53% are clinical cases with illnesses incidence in the genitourinary system; metabolic, nutritional and endocrine disease; cancer; infections and nervous system. In 81%, the object is a drug, mostly anti-infectious and anti-neoplastic agents. The therapeutic and safety areas had been the most requested, regarding the subjects: use, adverse reactions, drug identification and pharmaceutical technology. As to applicability, it was necessary to add some concepts and modify same hierarchical groups, that didn't modify the basic structure, nor had collided with the desirable characteristics. The limitations were related with the incorporated external classification systems. The search in the subject dimension of the concept drug administration retrieved 19 questions. The search between two dimensions: antiinfectious (external) and teratogenicity (subject) retrieved three questions. In the two examples, it was possible to retrieve information from any one of the levels of the hierarchy, from the most general to the most specific and even from external dimensions. The use of the system in this sample showed its applicability in clinical information classification and filing, retrieval capacity and flexibility, supporting modifications without interfering with desirable characteristics. This tool allows retrieval of patient-oriented evidence that matters.",

The paper chart still contains the bulk of information but the key facts about any given patient (diagnoses, surgeries, medications, allergies) and about the process of care (frequency of visits, referral patterns, test ordering, etc.) are readily available in electronic form. These key data are easily coded, are quickly and simultaneously accessible in multiple locations, serve as an excellent chart substitute whenever the paper chart is unavailable, and can be retrieved for in-depth analysis at any time, whether for clinical, administrative, research, or quality assurance purposes. The process of care can be studied and, to some extent, can also be modified by the system, as demonstrated by the physician response to the reminder system within PCHIS. The medical record chart summary, mandated by Joint Commission for ambulatory patient charts, is easily provided in hard copy as well as electronically. Whereas physician compliance in providing data to the system was initially sporadic, physician support has increased tremendously as the system has become more clinically useful to them. It is a system that exists and functions well within a patchwork of multiple different medical information systems. It is a system with sufficient intrinsic flexibility that it can and will continue to evolve in response to the needs of physicians and administrators.",

    "title": "Wisconsin's environmental public health tracking network: information systems design for childhood cancer surveillance.",
    "abstract": "In this article we describe the development of an information system for environmental childhood cancer surveillance. The Wisconsin Cancer Registry annually receives more than 25,000 incident case reports. Approximately 269 cases per year involve children. Over time, there has been considerable community interest in understanding the role the environment plays as a cause of these cancer cases. Wisconsin's Public Health Information Network (WI-PHIN) is a robust web portal integrating both Health Alert Network and National Electronic Disease Surveillance System components. WI-PHIN is the information technology platform for all public health surveillance programs. Functions include the secure, automated exchange of cancer case data between public health-based and hospital-based cancer registrars; web-based supplemental data entry for environmental exposure confirmation and hypothesis testing; automated data analysis, visualization, and exposure-outcome record linkage; directories of public health and clinical personnel for role-based access control of sensitive surveillance information; public health information dissemination and alerting; and information technology security and critical infrastructure protection. For hypothesis generation, cancer case data are sent electronically to WI-PHIN and populate the integrated data repository. Environmental data are linked and the exposure-disease relationships are explored using statistical tools for ecologic exposure risk assessment. For hypothesis testing, case-control interviews collect exposure histories, including parental employment and residential histories. This information technology approach can thus serve as the basis for building a comprehensive system to assess environmental cancer etiology.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare analytics has been a rapidly emerging research domain in recent years. In general, healthcare solution design studies focus on developing analytic solutions that enhance product, process and practice values for clinical and non-clinical decision support. The objective of this study is to explore the scope of healthcare analytics research and in particular its utilisation of design and development methodologies. Using six prominent electronic databases, qualifying articles between 2010 and mid-2018 were sourced and categorised. A total of 52 articles on healthcare analytics solutions were selected for relevant content on public healthcare. The research team scrutinised the articles, using established content analysis protocols. Analysis identified that various methodologies have been used for developing analytics solutions, such as prototyping, traditional software engineering, agile approaches and others, but despite its clear advantages, few show the use of design science. Key topic areas are also identified throughout the content analysis suggesting topical research priorities in the field.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the impact of a decision support system on the quality of recorded diagnoses and the completeness of medical records. The assumption is that for quality assessment purposes enough data have to be recorded in an electronic medical record so that diagnostic decisions can be justified. The hypotheses were tested that active decision support will lead to better quality recorded diagnoses and more complete medical records. Three groups of ten GPs were presented with 10 cases each. The GPs had to enter the data about these cases in a GP information system. One group of GPs was not supported. The second group was presented with the ICHPPC-II-Defined criteria that had to be fulfilled when a diagnosis was entered. In a third group, the GPs were asked those data that were needed to justify an entered diagnosis (active support). It could be shown that the last group of GPs entered better quality diagnoses than the other two groups. These latter groups also entered so little data that most of their diagnoses could not be justified. It is concluded from the study that only active decision support will lead to better diagnoses and a more complete medical record that can be used for quality assessment.",

Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and EBSCO Education Resources Information Center were searched to identify relevant papers. Relevant studies were systematically reviewed and analyzed using a qualitative thematic analysis approach. Of the 3539 studies screened, 17 were included for data extraction. The literature on the most effective approaches to enable health care providers to optimally use an HIS emphasized the importance of investing in engaging and understanding learners in the clinical context, maximizing the transfer of learning to care, and designing continuous and agile evaluation to meet the emerging demands of the clinical environment. This review supports the advancement of a new HIS learning framework that organizational leaders and educators can use to guide HIS education design and development.

The second generation of the World Wide Web (Web 2.0) enables the collaboration and sharing of online information through Web-serving applications. Data mashup, which is considered a Web 2.0 platform, plays an important role in information and communication technology applications. However, few ideas have been transformed into education and research domains, particularly in medical informatics. The creation of a friendly environment for medical informatics research requires the removal of certain obstacles in terms of search time, resource credibility, and search result accuracy. This paper considers three glitches that researchers encounter in medical informatics research; these glitches include the quality of papers obtained from scientific search engines (particularly, Web of Science and Science Direct), the quality of articles from the indices of these search engines, and the customizability and flexibility of these search engines. A customizable search engine for trusted resources of medical informatics was developed and implemented through data mashup. Results show that the proposed search engine improves the usability of scientific search engines for medical informatics. Pipe search engine was found to be more efficient than other engines.",

Mary Dixon-Woods described two types of discourse in patient education: the first is more concerned with making patients comply with their doctors orders and the second is about empowering patients and rejecting direction. This article looks at the aims of the two and shows that neither is capable of supporting highly successful best practice within medicine. Instead, a hybrid set of strategic aims are proposed for patient education created by merging the two discourses in the same way that John Dewey merged the child-centred and child-led schools of thought in education. These hybrid strategic aims for patient education are then used to develop requirements for an information system to support patient education, using a mixture of system centric and user centric approaches.",

This study aims to evaluate the usage of the Turkish translation of Minimal Standard Terminology by developing an endoscopic information system. After elicitation of requirements, database modeling and software development were performed. Minimal Standard Terminology driven forms were designed for rapid data entry. The endoscopic report was rapidly created by applying basic Turkish syntax and grammar rules. Entering free text and also editing of final report were possible. After three years of live usage, data analysis was performed and results were evaluated. The system has been used for reporting of all endoscopic examinations. 15,638 valid records were analyzed, including 11,381 esophagogastroduodenoscopies, 2,616 colonoscopies, 1,079 rectoscopies and 562 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies. In accordance with other previous validation studies, the overall usage of Minimal Standard Terminology terms was very high: 85% for examination characteristics, 94% for endoscopic findings and 94% for endoscopic diagnoses. Some new terms, attributes and allowed values were also added for better clinical coverage. Minimal Standard Terminology has been shown to cover a high proportion of routine endoscopy reports. Good user acceptance proves that both the terms and structure of Minimal Standard Terminology were consistent with usual clinical thinking. However, future work on Minimal Standard Terminology is mandatory for better coverage of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies examinations. Technically new software development methodologies have to be sought for lowering cost of development and the maintenance phase. They should also address integration and interoperability of disparate information systems.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in the management of the complex medical data, obstructs the attainment of data level interoperability among Health Information Systems (HIS). This diversity is dependent on the compliance of HISs with different healthcare standards. Its solution demands a mediation system for the accurate interpretation of data in different heterogeneous formats for achieving data interoperability. We propose an adaptive AdapteR Interoperability ENgine mediation system called ARIEN, that arbitrates between HISs compliant to different healthcare standards for accurate and seamless information exchange to achieve data interoperability. ARIEN stores the semantic mapping information between different standards in the Mediation Bridge Ontology (MBO) using ontology matching techniques. These mappings are provided by our System for Parallel Heterogeneity (SPHeRe) matching system and Personalized-Detailed Clinical Model (P-DCM) approach to guarantee accuracy of mappings. The realization of the effectiveness of the mappings stored in the MBO is evaluation of the accuracy in transformation process among different standard formats. We evaluated our proposed system with the transformation process of medical records between Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standards. The transformation process achieved over 90 % of accuracy level in conversion process between CDA and vMR standards using pattern oriented approach from the MBO. The proposed mediation system improves the overall communication process between HISs. It provides an accurate and seamless medical information exchange to ensure data interoperability and timely healthcare services to patients.",

Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated. Starting from the entities defined in Part 3 of the DICOM standard, we explored how the classes defined there can be integrated into a common data model of the electronic patient record implemented by the HIS (Hospital Information System). Based on the IODs we investigated the definitions and semantics of entities being relevant for structured recording of image data. Because semantic definitions are incomplete, a proposal is made for the core domain of structured radiologic service recording. Its definition of semantics goes beyond the application domain of radiologic imaging to avoid structural conflicts during HIS/RIS/PACS integration. Differentiation between treatment and billing provides an independent temporal mapping of services concerning medical and billing aspects. Two groups of radiologic services are distinguished: radiologic imaging and additional services. The incomplete definition of IOD semantics leads to potential conflicts during system integration. Complete covering of this topic is necessary for implementation of the electronic patient record.",

This paper presents a four-stage approach to optimise a biorefinery supply chain for Ireland's agricultural waste sector. The spatial availability of agricultural waste was assessed, followed by evaluating land suitability for biorefinery development under economic, environmental, and social constraints. A hybrid method using GIS and AHP was employed to rank suitable areas, and a mathematical model was used for supply chain optimisation. Results showed only 12 % of the study area is highly suitable for biorefineries, with an average transportation distance of 39 km, leading to reduced costs and emissions. The framework's efficiency is highlighted by a transportation cost of only 4 %, compared to 16 % in previous studies. This research fills a gap in bioenergy supply chain management by demonstrating advanced tools for optimising sustainability and site suitability.",

Death records containing ICD-10 C32X codes were retrieved from SIM and SIH-SUS, limited to individuals aged 30 years and over, between 2002 and 2012, in the state of São Paulo. The databases were linked using a unique key identifier developed with sociodemographic data shared by both systems. Linkage performance was ascertained by applying the same procedure to similar non-anonymous databases. True pairs were those having the same identification variables. A total of 14,311 eligible death records were found. Most records, 10,674 (74.6%), were exclusive to SIM. Only 1,853 (12.9%) deaths were registered in both systems, representing true pairs. A total of 1,784 (12.5%) cases of laryngeal cancer in the SIH-SUS database were tracked in SIM with different causes of death. The linkage failed to match 167 (9.4%) records due to inconsistencies in the key identifier.

    "title": "Genetic counselors, patients', and carers' views on an Australian clinical genetics service information system.",
    "abstract": "The Genetic Information System (GIS) is an Australian database of family genetic information. This health information technology system has been used by all 31 publicly operated clinical genetics services across New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) for over a decade. As these services are separated geographically, the linkage engendered by the GIS facilitates the services to operate as a virtual state-wide service. This study aimed to explore the views of genetic counselors, patients, and carers on the use and storage of family genetic information in the GIS. Data were collected using audio-recorded semi-structured telephone interviews with genetic counselors experienced with using the GIS and focus groups with past patients/carers of the services. Using thematic analysis, four themes were identified from genetic counselor participant interviews (n = 12): (a) Shared information is valuable; (b) inconsistent data entry provides a challenge; (c) perceived need for the GIS to be current and integrated with other health systems; and (d) future challenges and strategies for the GIS. Three themes were identified following three focus groups with consumer participants (n = 14): (a) access to family genetic information provides a 'clearer picture'; (b) support, but caution, concerning use of information for relatives' health care; and (c) stewardship of family information. Genetic counselors and consumers identified similar advantages and privacy concerns regarding the sharing of family genetic information and all participants wanted patients/carers to be better informed about the GIS early in the genetic counseling process. Consumers were reassured by genetics health professionals' stewardship of their information, but surprised the GIS was not available nationally or for private geneticists or certain non-genetic specialists. These findings may inform further development of the GIS and other clinical genetic databases and lead to increased patient/carer knowledge through education and resource development.",

Urban regeneration, which is an important agenda for both academia and politicians, aims to address these urban problems which are mostly caused by overpopulation. As the urban regeneration is a complex issue that requires to consider numerous components, regeneration initiatives cannot always achieve sustainable urban applications, which are causing new urban and social problems. Previous research have mainly focused on one aspect of urban renewal, in which a comprehensive perspective is lacking by just considering the physical aspects of the regeneration areas while lacking the social aspects and current global issues such as climate change and urban adaptation. A multi-criteria decision-making process for site selection and sustainable regeneration plan would contribute to better regeneration outcomes. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making process which combines the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical ınformation system (GIS) at site selection phase of urban regeneration on a case study that includes all the physical and social components of the study area as well as focusing on sustaining ecological, economic, and social features.",

Based on our analysis of current and future requirements, a system is proposed which allows for collection, organization and distribution of data within a computer network. In this application, two broad communities of users-physicians and epidemiologists-can be identified, each with their own perspectives and goals. The different requirements of each community lead us to a client-service centered architecture which provides the functionality requirements of the two groups. The resulting physician workstation provides help for recording and querying medical information about patients and from a pharmacological database. All information is classified and coded in order to be retrieved for pharmaco-economic studies. The service center receives information from physician workstations and permits organizations that are in charge of statistical studies to work with \"real\" data recorded during patient encounters. This leads to a new approach in epidemiology. Studies can be carried out with a more efficient data acquisition. For modelling the information system, we use an object-oriented approach. We have observed that the object-oriented representation, particularly its concepts of generalization, aggregation and encapsulation, are very usable for our problem.",

Primary challenges relate to the effectiveness of conservation program, availability of coherent biodiversity data, capacity building; awareness, training, and common understanding of biodiversity and protected area concept; coordination among the related institutions and stakeholders; and willingness and enthusiasm of authorities to accept and implement the concept.",

    "title": "Secure anonymity-preserving password-based user authentication and session key agreement scheme for telecare medicine information systems.",
    "abstract": "Information and communication and technology (ICT) has changed the entire paradigm of society. ICT facilitates people to use medical services over the Internet, thereby reducing the travel cost, hospitalization cost and time to a greater extent. Recent advancements in Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) facilitate users/patients to access medical services over the Internet by gaining health monitoring facilities at home. Amin and Biswas recently proposed a RSA-based user authentication and session key agreement protocol usable for TMIS, which is an improvement over Giri et al.'s RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS. In this paper, we show that though Amin-Biswas's scheme considerably improves the security drawbacks of Giri et al.'s scheme, their scheme has security weaknesses as it suffers from attacks such as privileged insider attack, user impersonation attack, replay attack and also offline password guessing attack. A new RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS is proposed, which overcomes the security pitfalls of Amin-Biswas's scheme and also preserves user anonymity property. The careful formal security analysis using the two widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the random oracle models is done. Moreover, the informal security analysis of the scheme is also done. These security analyses show the robustness of our new scheme against the various known attacks as well as attacks found in Amin-Biswas's scheme. The simulation of the proposed scheme using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool is also done. We present a new user authentication and session key agreement scheme for TMIS, which fixes the mentioned security pitfalls found in Amin-Biswas's scheme, and we also show that the proposed scheme provides better security than other existing schemes through the rigorous security analysis and verification tool. Furthermore, we present the formal security verification of our scheme using the widely accepted AVISPA tool. High security and extra functionality features allow our proposed scheme to be applicable for telecare medicine information systems which is used for e-health care medical applications.",

The DIABCARD project aims the implementation and evaluation of a chip card based medical information system (CCMIS) for facilitating communication and co-operation between health professionals in different organisations or departments caring the same patient with Diabetes as an example. In co-operation with the EC-funded TrustHealth project, the communication and application security services needed are provided as strong authentication and the derived services like authorization, access control, accountability, confidentiality etc. The solution is based on Health Professional Cards and Trusted Third Party services. Besides the secure handling of the patient's chip cart in DIABCARD workstations, also the secure communication between these workstations and related departmental systems has been implemented. Finally, a few legal issues, future trends like the XML standard set and their implications for the solution presented as well as for distributed health information systems in general are shortly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis-related group (DRG) system is a classification system widely used in health managements, the foundation of which lies in the medical information system. A large effort had been made to improve the quality of discharge data before the introduction of DRGs in Beijing. We extract discharge data from 108 local hospitals spanning 4 years before and after standardization to evaluate the impact of standardization on DRG grouping performance. The data was grouped on an annual basis in accordance with Beijing's local DRG system. Proportion of ungrouped data, coefficient of variation (CV) and reduction in variance (RIV) were used to measure the performance of the DRG system. Both the descriptive and regression analysis indicate a significant reduction in terms of ungrouped data and CV for expenditure, increase of RIV for expenditure and length of stay. However, when there was no intervention, that is, between 2005 and 2006 and between 2008 and 2009, changes in these indicators were all insignificant. Therefore, the standardization of discharge data did improve data quality and consequently enhanced the performance of DRGs. Developing countries with a relatively weak information infrastructure should strengthen their medical information system before the introduction of the DRG system.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the risk factors influencing the success of clinical information system projects. This study addresses this issue by first reviewing the extant literature on information technology project risks, and second conducting a Delphi survey among 21 experts highly involved in clinical information system projects in Québec, Canada, a region where government have invested heavily in health information technologies in recent years. Twenty-three risk factors were identified. The absence of a project champion was the factor that experts felt most deserves their attention. Lack of commitment from upper management was ranked second. Our panel of experts also confirmed the importance of a variable that has been extensively studied in information systems, namely, perceived usefulness that ranked third. Respondents ranked project ambiguity fourth. The fifth-ranked risk was associated with poor alignment between the clinical information systems' characteristics and the organization of clinical work. The large majority of risk factors associated with the technology itself were considered less important. This finding supports the idea that technology-associated factors rarely figure among the main reasons for a project failure. In addition to providing a comprehensive list of risk factors and their relative importance, the study presents a major contribution by unifying the literature on information systems and medical informatics. Our checklist provides a basis for further research that may help practitioners identify the effective countermeasures for mitigating risks associated with the implementation of clinical information systems.",

These measures have been used for quality improvement, for monitoring of health plan performance, and even for reimbursement models. Over the past 2 decades, legacy hip outcome scores have been developed that are patient-centric and evaluate hip-specific function after surgery. There has been a recent trend in using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a tool developed by the National Institutes of Health for evaluating PROMs, in the field of hip arthroscopy. However, on the basis of the evidence in the literature, it is unlikely that PROMIS is superior to legacy PROMs regarding evaluation of hip function, nor is it as responsive to quantifying meaningful changes in function that are important to patients. As such, clinicians and researchers alike should likely continue using legacy PROMs to evaluate patients' functional outcomes after hip arthroscopy while continuing to explore the clinical applications of other PROMIS domains.",

    "title": "Does mental health staffing level affect antipsychotic prescribing? Analysis of Italian national statistics.",
    "abstract": "In mental healthcare, one area of major concern identified by health information systems is variability in antipsychotic prescribing. While most studies have investigated patient- and prescriber-related factors as possible reasons for such variability, no studies have investigated facility-level characteristics. The present study ascertained whether staffing level is associated with antipsychotic prescribing in community mental healthcare. A cross-sectional analysis of data extracted from the Italian national mental health information system was carried out. For each Italian region, it collects data on the availability and use of mental health facilities. The rate of individuals exposed to antipsychotic drugs was tested for evidence of association with the rate of mental health staff availability by means of univariate and multivariate analyses. In Italy there were on average nearly 60 mental health professionals per 100,000 inhabitants, with wide regional variations (range 21 to 100). The average rate of individuals prescribed antipsychotic drugs was 2.33%, with wide regional variations (1.04% to 4.01%). Univariate analysis showed that the rate of individuals prescribed antipsychotic drugs was inversely associated with the rate of mental health professionals available in Italian regions (Kendall's tau -0.438, p = 0.006), with lower rates of antipsychotic prescriptions in regions with higher rates of mental health professionals. After adjustment for possible confounders, the total availability of mental health professionals was still inversely associated with the rate of individuals exposed to antipsychotic drugs. The evidence that staffing level was inversely associated with antipsychotic prescribing indicates that any actions aimed at decreasing variability in antipsychotic prescribing need to take into account aspects related to the organization of the mental health system.",

    "abstract": "To optimize blood ordering and accurately assess transfusion practice, in 1987, an \"on line\" computerized, knowledge-based, blood order critiquing system was integrated into the HELP Hospital Information System (HIS) at LDS Hospital. Evaluations of the computerized ordering system demonstrated its benefits and limitations on transfusion practice. Based on this experience, a second generation blood ordering system using a consultation mode was developed. A pilot test of this blood order consultant system, using historical data in the HELP system's database, was performed. This pilot test demonstrated that the consultation system provided accurate recommendations for red blood cell (RBC) and platelet orders. Comparing the appropriateness of blood orders with the recommendations made by the director of the blood bank, the orders recommended by the computer \"consultant\" agreed 95.5% of the time. The computer consultation system also recommended fewer RBC units for transfusion. Preliminary results obtained using the consultant approach suggest that we may be able to simplify blood ordering practice and also reduce the number of units of blood products ordered. Based on these findings we are now preparing to compare the \"critiquing\" and \"consultation\" approaches using a clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of digital imaging modalities in medicine, there is an increasing need for an efficient management and archival of medical images in digital form. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) are becoming an essential component of medical imaging equipment, allowing for medical images to be accessed and stored directly in digital form. This paper describes a hospital-wide PACS currently under development at the University Hospital of Geneva, based on an open architecture, regrouping equipment from different vendors in a distributed topology. The image archival is organized in multiple locations geographically distributed in the hospital. The PACS database is fully integrated with the concurrent Radiology Information System (RIS) and Hospital Information System (HIS). A standard image storage format called the PAPYRUS format was developed for the storage of medical images from a variety of imaging modalities. To provide a more uniform user interface on a variety of different workstations, a common platform for image display and manipulation called OSIRIS was developed.",

    "abstract": "Stone pavements are present in many cities and their historical and cultural importance is well recognized. However, there are no standard monitoring methods for this type of pavement that allow road managers to define appropriate maintenance strategies. In this study, a novel method is proposed in order to monitor the road surface conditions of stone pavements in a quick and easy way. Field tests were carried out in an Italian historic center using accelerometer sensors mounted on both a car and a bicycle. A post-processing phase of that data defined the comfort perception of the road users in terms of the index, as described in the ISO 2631 standard. The results derived from the dynamic surveys were also compared with the corresponding values of typical pavement indicators such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), measured only on a limited portion of the urban road network. The network's implementation in a Geographic Information System (GIS) represents the surveys' results in a graphical database. The specifications of the adopted method require that the network is divided into homogeneous sections, useful for measurement campaign planning, and adopted for the GIS' outputs representation. The comparisons between IRI- (R = 0.74) and PCI- (R = 0.96) confirmed that the proposed method can be used reliably to assess the stone pavement conditions on the whole urban road network.",

    "abstract": "More than 30 million people worldwide consume prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a daily basis. Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity owing to the use of NSAIDs is a well-recognized clinical problem, with approximately 25% of all reported adverse drug reactions being attributed to prescription NSAID use. In addition to prescription NSAIDs, the use of over-the-counter (OTC) formulations of these products is common. Although it has been suggested that OTC doses of NSAIDs may not lead to significant GI toxicity, the data confirming this have been lacking. Data on the GI risks of OTC doses of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, paracetamol, and no drug from 4164 consecutively diagnosed patients with rheumatoid arthritis from eight ARAMIS (Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System) centers in North America are presented. Serious GI events were defined as GI bleeds and other clinically significant GI events requiring hospitalization. Relative risks were standardized for potential demographic confounders using Cox proportional hazard models. Although the relative risk of OTC doses of NSAIDs (3 to 4) is less than the previously published risk of prescription doses (6 to 7), it remains clinically significant and a matter of serious concern because of the widespread use of these medications and an underappreciation of the true risk. Paracetamol was not associated with increased risk of GI complications and should be considered first-line therapy.",

Fortunately, a substantial part of ADEs is preventable, and computerised physician order entry with a sophisticated clinical decision support system may be used to reach this goal. To develop a new automated system that could improve the quality of medication surveillance. The system should focus on detecting patients at risk for an ADE by combining data from the hospital information system and computerised physician order entry (drug prescription data, drug-drug interaction alerts, clinical chemical laboratory parameters, demographic features), using clinical rules. The clinical rules were formulated in a multidisciplinary team, based on seven risk categories. The new system was composed in a guideline-based decision support framework consisting of both a guideline development module and a decision support module. A total of 121 clinical rules were built into the system. Validation of the system and a proof of principle test were performed. The adverse drug event alerting system (ADEAS) was developed and validated successfully. The proof of principle test showed that ADEAS has potential clinical usefulness. ADEAS generated alerts and detected additional potential risk situations, which were not generated by the conventional medication surveillance. We developed a pharmacy decision support system ADEAS that focuses on the detection of situations prone to lead to an ADE and might help clinicians to take timely corrective interventions and thereby can prevent patient harm.",

    "abstract": "In the Irbid Governorate, Jordan, equitable healthcare facility distribution is vital to ensuring healthcare accessibility and improving public health outcomes. This study investigated the spatial distribution, accessibility, and conformity of healthcare facilities to the Ministry of Health standards to identify areas requiring improvement. Using geographic information systems (GIS), three spatial analyses were conducted: nearest neighbor analysis, buffer analysis, and service area analysis. These analyses comprehensively assessed the healthcare landscape, revealing a random spatial distribution pattern of healthcare facilities; and indicating an absence of structured organization. The buffer analysis revealed concentrations in specific regions, while others were underserved. The Service Area Analysis revealed significant healthcare access challenges, especially in remote areas. The healthcare resource distribution of the Irbid governorate fell short of national and international standards, emphasizing the need for improvements. To address these disparities, policymakers and healthcare authorities should focus on equitably redistributing resources, tailoring allocation to local needs, improving remote area infrastructure, and refining government policies. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are imperative to ensure alignment with international standards and achieve healthcare equity. The insights from this case study provide valuable guidance for regions facing similar healthcare distribution challenges.",

A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of Virginia Medical Library. The results of the survey are based on replies by 246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and March 1973. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the printed indexes. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both. Asked whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would. The remaining 25% expressed some reservations and doubts.

    "abstract": "The research aim underpinning the Healthcare@Home (HH) information system described here was to enable 'near real time' risk analysis for disease early detection and prevention. To this end, we are implementing a family of prototype web services to 'push' or 'pull' individual's health-related data via an system of clinical hubs, mobile communication devices and/or dedicated home-based network computers. We are examining more efficient methods for ethical use of such data in timeline-based (i.e. 'longitudinal') data analysis systems. A consistent data collation infrastructure is being created for use along the 'patient path'--accessible wherever patients happen to be. This 'patient-centred' infrastructure can be applied in the evaluation of disease progression risk (in the light of clinical understanding of disease processes). In this paper we describe the requirements for making multi-data trend management 'scale-up', together with some requirements of an 'end-to-end' functioning data collection system. A Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach is used to maximise benefits from (1) clinical evidence and (2) computational models of disease progression that can be made available elsewhere on the SOA. We discuss the implications of this so-called 'closed loop' approach for improving healthcare intervention outcomes, patient safety, decision support, objective measurement of service quality and in providing inputs for quantitative healthcare (predictive) modelling.",

Accessibility was evaluated by using Floating Catchment Area (FCA), minimum distance methods and Response Time (RT) accessibility technique. More accurate measures of distances in Bandar Abbas, illustrated that Euclidean distances were not strongly correlated with network distances. The RT accessibility technique that utilizes shortest network path and time distances, presented detailed information about all the possible positions of the patients with respect to available healthcare services based on optimum and critical response times.

In this study we developed an alert system that extracts target problems from the raw data and verifies whether contraindicated medication is prescribed. This system scrutinizes data handled in the HIS. It picks up data needed to ascertain problems and data on medication entered. If patient data indicate impaired renal function, or the dosage is over prescribed according to a patient's renal function, the system sends an alert message. The system also determines whether a patient has liver diseases, renal diseases or diabetes mellitus based on clinical laboratory and prescription data, and checks whether a patient is prescribed medication that is contraindicated to his/her problem. When a physician selects patients from an inpatient or an outpatient list, the system presents alerts concerning these patients. We counted the number of alerts for inpatients. The frequency of alerts for overdose due to patients' renal function and contraindication for patients with liver disease were more frequent than alerts for other reasons. Of patients with renal dysfunction who were prescribed contraindicated medication, 24% had their medication discontinued before the alert system was put into operation. In contrast, that rate significantly increased to 54% after the alert system was initiated. We developed an alert system that extracts target problems and verifies whether inappropriate medication is prescribed. The alerts generated by this system were effectively contributed to discontinuing contraindicated medication.",

    "abstract": "Health service delivery indicators are designed to reveal how well health services meet a community's needs. Effective use of the data can enable targeted improvements in health service delivery. We conducted a systematic review to identify the factors that influence the use of health service delivery indicators to improve delivery of primary health care services in low- and middle-income settings. We reviewed empirical studies published in 2005 or later that provided evidence on the use of health service delivery data at the primary care level in low- and middle-income countries. We searched Scopus, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and citations of included studies. We also searched the gray literature, using a separate strategy. We extracted information on study design, setting, study population, study objective, key findings, and any identified lessons learned. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. This small number of studies suggests there is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions. However, a content analysis identified the following potentially influential factors, which we classified into 3 categories: governance (leadership, participatory monitoring, regular review of data); production of information (presentation of findings, data quality, qualitative data); and health information system resources (electronic health management information systems, organizational structure, training). Contextual factors and performance-based financing were also each found to have a role; however, discussing these as mediating factors may not be practical in terms of promoting data use. Scant evidence exists regarding factors that influence the use of health service delivery indicators to improve delivery of primary health care services in low- and middle-income countries. However, the existing evidence highlights some factors that may have a role in improving data use. Further research may benefit from comparing data use factors across different types of program indicators or using our classification as a framework for field experiments.",

Health information systems (HIS) are important tools in guidance towards patient safety and better outcomes. However, still, morbidity and mortality attributed to medical errors remain an important issue that needs to be addressed. The objective of the present study was to assess the health information system in terms of technological, environmental, organizational and human factors affecting the adoption as well as the perceptions of stakeholders along with barriers and constraints related to successful implementation. A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Prospective data was collected from primary sources by self-administering the pre-validated questionnaires as well as by physical verification of the availability of equipment. After data collection, data was analyzed to assess the health information management systems. The results of the present study showed that the health information system in Pakistan is not up to the mark. The equipment was mostly unavailable at the primary healthcare facilities. The staff was also unsatisfied with the available services. Administrative, financial and human constraints were identified as the major barriers towards successful implementation and management of HIS. The present study concluded that the health information system of Pakistan needs to be revamped. Health information management system partially existed at district and sub-district offices, while was completely absent at tertiary, secondary and primary healthcare levels. The poor adoption of health information technology systems at healthcare facilities might largely be attributed to insufficient human resources with limited resources and budget allocation for health in Pakistan. Effective and timely strategies involving all important stakeholders and healthcare professionals must be designed and implemented at the National level to restructure an affordable, resilient and quality healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of diagnostic-imaging technologies over the past two decades has dramatically increased the amount of nontextual data generated in clinical medicine. The architecture of traditional, text-oriented, clinical information systems has made the integration of digitized clinical images with the patient record problematic. Systems for the classification, retrieval, and integration of clinical images are in their infancy. Recent advances in high-performance computing, imaging, and networking technology now make it technologically and economically feasible to develop an integrated, multimedia, electronic patient record. As part of The National Library of Medicine's Biomedical Applications of High-Performance Computing and Communications program, we plan to develop Image Engine, a prototype microcomputer-based system for the storage, retrieval, integration, and sharing of a wide range of clinically important digital images. Images stored in the Image Engine database will be indexed and organized using the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus and will be dynamically linked to data in a text-based, clinical information system. We will evaluate Image Engine by initially implementing it in three clinical domains (oncology, gastroenterology, and clinical pathology) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.",

    "abstract": "Spatially distributed sediment delivery (SEDD) models are of great interest in estimating the expected effect of changes on soil erosion and sediment yield. However, they can only be applied if the model can be calibrated using observed data. This paper presents a geographic information system (GIS)-based method to calculate the sediment discharge from basins to coastal areas. For this, an SEDD model, with a sediment rating curve method based on observed data, is proposed and validated. The model proposed here has been developed using the combined application of the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and a spatially distributed sediment delivery ratio, within Model Builder of ArcGIS's software. The model focuses on spatial variability and is useful for estimating the spatial patterns of soil loss and sediment discharge. The model consists of two modules, a soil erosion prediction component and a sediment delivery model. The integrated approach allows for relatively practical and cost-effective estimation of spatially distributed soil erosion and sediment delivery, for gauged or ungauged basins. This paper provides the first attempt at estimating sediment delivery ratio based on observed data in the monsoon region of Korea.",

Moreover, there is a considerable amount of haplotype variation associated with drug metabolism that is currently insufficiently addressed. Here, we present a web-based electronic Pharmacogenomics Assistant (ePGA; http://www.epga.gr/) that provides personalized genotype-to-phenotype translation, linked to state of the art clinical guidelines. ePGA's translation service matches individual genotype-profiles with PGx gene haplotypes and infers the corresponding diplotype and phenotype profiles, accompanied with summary statistics. Additional features include i) the ability to customize translation based on subsets of variants of clinical interest, and ii) to update the knowledge base with novel PGx findings. We demonstrate ePGA's functionality on genetic variation data from the 1000 Genomes Project.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the 3LGM(2) tool, a tool for modeling information systems, and describe the process of modeling parts of the hospital information system of the Leipzig University Hospital (UKL(a)). We modeled the sub information systems of five patient record archiving sections to support the creation of a proposal for governmental financial support for a new document management and archiving system. We explain the steps of identifying the model elements and their relations as well as the analyzing capabilities of the 3LGM(2) tool to answer questions about the information system. The 3LGM(2) tool was developed on the basis of the meta model 3LGM(2) which is described in detail in [1]. 3LGM(2) defines an ontological basis, divided into three layers and their relationships. In addition to usual meta CASE tools, the 3LGM(2) tool meets certain requirements of information management in hospitals. The model described in this article was created on the base of on-site surveys in five archiving sections of the UKL. A prototype of the 3LGM(2) tool is available and is currently tested in some projects at the UKL and partner institutions. The model presented in this article is a structured documentation about the current state of patient record archiving at the UKL. The analyzing capabilities of the 3LGM(2) tool help to use the model and to answer questions about the information system. The 3LGM(2) tool can be used to model and analyze information systems. The presentation capabilities and the reliability of the prototype have to be improved. The initial modeling effort of an institution is only valuable if the model is maintained regularly and reused in other projects. Reference catalogues and reference models are needed to decrease this effort and to support the creation of comparable models.",

On the basis of the critique of this work, the authors present their proposal for a solution: first the IR components, their boundaries and relationships are identified, and then the two models of IR are introduced. One of the models addresses components of the IR process and relationships between them, the second one is the process model of IR.",

In 1 case, rapid, near-simultaneous order entry was the culprit; in the second, astute order management by a clinician, unaware of the lack of proper 2-way interface messaging from the external clinical system, led to the confusion. Although testing had shown that the laboratory system would cancel duplicate laboratory orders, it was thought that duplicate alerting in the new order entry system would prevent such events.",

The purpose of this paper is to report a step-wise protocol, using geographic information system techniques and tools, developed to collect and analyze the type of spatial data necessary to calculate the distance between rural villages and maternity waiting homes located near rural primary healthcare facilities in Bong County, Liberia. Using a step-wise approach incorporating local healthcare provider knowledge, intensive field work, and spatial technologies such as Open Street Map and Google Maps for village geospatial data collection and verification, we identified village locations of 93.7% of the women who accessed the five maternity waiting homes in our study from 2012 to 2016.",

They support synchronous communication on multiple channels among groups of people who are spatially distributed. In this paper, we suggest reasons for why the voice loop system is a successful medium for supporting coordination in space shuttle mission control based on over 130 hours of direct observation. Voice loops allow practitioners to listen in on relevant communications without disrupting their own activities or the activities of others. In addition, the voice loop system is structured around the mission control organization, and therefore directly supports the demands of the domain. By understanding how voice loops meet the particular demands of the mission control environment, insight can be gained for the design of groupware tools to support cooperative activity in other event-driven domains.",

Its aim is to use an ontological approach to implement an information system for the French Fibromuscular Dysplasia Registry. The existing data was dispersed in numerous databases, which had been created independently. These databases have different structures and contain data of diverse quality. The project aims to provide generic solutions for the management of the communication of medical data. The secondary objective is to demonstrate the applicability of these generic solutions in the field of rare diseases (RD) in an operational context. The construction of the French FMD registry was a multistep process. A secure platform has been available since the beginning of November 2013. The medical records of 471 patients from the initial dataset provided by the HEGP-Paris, France have been included, and are accessible from a secure user account. Users are organized into a collaborative group, and can access patient groups. Each electronic patient record contains more than 2,200 items. The problem of semantic interoperability has become one of the major challenges for the development of applications requiring the sharing and reuse of data. The information system component of the SIR-FMD project has a direct impact on the standardisation of coding of rare diseases and thereby contributes to the development of e-Health.",

This information system is proving useful to policymakers for answering such questions as: Which populations need more physician services? Which need fewer? Are high-risk populations poorly served? or do they have poor health outcomes despite being well served? Does high utilization represent overuse? or is it related to high need? More specifically, this system provides decision makers with the capability to make critical comparisons across regions and subregions of residents' health status, socioeconomic risk characteristics and use of hospitals, nursing homes, and physicians. The system permits analyses of demographic changes, expenditure patterns, and hospital performance in relation to the population served. The integrated database has also facilitated outcomes research across hospitals and countries, utilization review within a single hospital, and longitudinal research on health reform. The discussion highlights the strengths of integrated population-based information in analyzing the health care system and raising important questions about the relationship between health care and health.",

    "title": "Practice, enablers and barriers of health information system accountability framework in Northwest Ethiopia 2023.",
    "abstract": "The government of Ethiopia has designed different initiatives for the Health Information Systems (HIS), including an Information Revolution (IR) transformation agenda by 2015. Various interventions and working documents have also been developed and implemented targeting the different aspects of the HIS program. However, there is no nationally designed accountability framework to govern HIS activities. Besides, how health institutions follow and monitor HIS activities is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the practice and barriers of HIS accountability framework at the selected public health institutions. A descriptive qualitative study design was employed from June 05 to July 12, 2023. Purposively selected informants from public health institutions were recruited for key informant interviews. A prepared pilot-tested semi-structured interview guide was used. The conventional content approach was used to summarize and synthesize the information explored. The study revealed that most respondents described the concept and advantages of the HIS accountability framework in different ways. The participants believed the HIS accountability framework would help to govern and manage behavioral-related HIS challenges. It was indicated that the framework will help to control the recurrence of HIS errors, enhance the commitment and adherence of health professionals, and improve data handover practice, data security and privacy, data quality, informed decision, and finality quality of care. Lack of national guidelines on the HIS accountability framework, the poor culture of accountability, multiple responsibilities and workload, high staff and leadership turnover, lack of motivation, and security problems were stated barriers to implementation of the HIS accountability framework. It was suggested to create a conducive work environment, engage health professionals and other actors during the intervention development, build the skills on HIS leadership, and have the national HIS accountability framework document to implement the intervention effectively. Even if there is a better understanding of the concept and advantages of the HIS accountability framework, its practice across the system is limited. It would be better to design the HIS accountability framework using a human-centered design/approach by engaging the key HIS actors and understanding their working environment.",

    "abstract": "The transfer of medical data within heterogeneous hard- and software infrastructures requires platform-independent standardized protocols and data formats such as DICOM. To avoid costly vendor-specific solutions a DICOM server was implemented in JAVA thereby enabling the data access via internet browser technology. The most important patient and image acquisition information were extracted from the DICOM images and stored into a relational database. For an integrated view patient information such as radiological findings were transferred from the Radiological Information System (RIS) into the data base. Image data were accessed either by a fast preview tool or using a DICOM viewer. Since DICOM does not include inherent data security mechanisms, a second tool allowed the DICOM-conform encryption of DCIOM data for a secure long term storage on CD-R or across unsecure networks.",

A brief description of NANDA nursing diagnoses is provided along with a discussion of issues regarding implementation of these nursing diagnoses in a clinical information system. This system did not support online documentation of patient problems, therefore the challenge was to add documentation of patient problems to the system's software. This article focuses on the design and implementation of the nursing diagnoses computer screens, rather than focusing on the two problems we encountered during implementation--appropriate use of nursing diagnoses and the fit of nursing diagnoses with nursing interventions. Yet, the lessons learned in designing and implementing NANDA nursing diagnoses online may help others.",

Analysis and reporting features were designed to assist both laboratory investigators and NCI staff in evaluating the mutagenic activity of test compounds. The analysis has focused on two principal goals: using the computer to examine the results of each test to determine if the test was adequate for a further statistical analysis; and secondly, if the plate counts are adequate, developing statistics that indicate whether there is a positive or negative trend.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to establish a method for evaluating the possibility of pregnant women evacuating to tsunami evacuation buildings in coastal areas affected by tsunami. We used data published by the Japanese government and a general-purpose geographic information system to develop a simulation method for evaluating the possibility of evacuation. The data included the number of pregnant women in each elementary school district, tsunami inundation forecast maps, location information of tsunami evacuation buildings, and the number of ordinary buildings. We used our method to conduct a tsunami evacuation possibility simulation for pregnant women in each elementary school district in 7 wards of Nagoya, Japan. Dense population areas at low elevations are high-risk areas from which many pregnant women may not be able to evacuate. Districts with evenly distributed tsunami evacuation buildings tend to have a lower risk. The proposed simulation method was able to determine the risk in elementary school districts in densely populated low-lying areas. However, it is suggested that the risk tends to be estimated higher in school districts where there are differences in elevation and the building distribution is not uniform.",

As regards direct users, impact was evaluated through a structured interview. Administrative personnel, that have been using computer-based system for at least ten years, have not declared particular inconveniences, accepting the overtime or the extra-work as simply unavoidable. On the contrary, health-care personnel reported a heavy negative impact of the system failure on their activity. After a great effort to achieve the system acceptance and direct physicians usage, the blackout of the system has pointed out that the situation has changed since a few years ago: now the HIS, and particularly its clinical core, is considered mission critical.",

The data revealed incompleteness and inconsistencies in information. Regarding the profile, females are more affected in the morbidity profile, and men have a higher mortality rate. Poisoning was more frequent in young adults with low educational level. With regard to the circumstances, most of the cases were suicide attempts, unique acute cases and not related to work. Despite suggesting underreporting, the data showed that persons engaged in agriculture are most commonly affected. The strengthening of these systems is necessary for the generation of consistent information that support health policies for the population groups involved.",

    "title": "Medical schools in India: pattern of establishment and impact on public health - a Geographic Information System (GIS) based exploratory study.",
    "abstract": "Indian medical education system is on the brink of a massive reform. The government of India has recently passed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC Bill). It seeks to eliminate the existing shortage and maldistribution of health professionals in India. It also encourages establishment of medical schools in underserved areas. Hence this study explores the geographic distribution of medical schools in India to identify such under and over served areas. Special emphasis has been given to the mapping of new medical schools opened in the last decade to identify the ongoing pattern of expansion of medical education sector in India. All medical schools retrieved from the online database of Medical Council of India were plotted on the map of India using geographic information system. Their pattern of establishment was identified. Medical school density was calculated to analyse the effect of medical school distribution on health care indicators. Presence of medical schools had a positive influence on the public health profile. But medical schools were not evenly distributed in the country. The national average medical school density in India amounted to 4.08 per 10 million population. Medical school density of provinces revealed a wide range from 0 (Nagaland, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Lakshadweep) to 72.12 (Puducherry). Medical schools were seen to be clustered in the vicinity of major cities as well as provincial capitals. Distance matrix revealed that the median distance of a new medical school from its nearest old medical school was just 22.81 Km with an IQR of 6.29 to 56.86 Km. This study revealed the mal-distribution of medical schools in India. The problem is further compounded by selective opening of new medical schools within the catchment area of already established medical schools. Considering that medical schools showed a positive influence on public health, further research is needed to guide formulation of rules for medical school establishment in India.",

    "title": "Developing national health information in Australia.",
    "abstract": "Two significant developments in the past two years have given impetus to development of health information in Australia. In March 1993, the former National Minimum Data Set was revised and published as the National Health Data Dictionary. Second, establishment of an agreement in June 1993, between the Commonwealth and State/Territory government health authorities, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare initiated a process of working cooperatively to develop national health information. Australia, like many other countries, suffers from inconsistent health data definitions, lack of timely data, poor data quality, gaps in data coverage, and barriers to accessing the data. The National Health Information Agreement [1] came into effect on June 1, 1993 and seeks to provide a national framework and processes to improve national health information, that is, information on health of the population; determinants of the population's health; provision and utilization of health promotion and disease prevention programs and health services including: outcomes and outputs, resource use and costs, access by and distribution to population groups; relationships between these elements; and the language necessary to facilitate provision of services and collection of national health information. The major implementation mechanism of the Agreement is a rolling three-year National Health Information Work Program of national health information activities. The activities range from development work on standard hospital charts of accounts, on health outcome measures, and on new collections such as outpatients to improved definitions and the enhancement of existing collections such as mental health and vital statistics. The Work Program is published annually. A first priority is to improve the data collections available. This is being achieved through the setting of national data definitions and standards. The Agreement recognizes the National Health Data Dictionary (NHDD) as the authoritative set of national definitions and is a significant initiative aimed at improving Australia's health information. The dictionary is the repository of the agreed common language, use of the definitions facilities the description and comparison of health and health services nationally [2]. The National Health Data Dictionary currently covers institutionally provided health care, the national health labor force, and is expanding to cover other major areas, including outpatient services, community care, and mental health. The NHDD is reviewed and maintained by the National Health Data Committee and the overall coordination of definition development projects and publication is undertaken by the Institute. The placement of an agreed definition in the NHDD does not automatically mean that it has a place in a national data collection. The use of the dictionary definition will allow comparison by and between service providers. In order for a data item to be eligible for inclusion in a national minimum data set, the definition of that item must be contained in the NHDD. During the first three months of 1995, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare will conduct a national project to develop a model for the health system in Australia. The model will provide a common vocabulary and information architecture in order to facilitate better quality health information, and consequently better health for Australians. It is expected that the development of the model will bring several benefits including facilitating the more rapid and accurate assembly of appropriate clinical information to support improved customer service and outcomes, provide a mechanism for achieving better quality information, reduce the costs of data collection; provide enabling mechanisms for the integration of systems via data standards and reduce the costs of acquiring information systems through reduced development and tailoring costs for suppliers.

    "abstract": "Public health emergencies like earthquakes and tsunamis underscore the need for an evidence-based approach to disaster preparedness. Using the Japanese administrative database and the geographical information system (GIS), the interruption of hospital-based mechanical ventilation administration by a hypothetical disaster in three areas of the southeastern mainland (Tokai, Tonankai, and Nankai) was simulated and the repercussions on ventilator care in the prefectures adjacent to the damaged prefectures was estimated. Using the database of 2010 including 3,181,847 hospitalized patients among 952 hospitals, the maximum daily ventilator capacity in each hospital was calculated and the number of patients who were administered ventilation on October xx was counted. Using GIS and patient zip code, the straight-line distances among the damaged hospitals, the hospitals in prefectures nearest to damaged prefectures, and ventilated patients' zip codes were measured. The authors simulated that ventilated patients were transferred to the closest hospitals outside damaged prefectures. The increase in the ventilator operating rates in three areas was aggregated. One hundred twenty-four and 236 patients were administered ventilation in the damaged hospitals and in the closest hospitals outside the damaged prefectures of Tokai, 92 and 561 of Tonankai, and 35 and 85 of Nankai, respectively. The increases in the ventilator operating rates among prefectures ranged from 1.04 to 26.33-fold in Tokai; 1.03 to 1.74-fold in Tonankai, and 1.00 to 2.67-fold in Nankai. Administrative databases and GIS can contribute to evidenced-based disaster preparedness and the determination of appropriate receiving hospitals with available medical resources.",

    "abstract": "The model of bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set is a very famous and dominant principle to cope with vague and uncertain information. The bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set contained the positive membership function, negative membership function, and linguistic variable, where the technique of fuzzy sets to bipolar fuzzy sets are the special cases of the bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set. In this manuscript, we describe the model of Aczel-Alsina operational laws for bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic values based on Aczel-Alsina t-norm and Aczel-Alsina t-conorm. Additionally, we compute the Aczel-Alsina power aggregation operators based on bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic data, called bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power averaging operator, bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power weighted averaging operator, bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power geometric operator, and bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power weighted geometric operator with some dominant and fundamental laws such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Moreover, we initiate the model of the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment technique with the help of consequent theory. In the context of geographic information systems and spatial information systems, coupling aims to find out the relationships among different components within a geographic information system, where coupling can occur at many stages, for instance, spatial coupling, data coupling, and functional coupling. To evaluate the above dilemma, we perform the model of multi-attribute decision-making for invented operators to compute the best technique for addressing geographic information systems. In the last, we deliberate some numerical examples for comparing the ranking results of proposed and prevailing techniques.",

    "abstract": "We describe the processes involved in the development of an information system which can assess how care given by a number of agencies could be monitored by those agencies. In particular, it addresses the problem of sharing information as the boundaries of each agency are crossed. It focuses on the care of one specific patient group--the rehabilitation of elderly patients in the community, which provided an ideal multi-agency setting. It also describes: how a stakeholder participative approach to information system development was undertaken, based in part on the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) approach (Checkland, 1981, 1990); some of the difficulties encountered in using such an approach; and the ways in which these were addressed. The paper goes on to describe an assessment tool called SCARS (the Southampton Community Ability Rating Scale). It concludes by reflecting on the management lessons arising from this project. It also observes, inter alia, how stakeholders have a strong preference for simpler, non-IT based systems, and comments on the difficulties encountered by stakeholders in attempting to reconcile their perceptions of the needs of their discipline or specialty with a more patient-centred approach of an integrated system.",

    "title": "Role of geographic information system (GIS) in watershed simulation by WinVAST model.",
    "abstract": "The uncertainty of modeling input will increase the simulation error, and this situation always happens in a model without user-friendly interface. WinVAST model, developed by the University of Virginia in 2003, treats an entire multi-catchment by a tree-view structure. Its extra computer programs can connect geographic information system (GIS). Model users can prepare all the necessary information in ArcGIS. Extracting information from GIS interface can not only decrease the inconvenience of data input, but also lower the uncertainty due to data preparation. The Daiyuku Creek and Qupoliao Creek in the Fei-tsui reservoir watershed in Northern Taiwan provided the setting for the case study reported herein. The required information, including slope, stream length, subbasin area, soil type and land-use condition, for WinVAST model should be prepared in a Microsoft Access database, which is the project file of WinVAST with extension mdb. In ArcGIS interface, when the soil layer, land-use layer, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) map are prepared, all the watershed information can be created as well. This study compared the simulation results from automatically generated input and manual input. The results show that the relative simulation error resulting from the rough process of data input can be around 30% in runoff simulation, and even reach 70% in non-point source pollution (NPSP) simulation. It could conclude that GIS technology is significant for predicting watershed responses by WinVAST model, because it can efficiently reduce the uncertainty induced by input errors.",

    "title": "Mechanisms for successful management of enterprise resource planning from user information processing and system quality perspective.",
    "abstract": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are now ubiquitous in modern organizations. A number of previous studies have focused only on system factors and perceptions, there is a noticeable shortfall in research that concurrently addresses technological factors and human roles in explaining user satisfaction. This study aimed to identify these variables from the perspectives of information systems, technology, and human participation, thereby addressing this knowledge gap. The focus of the study was a large shipbuilding and marine company utilizing an ERP system. The participants, a sample of 234 ERP users, were carefully selected by the company's executives and practitioners, and data was collected through online questionnaires. They were selected through purposive sampling from among employees who use ERP systems in large-scale shipbuilding and marine engineering companies. The study aimed to clarify the relationships between user satisfaction and perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, system quality, service quality, participation, and information quality. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the collected data. The results indicated that perceived ease of use, system quality, service quality, and participation positively influenced user satisfaction, whereas perceived usefulness did not have a significant impact. Interestingly, participation was found to lessen the effects of perceived usefulness on satisfaction. The findings of this study suggest that to enhance ERP user satisfaction, managers should strive to make the ERP system easy-to-use and stable, encourage employee participation in the decision-making process, and bolster the role of the support team. It should be noted, however, that the study has limitations as it did not consider all possible factors, such as training and support. Future research should take a broader view of the variables involved in the operation of an enterprise-wide information system.",

    "title": "A reuse oriented Development Database: the HELIOS Object Information System.",
    "abstract": "This paper describes the Development Database of a Software Engineering Environment (SEE), that couples reuse and object-oriented technologies. We propose a classification model for the repository of reusable components that is a support for an efficient retrieval mechanism, and a reusable component model that considers components of large and low-granularity levels (e.g., application frameworks and methods of a given class). The reusable component model is based on the underlying idea that development components are not operational components since they do not have the same purpose. This model first represents each component as an aggregation of other sub-components, together with all information needed for its retrieval (e.g., classification and facets), its under-standing (e.g., informal functional description) and its dependencies with other development components, in particular the applications in which it occurs, since applications are considered also as abstract development components. This approach was tested thanks to an existing application which was loaded into the SEE. From that moment, it was possible to regenerate a new application in a reasonably short time. Moreover, the existence of a retrieval tool permits to validate the development components classification, but also put forward the importance of the qualification step. In particular, the versioning should be carefully processed. Furthermore the fact that all the development objects are built on an homogeneous model allows easier tools management and interapplication reusability.",

    "title": "Improving chemotherapy processes with a protocol-based information system: a pre and post-implementation study.",
    "abstract": "The medical application domain has been a great challenge for information technology solutions for decades, especially when the target process has been complex and multidisciplinary such as chemotherapy processes. To evaluate the impact of a homegrown protocol based information system on the efficiency of chemotherapy workflow processes in an outpatient setting. A day care unit of the Hematology/Oncology outpatient clinic of Erasmus Medical Center was the setting for this study. The study consisted of comparison of pre- and post-implementation of four workflow efficiency related external indicators: turn-around times of a commonly administered chemotherapy course (Paclitaxel-Carboplatin), chemotherapy course administration postponing rate, the rate of recording course administration time, and patient admission rate of the outpatient clinic. The data was gathered retrospectively from patient charts and information systems' log files. For the purpose of turn-around-time 109 Paclitaxel-Carboplatin chemotherapy courses of pre-implementation were compared to 118 those of post-implementation. For the other indicators: 247 chemotherapy courses pre-implementation were compared to 324 courses post-implementation. The process maps of pre- and post-implementation were also compared to each other. The implementation of the system improved the process by removing repetition and sequencing of the tasks. Following the implementation, chemotherapy postponing decreased by 17.2% (Z = -4.723, P = .000) and there were 5.7% less records with missing administration time (Z =-3.047, P = .002). The admission rate increased 1.9 patient per working day (t(94) = -5.974, P = .000). The overall turn-around-time reduced 18.9 min following the implementation (t(169) = 3.48, P = .001). In a multivariate multiple regression model the reduction in turn-around time was related to the implementation of the system (Pillai's Trace = 0.159, F(4,161) = 7.613, P = .000). Information systems based on treatment protocols can reduce communication and synchronization needs between the stakeholders in a complex workflow process. These systems can help reengineering the process and improve workflow efficiency by removing unnecessary sequencing and repetitions of tasks.",

    "title": "Understanding the dynamics of information technology implementation: a study of clinical information systems.",
    "abstract": "Health care institutions are considering a variety of emerging information technologies (ITs) in the hope of increasing efficiency, reducing costs, re-engineering work processes, and improving quality of care. The recent, rapid advances made in the use of innovative ITs in the health care field can present a plethora of problems to the administrative staff. Perhaps the most pressing of these concerns is the ability of today's hospitals to effectively create and utilize computer-based information systems. IT implementation has long been of great interest for information systems researchers. This branch of information system study seeks to identify those factors that are integral to optimizing the usage of IT. For example, researchers have advised practitioners that managerial support, high quality system design, commitment to advancing with the field, and extensive project planning are all key elements of successful system. In sum, previous research has produced a set of managerial proscriptions which, taken as a whole, constitute the \"ideal\" way to implement an IT system. Yet despite these normative principles and proscriptions, many health care institutions continue to find their attempts to make use of IT fraught with difficulty. Therefore, the objective of this study is to broaden and edify our understanding of IT implementation. More specifically, we seek to dispel the myth of the \"ideal\" system setup by exploring some of the alternative systems in use. We wish to investigate how and why the components of these alternative systems interact to produce utilization success (or failure). The study investigates the establishment and subsequent use of three clinical information systems (CIS) in a large tertiary care teaching hospital. The first case study is that of the hospital-wide implementation of a computer system that allows physicians to sign their medical records electronically. The second case examines the use of an electronic patient chart used to support the work of a variety of clinicians. Finally, we study a nursing assessment system used by two groups of nurses (intensive care unit and resuscitation unit) at a state-of-the-art, newly established Trauma Center. Qualitative was gathered through semi-structured interviews with people involved in the implementation process as well as a sample of user representatives. More than 90 interviews were conducted over a period of six months. Observational data completed our qualitative assessment. Quantitative evidence was gathered through questionnaires administered to a small sample of key informants. Three techniques of qualitative data analysis are being used in combination, namely, coding, analytical memos and displays. Data analysis is still in its infancy at this point. Regarding its relevance to the role of the administrator, this study will allow general and health care management as well as IT professionals to gain insight into the dynamics of the implementation of innovative technologies. In other words, results from this study will provide clear and relevant answers to the questions of how and why the outcome of the information system project is influenced by the way in which the technology is introduced.",

This system suffer a severe crisis, probably due to the scarce uses of the information and/or because the system produce exclusively information about communicable diseases or outbreaks. In the last few years, information sources and procedure have been developed out of the official surveillance, such as cancer register, traffic accidents or air contamination statistics and so on. Moreover, national and regional health plans which signify specific health objectives entail information tools with ability to rank and evaluate the interventions. The principal health information system useful to surveillance has been described. We conclude that the expression public health surveillance define much better the functions of a) monitoring and evaluation of the health policy and b) detection and research of epidemics. Finally, we identify some elements for the change, such as: a) to include information related to adverse effects of the sanitary interventions, and environmental and occupational hazards; b) to facilitate the access of information by means of self-operating database and c) to make comparable the different information sources.",

Yet we are at roughly the same place the aviation industry was in the 1950s with respect to system safety. Even if ICT harm rates do not increase, increased ICT use will increase the absolute number of ICT related harms. Factors that could diminish ICT harm include adoption of common standards, technology maturity, better system development, testing, implementation and end user training. Factors that will increase harm rates include complexity and heterogeneity of systems and their interfaces, rapid implementation and poor training of users. Mitigating these harms will not be easy, as organizational inertia is likely to generate a hysteresis-like lag, where the paths to increase and decrease harm are not identical.",

Remetinec Health Center served as a model of computer data processing (CDP) in primary health care and Sveti Duh General Hospital in inpatient CDP, whereas hospital administration and health service were first introduced to Zagreb University Hospital Center and Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital. At Varazdin Medical Center CDP for health care services started in 1970. Several registries of chronic diseases have been established: cancer, psychosis, alcoholism, and hospital registries as well as pilot registries of lung tuberculosis patients and diabetics. Health statistics reports on healthcare services, work accidents and sick-leaves as well as on hospital mortality started to be produced by CDP in 1977. Besides alphanumeric data, the modern information technology (IT) can give digital images and signals. Communication in health care system demands a standardized format of all information, especially for telemedicine. In 2000, Technical Committee for Standardization in Medical Informatics was founded in Croatia, in order to monitor the activities of the International Standardization Organization (ISO) and Comite Européen de Normalisation (CEN), and to implement their international standards in the Croatian standardization procedure. The HL7 Croatia has also been founded to monitor developments in the communication standard HL7. So far, the Republic of Croatia has a number of acts regulating informatization in general and consequently the informatization of the health care system (Act on Personal Data Confidentiality, Act on Digital Signature, Act of Standardization) enacted. The ethical aspect of data security and data protection has been covered by the Code of Ethics for medical informaticians. It has been established by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), and the Croatian Society of Medical Informatics (CSMI) has translated it into Croatian and published it on its website. Based on a survey of medical staff attitudes toward health care system informatization, the Croatian health system appears to be ready for informatization. The only requirement is that the present and future health care providers have appropriate medical informatics education, proper computer equipment at their workplace, and an opportunity to participate in the development and/or improvement of the health information system. One of the EU health strategy priorities is the improvement of health information and knowledge. It means that integrated health information systems are required, i.e. systems able to provide key information on health and health care system to the politicians, health professionals and public in general.",

Paradigm and concepts used are based on the component architecture of information systems and on a general layered security model. The toolset was developed in 1996/1997 within the ISHTAR project funded by the European Commission as well as through international standardisation activities. Analysing and systematising real health care scenarios, only six and nine use case types could be found in the health and the security-related view, respectively. By combining these use case types, the analysis and design of any thinkable system architecture can be simplified significantly. Based on generic schemes, the environment needed for both communication and application security can be established by appropriate sets of security services and mechanisms. Because of the importance and the basic character of electronic health care record (EHCR) systems, the understanding of the approach is facilitated by (incomplete) examples for this application.",

    "title": "GIS, geostatistics, metadata banking, and tree-based models for data analysis and mapping in environmental monitoring and epidemiology.",
    "abstract": "By the example of environmental monitoring, some applications of geographic information systems (GIS), geostatistics, metadata banking, and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are presented. These tools are recommended for mapping statistically estimated hot spots of vectors and pathogens. GIS were introduced as tools for spatially modelling the real world. The modelling can be done by mapping objects according to the spatial information content of data. Additionally, this can be supported by geostatistical and multivariate statistical modelling. This is demonstrated by the example of modelling marine habitats of benthic communities and of terrestrial ecoregions. Such ecoregionalisations may be used to predict phenomena based on the statistical relation between measurements of an interesting phenomenon such as, e.g., the incidence of medically relevant species and correlated characteristics of the ecoregions. The combination of meteorological data and data on plant phenology can enhance the spatial resolution of the information on climate change. To this end, meteorological and phenological data have to be correlated. To enable this, both data sets which are from disparate monitoring networks have to be spatially connected by means of geostatistical estimation. This is demonstrated by the example of transformation of site-specific data on plant phenology into surface data. The analysis allows for spatial comparison of the phenology during the two periods 1961-1990 and 1991-2002 covering whole Germany. The changes in both plant phenology and air temperature were proved to be statistically significant. Thus, they can be combined by GIS overlay technique to enhance the spatial resolution of the information on the climate change and use them for the prediction of vector incidences at the regional scale. The localisation of such risk hot spots can be done by geometrically merging surface data on promoting factors. This is demonstrated by the example of the transfer of heavy metals through soils. The predicted hot spots of heavy metal transfer can be validated empirically by measurement data which can be inquired by a metadata base linked with a geographic information system. A corresponding strategy for the detection of vector hot spots in medical epidemiology is recommended. Data on incidences and habitats of the Anophelinae in the marsh regions of Lower Saxony (Germany) were used to calculate a habitat model by CART, which together with climate data and data on ecoregions can be further used for the prediction of habitats of medically relevant vector species. In the future, this approach should be supported by an internet-based information system consisting of three components: metadata questionnaire, metadata base, and GIS to link metadata, surface data, and measurement data on incidences and habitats of medically relevant species and related data on climate, phenology, and ecoregional characteristic conditions.",

This has been facilitated by the wide availability of low-cost sensors, advances in computational resources, the maturity of mapping algorithms, and the need for accurate and on-demand geographic information system (GIS) data and digital maps. Many MMSs combine hybrid sensors to provide a more informative, robust, and stable solution by complementing each other. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive review of the modern MMSs by focusing on: (1) the types of sensors and platforms, discussing their capabilities and limitations and providing a comprehensive overview of recent MMS technologies available in the market; (2) highlighting the general workflow to process MMS data; (3) identifying different use cases of mobile mapping technology by reviewing some of the common applications; and (4) presenting a discussion on the benefits and challenges and sharing our views on potential research directions.",

    "abstract": "KIND (stands for Kyushu university hospital Information Network Database) is a five years project, which aims to provide integrated services for patients, physicians, researchers and other hospital staffs. The final product of KIND is a next generation hospital information system. A physicians' clinical workstation, for example, integrated into a secured medical information network, can electronically develop a longitudinal medical record and interface with pharmacies, laboratories, medical specialists, and radiologists, as well as develop patient census and demographic profiles, in addition to doing electronic claims. Since clinical requirements on those medical records may vary for each case, we would like to have an essential data model under the hood. We decided to introduce domain analysis method to produce a relevant domain model. A domain analysis method captures the nature of business and helps us have an essential and extensible data model. Although there are several ways to describe a domain model, we chose an object-oriented description and consequently implementation using an object-oriented database system. Once we could have a decent domain model and implemented it as an object-oriented data model, application programs can utilize those data very easy without worrying extra efforts like finding complex queries including multiple joins. More over, if an application uses decent object-oriented technologies, it allows a user to access whole aspects of data transparently. This paper describes the architecture of KIND (the system) and outlines our domain model. In this paper, we also describe a practical application of several object-oriented technologies to develop a next generation hospital information system.",

    "title": "Clinicians' perceptions of organizational readiness for change in the context of clinical information system projects: insights from two cross-sectional surveys.",
    "abstract": "The adoption and diffusion of clinical information systems has become one of the critical benchmarks for achieving several healthcare organizational reform priorities, including home care, primary care, and integrated care networks. However, these systems are often strongly resisted by the same community that is expected to benefit from their use. Prior research has found that early perceptions and beliefs play a central role in shaping future attitudes and behaviors such as negative rumors, lack of involvement, and resistance to change. In this line of research, this paper builds on the change management and information systems literature and identifies variables associated with clinicians' early perceptions of organizational readiness for change in the specific context of clinical information system projects. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted to test our research model. First, a questionnaire was pretested and then distributed to the future users of a mobile computing technology in 11 home care organizations. The second study took place in a large teaching hospital that had approved a budget for the acquisition of an electronic medical records system. Data analysis was performed using partial least squares. Scale items used in this study showed adequate psychometric properties. In Study 1, four of the hypothesized links in the research model were supported, with change appropriateness, organizational flexibility, vision clarity, and change efficacy explaining 75% of the variance in organizational readiness. In Study 2, four hypotheses were also supported, two of which differed from those supported in Study 1: the presence of an effective project champion and collective self-efficacy. In addition to these variables, vision clarity and change appropriateness also helped explain 75% of the variance in the dependent variable. Explanations for the similarities and differences observed in the two surveys are provided. Organizational readiness is arguably a key factor involved in clinicians' initial support for clinical information system initiatives. As healthcare organizations continue to invest in information technologies to improve quality and continuity of care and reduce costs, understanding the factors that influence organizational readiness for change represents an important avenue for future research.",

    "title": "A Web Geographic Information System to share data and explorative analysis tools: The application to West Nile disease in the Mediterranean basin.",
    "abstract": "In the last decades an increasing number of West Nile Disease cases was observed in equines and humans in the Mediterranean basin and surveillance systems are set up in numerous countries to manage and control the disease. The collection, storage and distribution of information on the spread of the disease becomes important for a shared intervention and control strategy. To this end, a Web Geographic Information System has been developed and disease data, climatic and environmental remote sensed data, full genome sequences of selected isolated strains are made available. This paper describes the Disease Monitoring Dashboard (DMD) web system application, the tools available for the preliminary analysis on climatic and environmental factors and the other interactive tools for epidemiological analysis. WNV occurrence data are collected from multiple official and unofficial sources. Whole genome sequences and metadata of WNV strains are retrieved from public databases or generated in the framework of the Italian surveillance activities. Climatic and environmental data are provided by NASA website. The Geographical Information System is composed by Oracle 10g Database and ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.03; the web mapping client application is developed with the ArcGIS API for Javascript and Phylocanvas library to facilitate and optimize the mash-up approach. ESRI ArcSDE 10.1 has been used to store spatial data. The DMD application is accessible through a generic web browser at https://netmed.izs.it/networkMediterraneo/. The system collects data through on-line forms and automated procedures and visualizes data as interactive graphs, maps and tables. The spatial and temporal dynamic visualization of disease events is managed by a time slider that returns results on both map and epidemiological curve. Climatic and environmental data can be associated to cases through python procedures and downloaded as Excel files. The system compiles multiple datasets through user-friendly web tools; it integrates entomological, veterinary and human surveillance, molecular information on pathogens and environmental and climatic data. The principal result of the DMD development is the transfer and dissemination of knowledge and technologies to develop strategies for integrated prevention and control measures of animal and human diseases.",

    "abstract": "is to develop additional analytical modules of geoinformation software complex on current infectious and parasitic diseases aimed to improve the quality of epidemiological monitoring and to generate a database on the trends of epidemical process development in the subjects of the Russian Federation. Additional analytical blocks on comparative and dynamic analysis of morbidity by the groups of nosologies were developed using the software meeting the general concept of the software complex (JavaScript, PHP, and others) and integrated into a new version of the Web application \"Epidemiological Atlas of Russia. Territory of the Federal District\". The initial data including information by the groups of diseases were converted into a set of interrelated tables with their further integration into the database of a new version of the Atlas under the control of a free relational MySQL database management system. The existing classifications of nosologic forms and the search for additional characteristics, potentially forming the groups of nosologies, have been analyzed and the current database of the Epidemiological Atlas has been optimized. The algorithms for obtaining and evaluating epidemiological indicators in the new analytical blocks for estimating cumulative morbidity by the nosologic groups were designed. There were created original analytical modules \"Comparative analysis of morbidity by the groups of nosologies\" and \"Dynamic analysis of morbidity by the groups of nosologies\" for the Web application \"Epidemiological Atlas of Russia. Territory of Federal District\" for the comparative and dynamic morbidity analysis based on the groups of nosologies in the administrative-territorial subject units, in the district subjects, and in the district as a whole, with the possibility of information detailing. The materials based on the database queries contain temporal (calendar month) and spatial detailing (administrative-territory unit of the Russian Federation subject). All materials may be exported as tables, graphs, or maps in various formats (.xls, .pdf, .csv, .png, .jpeg, .svg). Since the databases of the current epidemiological atlases of the Volga Federal District and Russia are universal, the mechanisms of processing tables and queries are identical providing the possibility of using the developed approaches employed in the Epidemiological Atlas of Russia or atlases of other federal districts in case of replicating a new Web application version. New analytical blocks may extend notions on the incidence of current infectious diseases and reveal characteristic regional features, facilitate more exact scientifically grounded proposals for decision-making by the executive authorities and timely taking preventive and anti-epidemic measures. The developed analytical modules integrated into the new version of the \"Epidemiological Atlas of Russia, Territory of the Federal District\" were designed to extend the analytical capabilities of the geoinformation software complex. They are characterized by a high significance in optimization and quality improvement of epidemiological monitoring, operative and retrospective epidemiological analysis of current infectious and parasitic diseases in a separate subject, a federal district, and the Russian Federation as a whole, and represent an essential potential for further improvement of analytical methods and technologies.",

In view of the recurrent weaknesses in preparedness and response during the management of epidemics, we have examined the organization and functioning of the health information system in Burkina Faso. We conducted a cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 including a review of HIS documents, key informant interviews and direct observations. The study was conducted at the public primary health care (PHC) and community level of Bama and Soumagou, in the rural health districts of Dandé and Tenkodogo. Study participants included community-based health workers (CBHWs) and health workers in the PHC areas, community-based organization animators (CBOAs), CBO monitoring-evaluation officers and members of the District management team (DMT). While reporting forms used in all health facilities are standardized, they are not necessarily well understood at community level and at the health centers. Reports prepared by CBHWs are often delayed by the head nurse at the primary health care service. Case definitions of epidemic diseases are not always well understood by community-based health workers and front-line health workers. The health information system in Burkina Faso can be improved using simple strategies. There is a need to hold regular training/refresher sessions for agents involved in surveillance and to ensure the development of simplified case definitions for emerging diseases and/or diseases of public health interest for community use. Furthermore, existing epidemic management committees need to be revitalized.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess what impacts on organized mosquito control the implementation of an Endangered Species Protection Program for the Houston toad might have in Chambers and Harris counties, Texas. The study was also intended to demonstrate the value of using geographic information system (GIS) techniques and methodologies in making such assessments to those in mosquito control who are unfamiliar with GIS and its applications. Using the GIS, Geographical Analysis Support System (GRASS), databases were developed on the habitats and patterns of mosquito control insecticide usage occurring in Chambers and Harris counties. These databases were then employed by means of various utilities associated with GRASS and computer-supported, rule-based reasoning processes to create maps depicting the amount and locations of toad habitat and the areas treated annually with insecticides by districts in Chambers and Harris counties. This map information was then used via other GRASS utilities to identify and depict zones of overlap or coincidence between toad habitat and areas treated with insecticides for mosquito control in the 2 counties. As compared to existing maps for toad habitat, our resulting GIS-generated maps gave more precise, easy-to-use information that could be used to make decisions as to how to protect the toad in the zones of coincidence in each county without causing undue disruption to mosquito control activities in these zones.",

At the neurology department of the Maastricht University Hospital, coordination and communication of the multidisciplinary team for stroke patients is intended to be supported by an EPR. Existing, structured, paper nursing and medical records served as a starting point for the development of the EPR. In close cooperation with future users, the database structure, and data entry and data retrieval aspects of the user interface were adapted to the domain of stroke. The result is a combined electronic medical and nursing record that has potential to improve record keeping and to truly support daily routines. The challenges encountered in the development process were maintaining continuous user involvement and conflicting points of view regarding the relevance of clinical data. Conclusively, we state that intensive user participation improved the EPR, coupling with the existing hospital information system and other systems will be advantageous and the fact that the paper records were structured in advance will smooth the unavoidable changes in work patterns.",

However, their systematic evaluation needs to implement economic evaluation models that can help decision makers to determine a feasible and suitable analysis of the impact of an information system in the appropriate healthcare setting [2]. Aim of this paper is to define a mathematical model to provide an \"ex-ante\" measure of adequacy and significance in the adoption process of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs). In particular, the model establishes how different subjects (General Practitioners, GPs and patients) are involved in the testing process and how the resources provided can be invested to find out the most suitable intervention strategies.",

    "title": "A requirements index for information processing in hospitals.",
    "abstract": "Reference models describing typical information processing requirements in hospitals do not currently exist. This leads to high hospital information system (HIS) management expenses, for example, during tender processes for the acquisition of software application programs. Our aim was, therefore, to develop a comprehensive, lasting, technology-independent, and sufficiently detailed index of requirements for information processing in hospitals in order to reduce respective expenses. Two-dozen German experts established an index of requirements for information processing in university hospitals. This was done in a consensus-based, top-down, cyclic manner. Each functional requirement was derived from information processing functions and sub-functions of a hospital. The result is the first official German version of a requirements index, containing 233 functional requirements and 102 function-independent requirements, focusing on German needs. The functional requirements are structured according to the primary care process from admission to discharge and supplemented by requirements for handling patient records, work organization and resource planning, hospital management, research and education. Both the German version and its English translation are available in the Internet. The index of requirements contains general information processing requirements in hospitals which are formulated independent of information processing tools, or of HIS architectures. It aims at supporting HIS management, especially HIS strategic planning, HIS evaluation, and tender processes. The index can be regarded as a draft, which must, however, be refined according to the specific aims of a particular project. Although focused on German needs, we expect that it can also be useful in other countries. The high amount of interest shown for the index supports its usefulness.",

    "abstract": "Although use of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is widespread and guidelines for use have been disseminated, actual practice patterns of medical oncologists are unknown. The purpose of this study was to collect these data using an office-based computerized clinical information system. Data were collected on patients at 10 community-based oncology practices. Information regarding CSF use was captured at the time of prescribing through a computerized clinical support tool and stored in a data warehouse, and an analysis was carried out retrospectively. A total of 6,813 cancer regimens administered to 5,034 patients were evaluated for growth factor use. Overall, CSFs were used in 14% of regimens, with breast, lymphoma, lung, and ovarian being the most common cancers for which CSFs were used. In 49.4% of regimens, CSF was initiated during cycle 1, with an average duration of 1 week, and was used in two or three cycles per regimen. Afebrile neutropenia is rarely followed by CSF initiation. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is associated with fewer dose adjustments, delays, and hospitalizations when compared with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). There is wide variation among oncologists in CSF use, and several substantial differences were noted between the prescribing behavior of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) survey-reported oncologists and actual clinical practice, as captured by the computerized clinical information system. Computerized clinical information systems can collect detailed information regarding practice patterns of medical oncologists. ASCO physician practice survey data do not accurately reflect actual practice patterns and must be interpreted with caution. Substantial deviations from ASCO growth factor guidelines remain, and oncologists' use of CSFs demonstrates wide variation. There may be important clinical differences between G-CSF and GM-CSF, but definitive phase III trials are needed for confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Modern Web-based Information Systems (WIS) are becoming increasingly necessary to provide support for users who are in different places with different types of information, by facilitating their access to the information, decision making, workgroups, and so forth. Design of these systems requires the use of standardized methods and techniques that enable a common vocabulary to be defined to represent the underlying knowledge. Thus, mediation elements such as traders enrich the interoperability of web components in open distributed systems. These traders must operate with other third-party traders and/or agents in the system, which must also use a common vocabulary for communication between them. This paper presents the OntoTrader architecture, an Ontological Web Trading agent based on the OMG ODP trading standard. It also presents the ontology needed by some system agents to communicate with the trading agent and the behavioral framework for the SOLERES OntoTrader agent, an Environmental Management Information System (EMIS). This framework implements a \"Query-Searching/Recovering-Response\" information retrieval model using a trading service, SPARQL notation, and the JADE platform. The paper also presents reflection, delegation and, federation mediation models and describes formalization, an experimental testing environment in three scenarios, and a tool which allows our proposal to be evaluated and validated.",

    "abstract": "In today's data-intensive work environments, information systems are crucial for supporting workers. However, workers often do not rely on these systems but resort to workarounds. We argue that trust is essential for workers' reliance on information systems, positively affecting workers' cognitive resources, performance, and well-being. Moreover, we argue that the organisational context (accountability, distractions) and user-related factors qualify trust-outcome associations by affecting workers' trust calibration. In a preregistered study, we asked = 291 employed users of information systems to re-experience prior everyday usage events (event reconstruction method) and assess event-specific trust in the system, work outcomes, and context conditions. Results confirmed the assumed association between trust in the information system and workers' ratings of both performance and well-being. Moreover, workers' technology competence and need for cognition - but not contextual conditions - qualified trust-outcome associations. Our results offer specific suggestions for achieving successful use of information systems at work.",

JointCalc, the first comprehensive patient-facing web-based decision support tool for joint replacement, is used as a case study for this purpose. User-centred design and thorough end-user involvement are employed throughout the design and development of JointCalc. This is supported by modern software production paradigms, including continuous integration/continuous development, agile and service-oriented architecture. The adopted methods result in a user-approved application delivered well within the scope of project. This work supports the claims of high potential efficiency of HIS.

    "abstract": "Needs Based Assessment of Trauma Systems 2 (NBATS-2) attempts to predict the impact on patient volume and travel time for patients when a new trauma center (TC) is added to the system. The purpose of this study was to examine NBATS-2 predictive accuracy regarding expected volume and travel times of trauma patients at a newly designated TC and nearby legacy TCs when compared with actual data. Needs Based Assessment of Trauma Systems predictive model for volume of trauma patients at the new TC was run based on 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of both state and National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) patients per 100 TC beds. This was compared with the actual number of trauma patients from the State Discharge Data set before (2011-2012) and after (2016-2017) designation of the TC. Analysis was then augmented using the geographic information system (ArcGIS) spatial modeling to characterize median travel times for actual trauma patients, before and after designation of the TC. Both state and NTDB 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles resulted in significant overestimation of volume at the new TC in 2016. After another year of TC maturation (2017), overestimation decreased but was still present. The 25th percentile from state and NTDB data sets provided the most accurate predictions. For the legacy TCs, the model switched from under to overestimation as the state and NTDB percentiles increased. The geographic information system accurately showed patients traveling <40 minutes to a TC nearly doubled. Needs Based Assessment of Trauma Systems 2 provides an excellent template for state strategic planning; however, it overestimates new TC volume and under/overestimates volumes for legacy TCs depending on the state and NTDB percentiles used. This study shows that population density of the county in which the new or legacy TC is located should be considered when choosing the appropriate state or NTDB percentile. The geographic information system appropriately showed a decrease in trauma patient travel times after TC designation. Care Management, level V.",

One barrier is the lack of information evaluating the potential costs of connecting these local networks to form a national network. The Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL), in conjunction with national experts, developed assumptions around the components needed to develop the NHIN. These assumptions were largely based on the architectural approach suggested by the Connecting for Health Common Framework for such a network. Using these assumptions, CITL collected cost data from three different markets engaging in healthcare information exchange (HIE). These costs were then extrapolated to the nation based on population density data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The CITL model projected an initial deployment cost of $97 million and an annual maintenance cost of $41 million for HIE across the NHIN.",

We explain that the fragmented nature of the conservative healthcare system, the contradictory incentives and improper outcome measures conspire to make the innovative adoption of mobile technology problematic. Researchers can only gain a limited understanding of a technology's potential success by using technology adoption frameworks and need to supplement this with a 'systems' perspective that takes a more strategic view.",

    "title": "Nurses' Satisfaction With Using Nursing Information Systems From Technology Acceptance Model and Information Systems Success Model Perspectives: A Reductionist Approach.",
    "abstract": "Nursing information systems can enhance nursing practice and the efficiency and quality of administrative affairs within the nursing department and thus have been widely considered for implementation. Close alignment of human-computer interaction can advance optimal clinical performance with the use of information systems. However, a lack of introduction of the concept of alignment between users' perceptions and technological functionality has caused dissatisfaction, as shown in the existing literature. This study provides insight into the alignment between nurses' perceptions and how technological functionality affects their satisfaction with Nursing Information System use through a reductionist perspective of alignment. This cross-sectional study collected data from 531 registered nurses in Taiwan. The results indicated that \"perceived usefulness in system quality alignment,\" \"perceived usefulness in information quality alignment,\" \"perceived ease of use in system quality alignment,\" \"perceived ease of use in information quality alignment,\" and \"perceived ease of use in service quality alignment\" have significantly affected nurses' satisfaction with Nursing Information System use. However, \"perceived usefulness in service quality alignment\" had no significant effect on nurses' satisfaction. This study also provides some meaningful implications for theoretical and practical aspects of design.",

    "abstract": "Research carried out by nurses or by others on patient problems of concern to nurses is contributing to the development of evidence-based nursing practice. In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in clinical research, in health services research, and in the content and process of informatics, all focused on nursing care. The translation of findings of this research into clinical practice and the organization of nursing is less dramatic. The opportunity to implement research-based practice is great, but requires attention, methods, and resources. Also required are a database and an information system which include terms essential to nursing practice. DIMENSIONS OF NURSES' INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE: The importance of nurses' involvement in evidence-based practice (EBP) can be viewed from three perspectives: (1) nurses' participation in medical problems and medical interventions, (2) nursing problems and nursing interventions, and (3) development and use of a standardized language that describes the problems, interventions, and outcomes important to nursing. The best outcomes for a specific patient population are achieved through a combination of the medical and nursing problems and evidence-based interventions. Examples of problems of importance to nursing practice and research include pain, dehydration, incontinence, lifestyle change, confusion, immobility, knowledge deficit, noncompliance, anxiety, skin breakdown, inappropriate use of restraints, and falls. Interventions for prevention and treatment of the individual problem or combination of problems comprise the focus of nursing research and EBP.",

    "abstract": "The effective evaluation of the usability of health information systems is currently a major challenge. It is essential that the applications we develop are not only usable, but that they are also shown to be safe and do not inadvertently introduce errors. Furthermore, to provide appropriate feedback to designers of systems new methods for evaluation are needed as applications become more complex and distributed. To ensure system usability and safety a variety of methods have emerged from the area of usability engineering that have been adapted to healthcare. The authors have applied and adapted methods of usability engineering, working with hospitals and other healthcare organizations for designing and evaluating a range of health information systems over a number of years. We describe a methodological framework for considering some of these advances and show how a range of usability evaluations can be used to evaluate both the usability and safety of healthcare information systems both in artificial mocked up and real clinical settings using in-situ testing approaches. We conclude with a discussion of recent trends in the area of usability engineering in healthcare that have potential for improving the safety of healthcare information systems.",

    "abstract": "Sanitary landfill remains the most common methodology for final treatment and disposal of municipal solid waste worldwide, the cost per tonne depends on its scale. The bigger the landfill, the cheaper the cost of treatment, so the consortium of municipalities is the solution to achieve an economic scale. However, the growth of waste production introduces pressure for adequate solutions and therefore has been increasing sanitary landfill site selection studies. This study proposes a methodology for siting sanitary landfills and optimising the transport of municipal solid waste for a locality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Environmental, social, and economic criteria were established. Their correlated attributes were categorised into suitability levels and weighted according to multiple decision analysis. The data were organised and mapped within a geographic information system. Considering sites where landfills are prohibited, two scenarios were generated. The Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming mathematical model is used to minimise the costs of transporting municipal solid waste and operating sanitary landfills. In Scenario 1, the results indicated that 64% of the area was suitable as a potential sanitary landfill site, 9% of the area exhibited medium suitability, and 27% of the area was classified as restricted. In Scenario 2, the results indicated that 25% of the area was suitable as a potential sanitary landfill site, 4% of the area had medium suitability, and 71% of the area was classified as restricted. The optimal solutions for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 enabled sites to be determined for five landfills and four landfills, respectively.",

This study aimed to evaluate the implementation impact of the new information system on records of physicians' and nurses' patient care and home visits of community health workers (CHW) in Brazil from 2007 to 2019. To this end, a Bayesian structural time-series model approach was used, based on a diffuse state-space regression. From 2016 to 2019, 463.47 million physician care, 210.61 million nursing care, and 1.28 billion CHW visits were recorded. Following the trend recorded before the implementation, 598.86 million, 430.46 million, and 1.5 billion physician and nursing appointments and CHW visits would be expected, respectively. In relative terms, there was a decrease of 25% in physician care, 51% in nursing care, and 15% in CHW visits when compared to the value expected by the Bayesian method. The negative impact on the records of patient care and home visits identified in this study, whether due to difficulties in adapting to the new system or a reduction in improper records, must be investigated so that the challenge of improving the primary care information system can be understood and overcome in a planned way.",

Major obstacles to the implementation of an effective health information system regarding dengue cases in Bandung are examined, and practical suggestions on measures to overcome them are discussed. The study utilized a mixed-method research design using qualitative approaches: document analysis, key informants and focus group interviews. Thirty key informants were selected, comprised of policymakers, senior managers, and staff at the Ministry of Health. Data from documents and transcripts were evaluated through a modified Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework described by Ostrom. Through this study, we have identified several issues that hinder the effective implementation of the health information system in the case of dengue in Bandung. In the end, we propose several recommendations for reform that encompasses motivational, strategic, and structural approaches to each component of the analysis. Through evaluation of the health information system for dengue surveillance in Indonesia, we conclude that well-coordination in multi-level governance in a country as large as Indonesia is the key in the implementation of the health information system in different levels of agencies. Furthermore, the adaptability of human resources in adopting a new information system also plays an important part.",

    "abstract": "The construction and analysis of protein databases using the QUEST system is described, and the REF52 protein database is presented. A protein database provides the means to store and compare quantitative and descriptive data for up to 2000 proteins from many experiments that employ computer-analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The QUEST system provides the tools to manage, analyze, and communicate these data. The REF52 database contains experiments with normal and transformed rat cell lines. In this report, many of the proteins on the REF52 map are identified by name, by subcellular localization, and by mode of post-translational modification. The quantitative experiments analyzed and compared here include 1) a study of the quantitative reproducibility of the analysis system, 2) a study of the clonal reproducibility of REF52 cells, 3) a study of growth-related changes in REF52 cells, and 4) a study of the effects of labeling cells for varying lengths of time. Of the proteins analyzed from REF52 cells, 10% are nuclear, 6% are phosphoproteins, and 4% are mannose-labeled glycoproteins. The mannose-labeled proteins are more prominent in patterns from quiescent cells, while the synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins is generally repressed at quiescence. A small set of proteins, selected for elevated rates of synthesis is generally repressed at quiescence. A small set of proteins, selected for elevated rates of synthesis in quiescent versus proliferating cells includes one of the tropomyosin isoforms, a myosin light chain isoform, and several prominent glycoproteins. These proteins are thought to be characteristic of the differentiated state of untransformed REF52 cells. Proteins induced early versus late after refeeding quiescent cells show very different patterns of growth regulation. These studies lay the foundations of the REF52 database and provide information needed to interpret the experiments with transformed REF52 cells, which are reported in the accompanying paper (Garrels, J., and Franza, B. R., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5299-5312).",

This deficiency has resulted in a quest for and consideration of models, metaphors, and mind maps for the Healthcare Professional Workstation (HPW)--the access mechanism for the CPR and the CIS. The familiar physician desktop and traditional paper-based metaphors are not adequate for all aspects of clinical information processes. In the clinical care environment, the flowsheet is a transporting metaphor because many different applications and tasks can be 'transported' into the flowsheet. 3D Rooms, Gopher and Genes are familiar and transporting metaphors to be exploited for HPWs. Using transporting metaphors for HPW software emphasizes commonality and de-emphasizes diversity. Each model and metaphor has an associated mind map. Only the mental model, mental metaphor or mind map for HPW software is important. Metaphors communicate real-world analogies, and communication is at the core of what defines usability. A mind map facilitates communication by building a model in the user's mind. The barriers to HPWs are not technical; they are related to economics, ownership of patient information, liability and information standards.",

The aim of this work is to describe the ECHO information system that was developed at Timone Hospital (France) for the monitoring and evaluation of dental student activity and to present the results of a qualitative evaluation of student perceptions of this system. According to the analysis of the UML model of care-related procedures and data, the pre-existing process of student evaluation was characterized by redundancy between administrative and educational data. ECHO was developed in PHP/MySQL and designed to centralize the two types of data in a unified computerized process. The qualitative evaluation of dental student perceptions of ECHO was performed using an anonymous online Google Form questionnaire. Among the respondents (102/254 students), 96% stated that ECHO is easy to use, 86% that it saves time, and 81% that it gives them a better overview of their activity. After several years of use, ECHO has solved many of the difficulties related to the use of internship paper booklets, while also providing a documentary database of the activities of our dental department. The student activity data stored in ECHO are directly accessible by faculty members and can be reused to facilitate departmental management and research and to improve patient follow-up.",

Through a systematic analysis of the opinions and valuations of public health stakeholders, this study aims to conceptualize key features of an EU-HISys. Public health professionals and policymakers were invited to participate in a concept mapping procedure. First, participants (N = 34) formulated statements that reflected their vision of an EU-HISys. Second, participants (N = 28) rated the relative importance of each statement and grouped conceptually similar ones. Principal Component and cluster analyses were used to condense these results to EU-HISys key features in a concept map. The number of key features and the labelling of the concept map were determined by expert consensus. The concept map contains 10 key features that summarize 93 statements. The map consists of a horizontal axis that represents the relevance of an 'organizational strategy', which deals with the 'efforts' to design and develop an EU-HISys and the 'achievements' gained by a functioning EU-HISys. The vertical axis represents the 'professional orientation' of the EU-HISys, ranging from the 'scientific' through to the 'policy' perspective. The top ranking statement expressed the need to establish a system that is permanent and sustainable. The top ranking key feature focuses on data and information quality. This study provides insights into key features of an EU-HISys. The results can be used to guide future planning and to support the development of a health information system for Europe.",

    "abstract": "The interconnection of integrated health sciences library systems with other health sciences computer systems to achieve information networks will require either custom linkages among specific devices or the adoption of standards that all systems support. The most appropriate standards appear to be those being developed under the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model, which specifies a set of rules and functions that computers must follow to exchange information. The protocols have been modularized into seven different layers. The lowest three layers are generally available as off-the-shelf interfacing products. The higher layers require special development for particular applications. This paper describes the OSI, its application in health sciences networks, and specific tasks that remain to be undertaken.",

    "abstract": "A central duty of the laboratory is to inform clinicians about the availability and usefulness of laboratory testing. In this report, we describe a new class of laboratory middleware that connects the traditional clinical laboratory information system with the rest of the enterprise, facilitating information flow about testing services. We demonstrate the value of this approach in efficiently supporting an inpatient order entry application. We also show that order entry monitoring and iterative middleware updates can enhance ordering efficiency and promote improved ordering practices. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of algorithmic approaches to improve the accuracy and completeness of laboratory test searches. We conclude with a discussion of design recommendations for middleware applications and discuss the potential role of middleware as a sharable, centralized repository of laboratory test information.",

It was compiled to compliment a monograph produced in June 1995 on Nursing Information Systems. The paper summarises the structure of the monograph and outlines the concept of benefits realisation. The examples featured in the monograph are not \"true\" benefits realisation studies and many of the accounts are anecdotal in nature. However, the paper suggests that midwives do benefit from using a maternity information system particularly in the areas of auditing practice, effortless retrieval of statistics, less duplication of data entry, summaries of care and research purposes. Managers also benefit from some of these functions and those relating to estimating workload and allocation of resources. It is suggested that any benefits for staff and management should also benefit clients and improve the provision of the maternity services.",

    "abstract": "As laboratories in the United States convert to reporting test results in Système International (SI) units, certain requirements will be placed on laboratory computers. Old and new results must be related to different reference ranges. Interpretive reporting and reflexive testing algorithms must be updated to the new units. Reporting in minimum increments is worthwhile, regardless of the SI conversion timetable. On the other hand, dual reporting is not advisable, as it would clutter reports and increase the cost and complexity of SI conversion, without yielding benefits. Results should be converted to SI units at the instrument, not by the computer. The Greek mu (mu) may be represented as u. Conversion graphs can be printed on the unused reverse side of report forms. The most important factors in the success of conversion to SI reporting will be thorough education of those reading the reports, and coordination of the conversion process within each locality.",

In the clinical setting, availability of needed information can be crucial during the decision-making process. Preliminary studies performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) determined that there are inadequate access to information and ineffective communication among clinicians (potential proximal causes of medical errors). In response to these findings, the authors have been developing extensions to their Web-based clinical information system including PalmCIS, an application that provides access to needed patient information via a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA). The focus was on achieving end-to-end security and developing a highly usable system. This report discusses the motivation behind PalmCIS, design and development of the system, and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Solutions to straightforward resource management problems need not always involve the use of complex, specialised and expensive software solutions. Commercially available 'off the shelf' packages have increased in flexibility and ease of use, and are usually an order of magnitude cheaper than their custom designed counterparts. In response to a request for a low cost database suitable to be used on a stand-alone microcomputer system, the widely available integrated software package Smart was used. The program specification required quantification and analysis of the workload in a medium sized operating theatre suite (at 6,000 cases/year) to be undertaken. In addition to providing Database, Spreadsheet and Wordprocessor modules, each with rapid and easy exchange of data from one module to another, Smart incorporates its own programming language. This may be used to build up complex series of instructions for data manipulation, to generate menus and create a naive user front end to the finished program. Although an adequate knowledge of database construction and basic programming are necessary, professional programming skills are not required. NOTIS, the Newham Operating Theatre Information System, is a menu driven program designed to be used by clerical staff, and accepting patient data derived from within the operating theatre. At the end of each month a set of predetermined reports are produced. These reports are designed to provide information on the workload, case type and medical personnel involvement applicable to theatre managers, anaesthetists and surgical staff.",

    "abstract": "The use of health information systems (HIS) can result in high workloads and, consequently, poor performance characterized by e.g. increased occurrence of errors among clinicians. Pupillometry offers a good possibility to measure mental workload in a dynamic work setting. Currently, there is a lack of empirical research in the context of healthcare settings. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether specific eye movement measures are suitable for measuring mental workload in the healthcare setting, especially when working with HIS. 49 persons participated in our simulation-lab study. They had to complete a system-related task as well as an increasing n-back task. Both tasks were modified regarding task difficulty. Results show significant differences for objective and subjective workload measures between increasing task levels. There are also hints for an overload/fatigue indicator in pupil data. Our results are limited in terms of external validity, causality and effects. Future work should focus on high-fidelity simulations and less time-consuming analysis approaches.",

Case study of Priority Health, a Michigan managed care organization, to investigate use of IIS data for Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) compliance, quality measurement, and a provider incentive program. Primary data were collected through key informant interviews and group discussions with Priority Health and IIS managers. Priority Health's information systems were populated with claims data and supplemental data, before chart reviews, to simulate immunization and health plan quality measures for 2004 to 2007 in the absence of IIS data. Simulated rates were compared with historical rates that included IIS data. The study included a cost-benefit analysis. For 2007, IIS data increased observed immunization rates from 6.49 to 54.13 percentage points for childhood immunizations and 57.63 to 77.97 percentage points for adolescent immunizations. The HEDIS administrative rate for childhood immunizations doubled from 43.38% in 2003 to 88.08% in 2007. The most significant source of savings was in administration of the health plan's Physician Incentive Program, which saw 18,881 fewer chart reviews from 2004 to 2007 when IIS data were used compared with when they were not used. Total costs of using IIS data were estimated to be $14,318 and net benefits were $107,854 -- corresponding to a benefit-to-cost ratio of 8.06. Health plans using a state IIS as a single point of data entry may realize cost savings and have improved assurance of immunization coverage.",

    "title": "Toward an Agile System: Iranian Information System for Covid-19-Affected Patients Data Collection from Iranian Hospitals.",
    "abstract": "COVID-19's rapid spreads has caused a global pandemic. On 19th February 2020, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of infections in Qom City and the number of diagnosed cases and the death toll rose exponentially in March [1-3]. Managing the disease, which is considered a pandemic according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [4], requires definite approaches differing according to various factors in each country, which may also lead to (in)effective dealing with the disease. In addition, using international data and information, and WHO advice, especially in the crisis and therapeutic procedures, is one of the best crisis management strategies [5]. For every plan by governances, the first step is collecting information on epidemic distribution for the purpose of isolating provinces and cities at a national scale. Thus, Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran (MOHME) attempted to collect the minimum required data on the infection-affected patients based on medical records and epidemiological factors, such as demographic data (gender, age and national code), exposure history (close contact with the infected, suspect patients or even having traveled) and signs and symptoms (fever, cough, shortness or difficulties in breathing, fatigue, anorexia, hemoptysis, sputum production, dyspnea, Myalgia, Pharyngalgia, nausea, vomiting, Diarrhea, Headache, Abdominal pain, Dizziness, etc.). Therefore, to ensure accuracy and validity, and to speed up data collection in an area, Information Technology (IT) tools were required [6]. In this regard, developing an information system with a simple format and user-friendly interface in the shortest possible time was the aim. This study presents the local information system developed in March 2020, which has been registering hospitalized Covide-19-affected patients in Iranian hospitals up till now. In other words, this paper introduces features and procedures of one of the national systems as a health registry that includes clinical information on admitted Covid-19 patients in Iranian hospitals from admission to discharge or death. This system is supported by MOHME, and along with outpatient Point of Care Information Systems (POCS), feeds the national and international pandemic reports and decisions.",

The resources range from local documents, to commercially available document sets and search engines. The links provided by the IM can be reliably created, but there is no guarantee that they will function reliably, since the resources to which they point are subject to unannounced changes and failures. We have developed a set of tools to audit the links periodically to determine if the resources are available and if the IM has sufficient information to generate all the links needed by its users. These tools have been in use since February, 2006 and have provided timely warnings on many occasions. These warnings have allowed us to correct problems with resource access before they became apparent to our users and often before the resource maintainers were aware of the problems. The tools have thus helped us provide clinicians with a dependable level of service.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of clinicians' use of an online information retrieval system on their performance in answering clinical questions. Pre-/post-intervention experimental design. In a computer laboratory, 75 clinicians (26 hospital-based doctors, 18 family practitioners, and 31 clinical nurse consultants) provided 600 answers to eight clinical scenarios before and after the use of an online information retrieval system. We examined the proportion of correct answers pre- and post-intervention, direction of change in answers, and differences between professional groups. System use resulted in a 21% improvement in clinicians' answers, from 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.4-32.6) correct pre- to 50% (95% CI 46.0-54.0) post-system use. In 33% (95% CI 29.1-36.9) answers were changed from incorrect to correct. In 21% (95% CI 17.1-23.9) correct pre-test answers were supported by evidence found using the system, and in 7% (95% CI 4.9-9.1) correct pre-test answers were changed incorrectly. For 40% (35.4-43.6) of scenarios, incorrect pre-test answers were not rectified following system use. Despite significant differences in professional groups' pre-test scores [family practitioners: 41% (95% CI 33.0-49.0), hospital doctors: 35% (95% CI 28.5-41.2), and clinical nurse consultants: 17% (95% CI 12.3-21.7; chi(2) = 29.0, df = 2, p < 0.01)], there was no difference in post-test scores. (chi(2) = 2.6, df = 2, p = 0.73). The use of an online information retrieval system was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of answers provided by clinicians to typical clinical problems. In a small proportion of cases, use of the system produced errors. While there was variation in the performance of clinical groups when answering questions unaided, performance did not differ significantly following system use. Online information retrieval systems can be an effective tool in improving the accuracy of clinicians' answers to clinical questions.",

    "title": "Supporting clinical practice at the bedside using wireless technology.",
    "abstract": "Despite studies that show improvements in both standards of care and outcomes with the judicious application of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), their clinical utilization remains low. This randomized controlled trial examined the use of a wirelessly networked mobile computer (MC) by physicians at the bedside with access to an emergency department information system, decision support tools (DSTs), and other software options. Each of ten volunteer emergency physicians was randomized using a matched-pair design to work five shifts in standard fashion (desktop computer [DC] access) and five shifts with a wirelessly networked MC. Work pattern issues and electronic CPG/DST use were compared using end-of-shift satisfaction questionnaires and review of a CPG/DST database. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine between-shift differences. A total of 100 eight-hour shifts were evaluated; 99% compliance with postshift questionnaires was achieved. Using a seven-point Likert scale (MC values first), MCs were rated as being as fast (5.04 vs. 4.54; p=0.13) and convenient (5.08 vs. 4.14; p=0.07) as DCs. Overall, physicians rated MCs to be less efficient (3.18 vs. 4.30; p=0.02) but encouraged more frequent use of DSTs (4.10 vs. 3.47; p=0.03) without impacting doctor-patient communication (2.78 vs. 2.96; p=0.51). During the study period, physician use of an intranet Web application (eCPG) was more frequent during shifts assigned to the MC when compared with the DC (eCPG uses/shift, 3.6 vs. 2.0; p=0.033). The MC technology permitted physicians to access information at the bedside and increased the use of CPG/DST tools. According to physicians, patients appeared to accept their use of information technology to assist in decision making. Development of improved computer technology may address the major limitation of MC portability.",

To assess the knowledge of, attitude towards and use of an NIS. A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out among 230 hospital nurses in India, using a validated questionnaire including demographic characteristics, and questions on knowledge of, attitude towards and use of an NIS. The study found that more than 70% of nurses had good computer skills and knowledge about the information system. About 75% of the nurses reported that the NIS could be a tool to support them in improving patient care, and medical documentation, although 42% claimed that the use of NIS depersonalises nursing care. Seventy-one per cent of the nurses expressed the need for formal education and training on using an NIS during and after their nursing education. Training and demonstration of NISs during nurse education would improve nurses' knowledge, build confidence and positive attitudes, and enhance the acceptability and sustainability of NISs in healthcare settings.",

    "title": "Information management in the emergency department.",
    "abstract": "Information system planning for the ED is complex and new to emergency medicine, despite being used in other industries for many years. It has been estimated that less than 15% of EDs have comprehensive EDIS currently in place. The manner in which administration is approached in large part determines the success in obtaining appropriate institutional support for an EDIS. Active physician and nurse involvement is essential in the process if the new system is to be accepted at the user level. In the ED, large volumes of information are collected, collated,interpreted, and acted on immediately. Effective information management therefore is key to the successful operation of any ED. Although computerized information systems have tremendous potential for improving information management, such systems are often underused or implemented in such a way that they increase the workload on caregivers and staff. This is counter productive and should be avoided. In developing and implementing EDIS one should be careful not to automate poorly designed manual processes. Examples are ED tracking systems that require staff to manually relocate patients in the system. This task probably is completed only when the ED volume is low and \"worked around\" when the department is busy. Information from such a system is, therefore, flawed; at best useless and at worst counter productive. Alternatively, systems are available that can track patients automatically through the ED by way of infrared sensors similar to those used in baggage-tracking systems that have been in place in airports for years. In the automated (computerized) ED, we must have zero-fault-tolerant,enterprise-wide, hospital information networked systems that prevent unnecessary duplication of tasks, assist in tracking and entering data, and ultimately help analyze the information on a minute-to-minute basis. Such systems only reach their potential when they are fully integrated, including legacy systems, rather than stand alone proprietary EDIS. Further,a modular approach in which individual components are connected to a flexible computer backbone is ideal.Finally, good clinical content is key to virtually every aspect of the EDIS. Much of this content is yet to be developed and what is available still needs to be adapted to the EDIS environment. Daunting as it may be, an EDIS implementation properly accomplished results in better patient care, improved staff productivity, and a satisfying work environment (Box 3).",

Through the review process, conducted in 2007, it is evident that health promotion and public health applications of GIS can be generally categorized into four predominant themes: disease surveillance (n = 227), risk analysis (n = 189), health access and planning (n = 138), and community health profiling (n = 115). This review explores how GIS approaches have been used to inform decision making and discusses the extent to which GIS can be applied to address health promotion and public health questions. The contribution of this literature review will be to generate a broader understanding of how GIS-related methodological techniques and tools developed in other disciplines can be meaningfully applied to applications in public health policy, promotion, and practice.",

The adjusted R2 value of the prediction model was 0.93 for home-visit care, 0.87 for home-visit nursing, and 0.63 for home-visit bathing providers. The number of providers for home-visit care, home-visit nursing, and home-visit bathing were estimated to decrease by 67%, 67%, and 28%, respectively.

    "abstract": "An effective health management information system (HMIS) that captures accurate, consistent, and relevant data in a timely fashion can enable better planning and monitoring of health programs and improved service delivery, in turn helping increase the impact of different interventions. In 2009, the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) implemented HMIS, India's national-level health information platform. However, key challenges, including difficulties in accessing the data through a web-based portal and its limited relevance to decision making and managerial needs, reduced its usability at the district and state levels. In 2015, with the support of the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit, the GOUP created its own data platform, the Uttar Pradesh HMIS (UP-HMIS), to capture data elements missing from HMIS but important to UP decision makers. The UP-HMIS was redesigned to capture these data elements to holistically measure and monitor the performance of health programs and inform decision making at the district and state levels. In addition, the GOUP implemented complementary initiatives to improve data quality and data use processes. To improve HMIS data quality, the GOUP established data validation committee meetings at the block, district, and state levels. To promote the use of these validated data, in 2017, the GOUP developed and implemented the UP Health Dashboard, which ranks each of UP's 75 districts on a set of key HMIS priority health indicators. These policy guidelines have brought greater attention to UP-HMIS data quality and use; however, additional strengthening is required to improve the quality and use of HMIS data. There is a need to increase the overall capacity and understanding of HMIS data, not only for staff with specific data-related responsibilities but also for program managers and senior decision makers.",

The perceived CIS quality, usefulness and user satisfaction are significantly lower for medical professions than other professional groups. Continuance intention is very high within all professional subgroups. In a multiple regression analysis, the global satisfaction (R(2) = .780) was positively and significantly correlated with CIS quality, confirmation of expectations and perceived CIS usefulness. The continuance intention (R(2) = .392) was positively and significantly correlated with perceived CIS usefulness, confirmation of expectations and global satisfaction. In a late post-adoption CIS deployment phase, continuance intention does not significantly depend on individual end user characteristics but is significantly associated with the perceived CIS usefulness, confirmation of expectations and global satisfaction.",

In this paper, we report on the development of the Lightweight Authentication Protocol (LAP), which makes a mobile and distributed system more secure and flexible and we implement it in a Health Care Environment where the clinicians use mobile and wireless devices like PDAs. We also provide an indicative example of integrating the LAP with access control mechanisms. Context-based Team Access Control (C-TMAC) model is used in this example, since it provides great flexibility on user-permissions management in collaborative healthcare environments.

The 11th revision of the ICD (ICD-11) released by the World Health Organization provides stakeholders with novel perspectives on solving the complexity of critical problems in medical informatics. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of research published over the period of 1989-2018 to examine the development of ICD-related research and its trends. First, over 4000 ICD-related papers spanning the 30-year period are retrieved from the Web of Science database. Then, based on the meta data of the selected papers, time trend analysis is performed to examine the development of different ICD revisions. Finally, the keywords and topics of these papers are analyzed and visualized using VOSViewer and CiteSpace. Our findings indicate that ICD-11-related research has grown rapidly in recent years compared with studies on ICD-9 and ICD-10. Moreover, the most popular research directions of ICD-11 include the topics psychiatry, psychology, information science, library science, and behavioral science. In terms of perspectives, information system-related research is more common than big data- and knowledge discovery-related work. However, the popularity of big data- and knowledge discovery-related developments has grown in recent years. The use of ICD-11 facilitates the development of medical informatics from the perspectives of information systems, big data, and knowledge discovery.",

    "title": "Proposing a Model for the National Hemovigilance Information System in Iran.",
    "abstract": "The present study aimed to propose a model for the national hemovigilance information system with a database approach, considering the importance and necessity of developing an information system for such a network. This is an applied, descriptive, and cross-sectional study, which was conducted in 2018. The research population comprised hemovigilance information systems in advanced countries, including the USA, UK, Australia, and France. Data were collected from library sources and the Internet from 2000 to 2018. The proposed model for the national hemovigilance information system was introduced using comparative tables and based on the similarities and differences of systems in the studied countries. The proposed model was then validated using the two-step Delphi technique through a researcher-made questionnaire whose validity was confirmed, and reliability was approved by a Cronbach's alpha of 94%. The final model of the national hemovigilance information system comprised five main components: goals, organizations involved in the blood transfusion process, databases of blood transfusion organizations, data transfer flow between the databases of blood transfusion organizations, and transferable datasets, and hemovigilance-related committees. This model was approved by experts with an >85% agreement coefficient. The national hemovigilance information system with a database approach can improve blood transfusion health by providing access to reliable sources on blood transfusion complications to everyone, especially the medical community. Thus, it is essential to implement this standard accurately and precisely control the practical methods of this process based on international guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Data routinely collected through United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) lack the detailed information on medical resource utilization and treatment costs required to accomplish for center-level comparisons of quality of care and cost for pediatric heart transplantation. We aimed to overcome this limitation by merging UNOS with the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, an administrative database containing inpatient, emergency department, ambulatory surgery, and observation unit information from over 40 not-for-profit, tertiary care pediatric hospitals. Utilizing a probabilistic match based on center, date of birth, recipient gender, and transplant date within ±2 days, more than 90% of eligible UNOS patients (N = 2264) were successfully merged to their corresponding PHIS records. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality rates observed for the merged cohort (3.2% and 9.0%, respectively) were compared with those previously reported for pediatric heart transplants, as were the significant predictors of increased mortality. These results demonstrate that the established UNOS-PHIS cohort will provide a valid platform for subsequent research aimed at identifying center-level differences that could be exploited to optimize quality of care while minimizing cost across institutions.",

    "title": "Implementing the lifelong personal health record in a regionalised health information system: the case of Lombardy, Italy.",
    "abstract": "The use of personal health records (PHRs) can help people make better health decisions and improves the quality of care by allowing access to and use of the information needed to communicate effectively with others concerning their health care. This work presents the lifelong PHR system of the Lombardy region as an example of the implementation of an e-health solution that is capable of providing personal clinical documents from a lifelong perspective, integrating different healthcare providers over a large territory. The lifelong PHR is embedded in the regional healthcare information system of Lombardy, which is characterised by a large and heterogeneous territory, a large number of different healthcare providers and organisations, and a significant population. The lifelong PHR makes clinical documents available to healthcare professionals and citizens when needed, and it is automatically updated with all of the documents regarding a clinical event regardless of which healthcare provider is currently taking care of the patient. Present statistics show that the lifelong PHR has experienced a wide diffusion in a short period of time, and at the end of 2010, it was active for more than five million Lombardy citizens. Digital reports and e-prescription transactions have almost doubled since 2007 and have reached a coverage of almost 100%. The qualified and exhaustive collection of patient clinical data and documents should impact daily medical practice, as well as the care pathways and services provided to patients, and should help in the renewal of health assistance and the simplification of patients' access to care.",

The measurement accuracy was proved by WinDENDRO tree ring analysis system. The results showed that there was no significant difference between those two methods ( =0.63), and that the difference of paired mean value was 0.87 μm, indicating that the measured results were accurate and reliable. The constructed method in this study could be used to measure the spacing of tree ring, which lay the foundation for the automatic measurement of tree ring parameters such as area and perimeter. Our method could replace the current professional tree ring analysis system for some ring parameter measurement.

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support (CDS) systems provide clinicians and other health care stakeholders with patient-specific assessments or recommendations to aid in the clinical decision-making process. Despite their demonstrated potential for improving health care quality, the widespread availability of CDS systems has been limited mainly by the difficulty and cost of sharing CDS knowledge among heterogeneous healthcare information systems. The purpose of this study was to design and develop a sharable clinical decision support (S-CDS) system that meets this challenge. The fundamental knowledge base consists of independent and reusable knowledge modules (KMs) to meet core CDS needs, wherein each KM is semantically well defined based on the standard information model, terminologies, and representation formalisms. A semantic web service framework was developed to identify, access, and leverage these KMs across diverse CDS applications and care settings. The S-CDS system has been validated in two distinct client CDS applications. Model-level evaluation results confirmed coherent knowledge representation. Application-level evaluation results reached an overall accuracy of 98.66 % and a completeness of 96.98 %. The evaluation results demonstrated the technical feasibility and application prospect of our approach. Compared with other CDS engineering efforts, our approach facilitates system development and implementation and improves system maintainability, scalability and efficiency, which contribute to the widespread adoption of effective CDS within the healthcare domain.",

    "abstract": "New functions have been integrated in the Giessen Hospital Information System WING to support the classification of all intensive care patients into the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS). The use of those functions has been pushed when health insurance bodies demanded evidence for the correct classification of ICU beds. This article presents an overview on this development from the start in just one intensive care unit to the complete coverage of six intensive care units and three intensive monitoring units with a total of 109 beds. For those units complete TISS data has been documented for more than a year now at a detailed level. On average 14 interventions have been recorded per patient and day, accumulating to a database with more than a million entries. We describe the experiences made during introduction and the different front-end applications we used to achieve the goal. Results gained from the huge database and their implications for our future work are discussed. TISS documentation is now an established routine on every intensive care unit of our University hospital. It has been implemented without major financial or manpower investments and no specific intensive care information system has been needed. Establishing this type of basic care documentation made nurses aware of their activities, so that now they consider electronic care documentation to be in their very own interest. The next goal has been set by nurses themselves, they want to establish intervention based care documentation on normal wards as well. We think that step by step we will thus be able to achieve a more complete electronic patient record.",

To address this scenario, the present paper conducts a study on the security factors integral to the healthcare information system and conducts the performance analysis of these factors. For this intent, the study has employed the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F.AHP) integrated with Technique Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) integrated framework for evaluating the performance of each factor. Thereafter, the factors that play a vital role in healthcare data security breaches have been prioritized as per their security weights. Furthermore, the validity of the results obtained by the stated methodology has been established by conducting the sensitivity analysis and comparison of results with the other methods by using the same data set. Based on results thus obtained, the access control and software security have been identified as the most promising security factors.",

    "title": "Integrating hospital information systems in healthcare institutions: a mediation architecture.",
    "abstract": "Many studies have examined the integration of information systems into healthcare institutions, leading to several standards in the healthcare domain (CORBAmed: Common Object Request Broker Architecture in Medicine; HL7: Health Level Seven International; DICOM: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine; and IHE: Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise). Due to the existence of a wide diversity of heterogeneous systems, three essential factors are necessary to fully integrate a system: data, functions and workflow. However, most of the previous studies have dealt with only one or two of these factors and this makes the system integration unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a flexible, scalable architecture for Hospital Information Systems (HIS). Our main purpose is to provide a practical solution to insure HIS interoperability so that healthcare institutions can communicate without being obliged to change their local information systems and without altering the tasks of the healthcare professionals. Our architecture is a mediation architecture with 3 levels: 1) a database level, 2) a middleware level and 3) a user interface level. The mediation is based on two central components: the Mediator and the Adapter. Using the XML format allows us to establish a structured, secured exchange of healthcare data. The notion of medical ontology is introduced to solve semantic conflicts and to unify the language used for the exchange. Our mediation architecture provides an effective, promising model that promotes the integration of hospital information systems that are autonomous, heterogeneous, semantically interoperable and platform-independent.",

Under-recording rates were 9.7% for stillbirths, 12% for neonatal deaths, and 5.3% for post-neonatal deaths. In the larger municipalities, the correction of the infant mortality rate was greater than 19%. The superiority of information on infant deaths in the SIH (as compared to the SIM) was 6.5% in municipalities with < 25 thousand inhabitants, 2% in municipalities with 25-80 thousand inhabitants, and 8.3% in those with > 80 thousand inhabitants.

There are many specifications in cardiology, particularly in the ECG standardization arena. The existence of ECG formats, however, does not guarantee the implementation of homogeneous, standardized solutions for ECG management. In fact, hospital management services need to cope with various ECG formats and, moreover, several different visualization applications. This heterogeneity hampers the normalization of integrated, standardized healthcare information systems, hence the need for finding an appropriate combination of ECG formats and a suitable EIS-based software architecture that enables standardized exchange and homogeneous management of ECG formats. Determining such a combination is one objective of this paper. The second aim is to design and develop the integrated healthcare information system that satisfies the requirements posed by the previous determination. The ECG formats selected include ISO/IEEE11073, Standard Communications Protocol for Computer-Assisted Electrocardiography, and an ECG ontology. The EIS-enabling techniques and technologies selected include web services, simple object access protocol, extensible markup language, or business process execution language. Such a selection ensures the standardized exchange of ECGs within, or across, healthcare information systems while providing modularity and accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Several factors influence the responses of users of information retrieval systems who are asked to evaluate the service provided by a system. To realistically estimate user satisfaction, different aspects of the search outcome should be explored. This paper analyzes the data obtained in a follow-up questionnaire sent to a sample of MEDLINE users who had requested searches at seven information centers within a two-month period. The questionnaire requested the user's appraisal of the value of the search and of the usefulness of the retrieved references. A comparison of different items of the questionnaire revealed some contradictions between an overall appraisal of the service and more specific responses on the outcome of the search. Caution is advised in inferring the satisfaction of information needs from the users' evaluation of an information retrieval system.",

The use of video recording for collecting usability data is detailed. The technique employed involves the collection of data consisting of transcripts of physicians as they \"think aloud\" while interacting with the system, along with a video record of the complete user-computer interaction. Using methods of analysis from cognitive science, the study was able to distinguish the source of physician problems in using the system's interface and in interacting with its controlled medical vocabulary. Analysis of the protocols indicated that all subjects encountered several generic problems, the most common ones indicative of a need for greater consistency in the interface design. Based on this evaluation, parts of the user interface have been re-implemented in an ongoing process of iterative system development.",

However, experience shows that most of these benefits will not occur automatically following system implementation. Operational problems may exist that diminish information timeliness, accessibility, and accuracy; policies and procedures may not have been sufficiently tailored to reflect the realities and intents of the systems; and personnel tasks may not have been adequately restructured. In order to realize the full potential of information systems, health care organizations must plan for and implement strategies that are designed to maximize such benefits.

PACS also creates the perfect environment for teleradiology and teleworking setups. One step further is the regional PACS concept where different hospitals or health care enterprises share the images in an integrated Electronic Patient Record. Among the different solutions available to share images between different hospitals IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) organization presents the Cross Enterprise Document Sharing profile (XDS) which allows sharing images from different hospitals even if they have different PACS vendors. Adopting XDS has multiple advantages, images do not need to be duplicated in a central archive to be shared among the different healthcare enterprises, they only need to be indexed and published in a central document registry. In the XDS profile IHE defines the mechanisms to publish and index the images in the central document registry. It also defines the mechanisms that each hospital will use to retrieve those images regardless on the Hospital PACS they are stored.",

    "abstract": "Those who face the difficulties of developing useful patient care information systems (PCISs) often stress the importance of 'organizational issues'. Building upon recent sociological insights in the construction and use of information technologies for (health care) work, this paper underscores the importance of these insights for the development and evaluation of these systems. A sociotechnical approach to PCISs in health care is outlined, and two implications of this empirically grounded approach for the practices of developing and evaluating IT applications in health care practices are discussed. First, getting such technologies to work in concrete health care practices appears to be a politically textured process of organizational change, in which users have to be put at center-stage. This requires an iterative approach, in which the distinctions between 'analysis', 'design', 'implementation' and 'evaluation' blur. Second, a sociotechnical approach sheds new light on the potential roles of IT applications in health care practices. It is critical of approaches that denounce the 'messy' and 'ad hoc' nature of health care work, and that attempt to structure this work through the formal, standardized and 'rational' nature of IT systems. Optimal utilization of IT applications, it is argued, is dependent on the meticulous interrelation of the system's functioning with the skilled and pragmatically oriented work of health care professionals.",

The legally adult population assisted and resident in Lazio Region on 31/12/2019 was equally and casually divided in two samples: the training sample (to define the model) and the validation sample (to measure model performances). On the base of the more complex model of Lazio Region, three population strata were defined: multi-chronic population, multi-chronic population with a high clinical complexity, multi-chronic population with socioeconomic vulnerability. Hospital discharge records were identified in the previous five years prior to 31/12/2019. Through appropriate classification models, it was evaluated the level with which the simplified system \"from SDO\" is able to approximate the more complex algorithm developed by the Lazio Region. Model performances, which has examined only information \"from SDO\", results inadequate. In fact, the Positive Predictive Value (PVV) results equal to 46.3%, 16.3% and 30.3%, respectively for the three analyzed strata. This study demonstrated that using the hospital system as the only Health Information System reduces the possibility to stratify and predict population health needs. For this reason, the improvement of the completeness and of the quality of data from different social and health information systems and their interconnection, represent the essential starting point. In addition, updating record track is needed to simplify the workload of compilers and improve data availability. These actions must also be accompanied by supportive interventions by central bodies for the regions that show the greatest weaknesses, as well as training actions that improve the level of knowledge of compilers.",

    "abstract": "Weak health information systems (HIS) are a critical challenge to reaching the health-related Millennium Development Goals because health systems performance cannot be adequately assessed or monitored where HIS data are incomplete, inaccurate, or untimely. The Population Health Implementation and Training (PHIT) Partnerships were established in five sub-Saharan African countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia) to catalyze advances in strengthening district health systems. Interventions were tailored to the setting in which activities were planned. All five PHIT Partnerships share a common feature in their goal of enhancing HIS and linking data with improved decision-making, specific strategies varied. Mozambique, Ghana, and Tanzania all focus on improving the quality and use of the existing Ministry of Health HIS, while the Zambia and Rwanda partnerships have introduced new information and communication technology systems or tools. All partnerships have adopted a flexible, iterative approach in designing and refining the development of new tools and approaches for HIS enhancement (such as routine data quality audits and automated troubleshooting), as well as improving decision making through timely feedback on health system performance (such as through summary data dashboards or routine data review meetings). The most striking differences between partnership approaches can be found in the level of emphasis of data collection (patient versus health facility), and consequently the level of decision making enhancement (community, facility, district, or provincial leadership). Design differences across PHIT Partnerships reflect differing theories of change, particularly regarding what information is needed, who will use the information to affect change, and how this change is expected to manifest. The iterative process of data use to monitor and assess the health system has been heavily communication dependent, with challenges due to poor feedback loops. Implementation to date has highlighted the importance of engaging frontline staff and managers in improving data collection and its use for informing system improvement. Through rigorous process and impact evaluation, the experience of the PHIT teams hope to contribute to the evidence base in the areas of HIS strengthening, linking HIS with decision making, and its impact on measures of health system outputs and impact.",

    "abstract": "The Missouri evaluation protocol was used for comparing the contents of the Drugdex and de Haen drug information systems. Criteria for evaluating (1) general information content and (2) content of drug-drug interactions are given in the Missouri protocol. To check the two drug information systems for content, 113 sample drugs were randomly selected to represent all pharmacologic-therapeutic categories of the American Hospital Formulary Service. A list of 215 sample drug-drug interactions was randomly selected from Hansten's Drug Interactions. Each system was then search, applying each general content criterion and drug interaction criterion to each sample drug and sample interaction, respectively. Raw data were transformed into the Missouri protocol's seven weighted variables, and aggregate scores were obtained by summing the weighted scores for the variables. All scoring measurements were done by one investigator. Both raw (unweighted) and weighted scores were analyzed. Aggregate scores showed no significant differences between Drugdex and de Haen for either general information content or content of drug-drug interactions. However, analysis of raw data contradicted these results by showing differences between systems for several variables. The de Haen system included general information on a greater percentage of the sample drugs, but Drugdex covered more information criteria per drug. Drugdex contained a greater percentage of the sample drug-drug interactions, but de Haen covered more criteria for a listed interaction. The results of this study suggest that neither Drugdex nor the de Haen system can be recommended for use in lieu of the other. The Missouri protocol has flaws that preclude its routine use for comparative evaluation of drug information systems.",

    "abstract": "Management of child health care can be negatively affected by incomplete recording, low data quality, and lack of data integration of health management information systems to support decision making and public health program needs. Given the importance of identifying key determinants of child health via capturing and integrating accurate and high-quality information, we aim to address this gap through the development and testing requirements for an integrated child health information system. A five-phase design thinking approach including empathizing, defining, ideation, prototyping, and testing was applied. We employed observations and interviews with the health workers at the primary health care network to identify end-users' challenges and needs using tools in human-centered design and focus group discussion. Then, a potential solution to the identified problems was developed as an integrated maternal and child health information system (IMCHIS) prototype and tested using Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation Model (SQuaRE) ISO/IEC 25000. IMCHIS was developed as a web-based system with 74 data elements and seven maternal and child health care requirements. The requirements of \"child disease\" with weight (0.26), \"child nutrition\" with weight (0.20), and \"prenatal care\" with weight (0.16) acquired the maximum weight coefficient. In the testing phase, the highest score with the weight coefficient of 0.48 and 0.73 was attributed to efficiency and functionality characteristics, focusing on software capability to fulfill the tasks that meet users' needs. Implementing a successful child health care system integrates both maternal and child health care information systems to track the effect of maternal conditions on child health and support managing performance and optimizing service delivery. The highest quality score of IMCHIS in efficiency and functionality characteristics confirms that it owns the capability to identify key determinants of child health.",

    "abstract": "The telecare medicine information system enables or supports health-care delivery services. In recent years, the increased availability of lower-cost telecommunications systems and custom made physiological monitoring devices for patients have made it possible to bring the advantages of telemedicine directly into the patient's home. These systems are moving towards an environment where automated patient medical records and electronically interconnected telecare facilities are prevalent. A secure authentication scheme will thus be needed to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Many schemes based on cryptography have been proposed for the goals. However, much of the schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, and are neither efficient, nor user friendly. Specially, in terms of efficiency, some schemes need the exponential computation resulting in high time cost. Therefore, we propose a novel authentication scheme that is added the pre-computing idea within the communication process to avoid the time-consuming exponential computations. Finally, it is shown to be more secure and practical for telecare medicine environments.",

Data from 2000-2002 for all municipalities were analyzed according to population size and geographic region. Five indicators were considered: age-standardized mortality rate; ratio of reported-to-estimated live births; relative mean deviation of the mortality rate; relative mean deviation of the birth rate; and proportion of deaths with undetermined causes. Adequacy criteria were established statistically for eight Brazilian States in which vital statistics were adequate. The results showed important socio-spatial inequalities: in general, the proportion of adequate vital statistics was higher in the Central-South of the country and in larger municipalities. The live birth data system received the best evaluation for three items. The mortality data system requires both a reduction in underreporting and improved data on cause of death in order to orient health programs focused on decreasing inequalities in infant mortality in Brazil.",

    "title": "Routine health information system utilization for evidence-based decision making in Amhara national regional state, northwest Ethiopia: a multi-level analysis.",
    "abstract": "Health Information System is the key to making evidence-based decisions. Ethiopia has been implementing the Health Management Information System (HMIS) since 2008 to collect routine health data and revised it in 2017. However, the evidence is meager on the use of routine health information for decision making among department heads in the health facilities. The study aimed to assess the proportion of routine health information systems utilization for evidence-based decisions and factors associated with it. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 386 department heads from 83 health facilities in ten selected districts in the Amhara region Northwest of Ethiopia from April to May 2019. The single population proportion formula was applied to estimate the sample size taking into account the proportion of data use 0.69, margin of error 0.05, and the critical value 1.96 at the 95% CI. The final sample size was estimated at 394 by considering 1.5 as a design effect and 5% non-response. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Descriptive statistics mean and percentage were calculated. The study employed a generalized linear mixed-effect model. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) and the 95% CI were calculated. Variables with p value < 0.05 were considered as predictors of routine health information system use. Proportion of information use among department heads for decision making was estimated at 46%. Displaying demographic (AOR = 12.42, 95% CI [5.52, 27.98]) and performance (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.33, 2.11]) data for monitoring, and providing feedback to HMIS unit (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI [1.05, 5.00]) were individual (level-1) predictors. Maintaining performance monitoring team minute (AOR = 3.53; 95% CI [1.61, 7.75]), receiving senior management directives (AOR = 3.56; 95% CI [1.76, 7.19]), supervision (AOR = 2.84; 95% CI [1.33, 6.07]), using HMIS data for target setting (AOR = 3.43; 95% CI [1.66, 7.09]), and work location (AOR = 0.16; 95% CI [0.07, 0.39]) were organizational (level-2) explanatory variables. The proportion of routine health information utilization for decision making was low. Displaying demographic and performance data, providing feedback to HMIS unit, maintaining performance monitoring team minute, conducting supervision, using HMIS data for target setting, and work location were factors associated with the use of routine health information for decision making. Therefore, strengthening the capacity of department heads on data displaying, supervision, feedback mechanisms, and engagement of senior management are highly recommended.",

The salient features of each of the integrated tools with GIS are discussed in this paper. It is also addressed how GIS can help in optimizing routes for collection of solid wastes from transfer stations to disposal sites to reduce the overall cost of solid waste management. A detailed approach on performing a public acceptance study of a proposed landfill site is presented in this study.

The first was to map the illegal construction and demolition of waste disposal points across Recife and classify the waste according to its recyclability. In sequence, a method for indicating suitable areas for installation of voluntary delivery points, for small waste generators, are presented. Finally, a method for indicating suitable areas for the installation of trans-shipment and waste sorting areas, developed for large generators, is presented. The results show that a geographic information system is an essential tool in the planning of municipal construction and demolition waste management, in order to facilitate the spatial analysis and control the generation, sorting, collection, transportation, and final destination of construction and demolition waste, increasing the rate of recovery and recycling of materials.",

    "title": "Confidentiality issues within a clinical information system: moving from data-driven to event-driven design.",
    "abstract": "Within a hospital, the moving of medical information systems from retrospective data-gathering methods to prospective clinical information systems raises the question of the confidentiality of patient data. A method of improving the traditional matrix model usually used to achieve access controls is described. The event-driven model refers to the way a security system ensures that a given user has a valid \"need-to\" relationship to a given patient. Events are defined as the occurrence of specific data that trigger the creation or the updating of the relationship between the identity of a user and the identity of a patient (e.g., admission, discharge, transfer, prescription, and report). The creation and the deletion of the relationships between users and patients are based on numerous repositories and working lists of patients. This implementation requires an organization of the hospital activities which is able to manage, in a real-time manner, those repositories as closely as possible to the steps occurring during the patient's care process. Although this approach seems to reasonably fit the dynamic of the care process, it adds significant organizational constraints.",

We have developed an approach that attempts to represent such phenotypic data in its most atomic form to facilitate aggregation. We illustrate this approach with human blood antigen typing (ABO-Rh) data drawn from the National Institutes of Health's Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS). In applying the method to actual patient data, we discovered a 2% incidence of changed blood types. We believe our approach can be applied to any institution's data to obtain comparable patient phenotypes. The actual discrepant blood type data will form the basis for a future study of the reasons for blood typing variation.",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing need for designing and monitoring health information sites through comprehensive examination of the various elements of website quality, there is little research that systematically models and presents such examinations. Applying the updated DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success, this research aimed to examine how health information sites' information quality, system quality, and service quality lead to user satisfaction and perceived benefits. This research was conducted in a specific context of the National Health Information Portal (NHIP), a governmental health information site in South Korea. We conducted online survey in 2017, with 506 adults from the NHIP consumer panel. Data were analyzed using a confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical ordinary least squares regression, and bootstrapping approach for a mediation test. Of the three quality factors, information quality had significant associations with all outcome variables: user satisfaction, intention to reuse the site, and perceived benefits of site use in health settings. There were also indirect paths from information quality to perceived benefits, one mediated through intention and the other mediated through satisfaction and then intention. Service quality had a significant association with user satisfaction, and its impact on perceived benefits occurred indirectly through user satisfaction and intention in serial. By contrast, the role of system quality received no empirical support. The results offer theoretical and practical implications for how to enhance the effectiveness of online health information sites.",

    "abstract": "Information management and the usability of health information systems (HIS) are important for the development of HIS in occupational health services. User participation in the HIS development process has been shown to contribute to the success of an HIS. The purpose of this study was to analyze how user participation in HIS development affected evaluation of the success of HIS. The success was assessed on the basis of the DeLone and McLean Information Systems (IS) Success Model. The study was conducted within occupational health services and the data (n=210) was analyzed with quantitative methods. The results showed that users participating in the HIS development process assessed the success of the HIS as better than those that had not taken part in the development. This difference could be seen in all seven dimensions of the DeLone and McLean IS success model but was statistically significant only for System Quality and Intention to Use. The results also showed that the users that had participated in the HIS development process also used the HIS more often and more extensively than those that had not participated in the development. The results indicate that user participation in the development process positively influences their assessment of the HIS and increases their active use of the IS. However, more research is needed to determine the long-term effects of using participatory design in HIS development.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Data Repositories are being rapidly adopted by large healthcare organizations as a method of centralizing and unifying clinical data currently stored in diverse and isolated information systems. Once stored in a clinical data repository, healthcare organizations seek to use this centralized data to store, analyze, interpret, and influence clinical care, quality and outcomes. A recent trend in the repository field has been the adoption of data marts--specialized subsets of enterprise-wide data taken from a larger repository designed specifically to answer highly focused questions. A data mart exploits the data stored in the repository, but can use unique structures or summary statistics generated specifically for an area of study. Thus, data marts benefit from the existence of a repository, are less general than a repository, but provide more effective and efficient support for an enterprise-wide data analysis task. In previous work, we described the use of batch processing for populating data marts directly from legacy systems. In this paper, we describe an architecture that uses both primary data sources and an evolving enterprise-wide clinical data repository to create real-time data sources for a clinical data mart to support highly specialized clinical expert systems.",

While there are many published examples of successful implementations of CPOE with decision support, there remain questions about the effectiveness of commercially available information system products, particularly in the emergency department (ED). We describe an attempt at using the available CPOE functionality in a commercial ED information system to deliver guideline knowledge and report the results of physician surveys regarding paper-based guideline/order-sets and the corresponding CPOE order-sets that replaced them. Physicians reported that they liked the CPOE order-sets better than the paper version and did use the order-sets, but guide-line compliance did not improve. Cultural and organizational issues as well as limitations in the functionality of the commercial system appear to have limited the effectiveness of this implementation.",

    "abstract": "To achieve national and international strategic goals, countries are advised to assess the maturity status of their health information systems (HIS), including business continuity and interoperability. This work aims to determine the existing maturity status of the Ethiopian HIS, set HIS improvement goals, and inform a path towards an improved national HIS by the end of 2024. This assessment was a collaborative and transparent process that was carried out with the engagement of all key stakeholders through consultation. We used the Stages of Continuous Improvement (SOCI) tool to guide the assessment to measure the maturity level of the Ethiopian HIS in five core domains, 13 components and 39 subcomponents and to guide future plans. The overall average score of the national HIS maturity was 2.68/5, which is categorized between repeatable (stage 2) and defined (stage 3) maturity levels. The assessment findings revealed that three out of the five HIS maturity domains were at a repeatable stage. Only the leadership and governance and the data quality and use domains were at the defined maturity level. A majority (7/13) of the subcomponents were at the repeatable level of maturity, while four were at the defined level. Policy, legal and regulatory framework and compliance from the leadership and governance domain and interoperability from the data quality and use domain were categorized as having an emerging status. Considering the current HIS maturity status, gaps and strengths identified, ongoing HIS initiatives, existing platforms, and the interest and level of engagement of senior government leadership, this assessment put forward an improvement roadmap for achieving the desired managed stage (4.37) of maturity by the end of 2024. The findings show that the overall maturity level of the Ethiopian HIS is 2.68, which is between the repeatable and defined maturity stages. Enforcement of policies and legislation, data exchange among systems, and information and communication technology infrastructure business continuity planning are the main challenges of Ethiopian HIS requiring further investment. Strengthened and collaborative effort is critical to reaching the desired goal of \"managed\" HIS (stage 4) in the country by 2024.",

Standards for systems integration have improved a lot, but their usefulness is limited where system evolution is needed. Sustainable Healthcare Information Systems should be based on system architectures that support system evolution and avoid costly system replacements every five to ten years. Some basic principles for the design of such systems are separation of concerns, loose coupling, deferred systems design, and service oriented architectures.",

    "abstract": "Although information systems (IS) have been extensively applied in the health sector worldwide, few initiatives have addressed the health and safety of health workers, a group acknowledged to be at high risk of injury and illness, as well as in great shortage globally, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Adapting a context-mechanism-outcome case study design, we analyze our team's own experience over two decades to address this gap: in two different Canadian provinces; and two distinct South African settings. Applying a realist analysis within an adapted structuration theory framing sensitive to power relations, we explore contextual (socio-political and technological) characteristics and mechanisms affecting outcomes at micro, meso and macro levels. Technological limitations hindered IS usefulness in the initial Canadian locale, while staffing inadequacies amid pronounced power imbalances affecting governance restricted IS usefulness in the subsequent Canadian application. Implementation in South Africa highlighted the special care needed to address power dynamics regarding both worker-employer relations (relevant to all occupational health settings) and North-south imbalances (common to all international interactions). Researchers, managers and front-line workers all view IS implementation differently; relationships amongst the workplace parties and between community and academic partners have been pivotal in determining outcome in all circumstances. Capacity building and applying creative commons and open source solutions are showing promise, as is international collaboration. There is worldwide consensus on the need for IS use to protect the health workforce. However, IS implementation is a resource-intensive undertaking; regardless of how carefully designed the software, contextual factors and the mechanisms adopted to address these are critical to mitigate threats and achieve outcomes of interest to all parties. Issues specific to IS development, including technological support and software licensing models, can also affect outcome and sustainability - especially in the North-south context. Careful attention must be given to power relations between the various stakeholders at macro, meso and micro levels when implementing IS. North-South-South collaborations should be encouraged. Governance as well as technological issues are crucial determinants of IS application, and ultimately whether the system is seen as a tool, weapon, or white elephant by the various involved parties.\"You may call me a fool, But was there a rule The weapon should be turned into a tool? And what do we see? The first tool I step on Turned into a weapon. - Robert Frost\"\"White (albino) elephants were regarded as holy in ancient times in Thailand and other Asian countries. Keeping a white elephant was a very expensive undertaking, since the owner had to provide the elephant with special food and provide access for people who wanted to worship it. If a Thai King became dissatisfied with a subordinate, he would give him a white elephant. The gift would, in most cases, ruin the recipient. - The Phrase Finder\"",

A representation of the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) Semantic Network and Metathesaurus was created using the RDF standard, in order to represent the basic medical ontology. The inference over the knowledge base is done by the TRI-DEDALO System, a deductive data-base created to query and update RDF based knowledge sources as well as conventional relational databases. Finally, an ontology was created for the Brazilian National Health Card data interchange format, a standard to capture and transmit health encounter information throughout the country.

    "abstract": "At the University Hospital Giessen, an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) is used for online record keeping of perioperative patient care, but preoperative anaesthesia assessments were still being recorded on paper and subsequently entered into the AIMS. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) seem to be useful instruments to establish a seamless digital anesthesiological documentation. We decided to implement a solution for direct integration of data gathered during the preoperative assessment into the existing data management infrastructure. Parallel to the development of the system, we surveyed the future users to match their wishes and needs as far as possible. A C program embedding the preoperative AIMS' data fields was developed. Data alignment with the Hospital information system (HIS) is controlled by a Java desktop software. The anaesthesiologist completes the available fields at the patient's bedside following the same algorithm and integrity check as the PC version. STATUS REPORT: Overall, 68% of the surveyed physicians supported the implementation of the system. The PDA solution has been available since May 2002. Data replication into the handheld and integration of mobile collected data into the AIMS generally work without problems. The HIS interconnection software converts the PDA file into the AIMS format for further processing. The preoperative anaesthetic assessment is a standardised task well suitable for conversion to an electronic data storage medium. Changing from redundant data entry in the OR to direct electronic recording at the patient's bedside seems simply logical. Handheld computers are inexpensive, flexible gadgets to realize this.",

    "abstract": "The quality of information on race/color is a necessary condition for knowing the impact of inequality on mortality. This study aims to analyze the trend and inequality in completeness of race/color in death records of elderly in Brazil's Mortality Information System (SIM in Portuguese) from 2000 to 2015. The study analyzes the completeness of this variable according to different geographic areas, the race or color most affected by poor completeness of records, and the association between excellent completion of race/color and the municipalities' territoriality and socioeconomic status. Data on deaths of elderly individuals were obtained from the SIM and information on the population from censuses and Ministry of Health estimates. The study estimates the percent variation in the proportion of incompleteness. The percent variation of black and brown individuals was estimated from 2000 to 2010 from the SIM and censuses. Crude and adjusted logistic regression (95%CI) were used to estimate completeness of race/color as the outcome and territorial and socioeconomic characteristics as independent variables. We found a sharp improvement in quality of completion during the period, especially up to 2006, with an excellent average since 2007. The findings showed territorial inequality at the municipal level. Municipalities with low/medium HDI (with a high proportion of poverty and inequality) showed lower odds of excellent completeness. The adjusted model shows that the region and size of the municipality are characteristics that explain the excellent quality of the race/color variable. Municipalities in Northeast Brazil and small municipalities have the lowest odds of excellent completeness. In conclusion, race/color in the SIM has sufficient quality to be used in studies on inequality of mortality in the elderly, with exceptions at the municipal level.",

    "abstract": "To quantify the burden of communicable diseases and characterize the most reported infections during public health emergency of floods in Pakistan. The study's design is a descriptive trend analysis. The study utilized the disease data reported to District Health Information System (DHIS2) for the 12 most frequently reported priority diseases under the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system in Pakistan. In total, there were 1,532,963 suspected cases during August to December 2022 in flood-affected districts (n = 75) across Pakistan; Sindh Province reported the highest number of cases (n = 692,673) from 23 districts, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) (n = 568,682) from 17 districts, Balochistan (n = 167,215) from 32 districts, and Punjab (n = 104,393) from 3 districts. High positivity was reported for malaria (79,622/201,901; 39.4%), followed by acute diarrhea (non-cholera) (23/62; 37.1%), hepatitis A and E (47/252; 18.7%), and dengue (603/3245; 18.6%). The crude mortality rate was 11.9 per 10 000 population (1824/1,532,963 [deaths/cases]). The study identified acute respiratory infection, acute diarrhea, malaria, and skin diseases as the most prevalent diseases. This suggests that preparedness efforts and interventions targeting these diseases should be prioritized in future flood response plans. The study highlights the importance of strengthening the IDSR as a Disease Early Warning System through the implementation of the DHIS2.",

This paper seeks to design a report template to be used for decision-making in both public and university hospitals. The theoretical approach sought inspiration in discussions about the SUS, hospital institutions, hospital information systems and decision-making. The methodological procedures used are characterized as qualitative-descriptive methods and were conducted in a single case study and action research. The primary data analysis was carried out in two stages from January through December 2007 and from January through December 2008. Based on these periods, the findings were described and the elaboration of new reports was presented, with the importance and need for each being duly emphasized. Lastly, a structured report template was created for the case study that includes information discussed in the article. The conclusion reached is that the hospital information system can become a potential support tool, as the necessary adjustments are made and the report is structured to furnish the institution with an objective communication tool for decision-making.",

Thus in this study, multi-criteria decision analysis incorporated into a geographic information system was used to determine potential waste transfer station sites. The key result established 11 sites located within six different sub-metros. This result can be used by decision makers for site selection of the waste transfer stations after taking into account other relevant ecological and economic factors.",

In order to achieve important goals, such as the improvement of growth or yield, it is indispensable to understand biological processes on a detailed level. Therefore, the well-structured management of fine-grained information about metabolic pathways is of high interest. Thus, we developed the MetaCrop information system, a manually curated repository of high quality information concerning the metabolism of crop plants. However, the data access to and flexible export of information of MetaCrop in standard exchange formats had to be improved. To automate and accelerate the data access we designed a set of web services to be integrated into external software. These web services have already been used by an add-on for the visualisation toolkit VANTED. Furthermore, we developed an export feature for the MetaCrop web interface, thus enabling the user to compose individual metabolic models using SBML.",

The CODROPA system is potentially useful in detecting trends of diseases. However, the long delay between data collection and data analysis does not allow for early detection of epidemics and clusters of diseases may be missed.

    "abstract": "The objective of our study was to support algorithmic recommendations for the appropriate sizing of picture archiving and communication system (PACS) caches. For a large PACS installation, a detailed analysis of current radiographic (CR), CT and MRI studies (n=400 consecutive studies, respectively) was performed. In this process every available prior examination was also considered. A new algorithmic procedure for appropriate sizing of PACS caches was developed and applied to the given cache implementation. The number of all priors was 7.6+/-12.3. Of them, 61% were relevant priors with an average age of 203+/-385 days. A basic cache (BC) that covers 12 months of current imaging results in a pre-fetching quote of 15.4% (8.6% for 24 months). In the PACS installation examined, a minimal threefold increase in cache capacity was recommended. Studies that are retrieved, prior to viewing, from the long-term archive require additional space in the extended cache (EC). An intimate and mutual interaction between hospital information system (HIS), radiology information system (RIS) and PACS minimizes this requirement and increases the time during which actual image material from the BC is available online. A basic cache size covering actual imaging of 12 months up to 24 months is recommended. The parameters governing the individual dimensions of both cache spaces and a mathematical algorithm are demonstrated.",

Recent reports of information system failure, particularly computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, shows the result of such IT failure in actual practice. Such mismatches with healthcare work requirements require improvement to IT research and development. Resilience is the feature of some systems that makes it possible for them to respond to sudden, unanticipated demands for performance and return to normal operation quickly, with minimum decrement in performance. Workers create resilience at healthcare's sharp end by daily confronting constraints and obstacles that need to be surmounted in order to accomplish results. The resident sign-out sheet is described as an example of resilience. Efforts to develop successful IT systems for healthcare's sharp end must incorporate properties that reflect work domain traits, as the sign-out sheet shows.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric guidelines based care is often overlooked because of the constraints of a typical office visit and the sheer number of guidelines that may exist for a patient's visit. In response to this problem, in 2004 we developed a pediatric computer based clinical decision support system using Arden Syntax medical logic modules (MLM). The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation system (CHICA) screens patient families in the waiting room and alerts the physician in the exam room. Here we describe adaptation of Arden Syntax to support production and consumption of patient specific tailored documents for every clinical encounter in CHICA and describe the experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. As of this writing CHICA has served over 44,000 patients at 7 pediatric clinics in our healthcare system in the last decade and its MLMs have been fired 6182,700 times in \"produce\" and 5334,021 times in \"consume\" mode. It has run continuously for over 10 years and has been used by 755 physicians, residents, fellows, nurse practitioners, nurses and clinical staff. There are 429 MLMs implemented in CHICA, using the Arden Syntax standard. Studies of CHICA's effectiveness include several published randomized controlled trials. Our results show that the Arden Syntax standard provided us with an effective way to represent pediatric guidelines for use in routine care. We only required minor modifications to the standard to support our clinical workflow. Additionally, Arden Syntax implementation in CHICA facilitated the study of many pediatric guidelines in real clinical environments.",

The objective is to compare the information systems of Brazil and South Africa regarding the configuration and implementation of the item race/skin color. This is a qualitative, descriptive study, based on the content analysis proposed by Bardin. A survey on race/skin color was carried out in health department documents and ministerial sites in both countries. The collected material was processed and analyzed utilizing the IRAMUTEQ R software, version 0.7 alpha 2, with a test × 2 > 3.80 (p < 0.05), and by the TABNET application version 4.14 and Excel software, version 2016. In Brazil and Africa South, several health information systems did not include race/skin color. In both countries, health information systems were boosted in the mid-1990s. In Brazil, of the systems that provide data by race/skin color, the inclusion occurred after claims by the black movement. In South Africa, through the creation of the respective systems. The historical configuration of the question of race/skin color in both countries was guided by political and ideological references. In multiracial and unequal countries, race/skin color is a central political category to promote health equity.",

    "abstract": "With the development of the internet, applications have become complicated, and the relevant technology has diversified. Compared with medical applications, the significance of information technology has been expanding to include clinical auxiliary functions of medical information. This includes electronic medical records, electronic prescriptions, medical information systems, etc. Although research on the data processing structure and format of various related systems is becoming mature, the integration is insufficient. An integrated medical information system with security policy and privacy protection, which combines e-patient records, e-prescriptions, modified smart cards, and fingerprint identification systems, and applies proxy signature and group signature, is proposed in this study. This system effectively applies and saves medical resources-satisfying the mobility of medical records, presenting the function, and security of medicine collection, and avoiding medical conflicts and profiteering to further acquire the maximum effectiveness with the least resources. In this way, this medical information system may be developed into a comprehensive function that eliminates the transmission of manual documents and maintains the safety of patient medical information. It can improve the quality of medical care and indispensable infrastructure for medical management.",

    "abstract": "On-line connection of automated analyzers to laboratory information system (LIS) reduces mistakes in inputing data for each samples. It also makes reporting faster in clinical laboratory. Moreover, connection of these instruments with sample transporting system enables analyses without touching samples directly. It, however, costs extremely high to construct such a system. It is because every automated analyzer uses different connecting protocol, so that we have to make a different program for each machine. For solving this problem, we have to make a standard for connecting protocol. It is very difficult to make a standard protocol fitting on all of the analyzers, considering its cost and other things. Furthermore, it must take a few decades to spreading the standard through the end users. ICCLS and NCCLS has been taking a central role for this problem since 1996, with a five-year plan to make an international standard. Until the standard will be laid, each clinical laboratories have to pay high costs to construct their systems, connecting different manufacturers' analyzers each other. Thus, we have developed a novel system which enables us to construct a laboratory automation system in a shorter time. For realizing this new system, we have reduced the number of connecting protocols for analyzers. Moreover, we have corrected the flow of laboratory works in order. Each programs are put together into a system as parts, or modules. This software system is now in operation in the clinical laboratory of Kochi Medical School. In this report, we describe the construction of this novel software system, and the effect obtained by using this system. Furthermore, we would show problems and things to be improved for making international standards for communication protocols between host and analyzing instruments.",

One of the key goals of their reorganisation is integration based on open standards in order to achieve optimal interoperability. At the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Clinical Centre Maribor, we have set up an intranet integrating a variety of diagnostic procedures into a single network. All workstations are connected to a dedicated data server, which represents the core of the network. The system is compatible with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard and ready for future integration with hospital information systems over the HL 7 (Health Level 7) protocol. With the integration of different systems we have achieved the availability of all administrative, clinical and photo documentation for each patient on every workstation. This kind of system enables numerous connections within different diagnostic units and workstations, which is most distinctive during the diagnostic work-up of complex clinical cases. At our department integration of different diagnostic units into one ophthalmology information system proved to be a helpful tool regarding patient care during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and at the same time represents a reduction of burdens for the medical staff.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to describe an m-health initiative to strengthen malaria surveillance in a 184-health facility, multi-province, project aimed at strengthening the National Health Information System (NHIS) in a country with fragmented malaria surveillance, striving towards enhanced control, pre-elimination. A remote-loading mobile application and secure online platform for health professionals was created to interface with the new system (eNHIS). A case-based malaria testing register was developed and integrated geo-coded households, villages and health facilities. A malaria programme management dashboard was created, with village-level malaria mapping tools, and statistical algorithms to identify malaria outbreaks. Since its inception in 2015, 160,750 malaria testing records, including village of residence, have been reported to the eNHIS. These case-based, geo-coded malaria data are 100% complete, with a median data entry delay of 9 days from the date of testing. The system maps malaria to the village level in near real-time as well as the availability of treatment and diagnostics to health facility level. Data aggregation, analysis, outbreak detection, and reporting are automated. The study demonstrates that using mobile technologies and GIS in the capture and reporting of NHIS data in Papua New Guinea provides timely, high quality, geo-coded, case-based malaria data required for malaria elimination. The health systems strengthening approach of integrating malaria information management into the eNHIS optimizes sustainability and provides enormous flexibility to cater for future malaria programme needs.",

The authors use the Web to facilitate interaction between their Web-based Clinical Information System and a decision-support system-DXplain, at the Massachusetts General Hospital-using local architecture and Common Gateway Interface programs. The current application translates patients laboratory test results into DXplain's terms to generate diagnostic hypotheses. Two different access methods are utilized for this model; Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and TCP/IP function calls. While clinical aspects cannot be evaluated as yet, the model demonstrates the potential of Web-based applications for interaction and integration and how local architecture, with a controlled vocabulary server, can further facilitate such integration. This model serves to demonstrate some of the limitations of the current WWW technology and identifies issues such as control over Web resources and their utilization and liability issues as possible obstacles for further integration.",

HL7 standards are varied, however this work focusses on v2 and v3 since these are the most used one on the area that this work is being conducted. This works aims to allow modeling HL7 standard by using UML. Several techniques based on the MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) paradigm have been used to cope with it.

We are developing a clinical data warehouse where more than 20 years of clinical data can be persisted, and newly generated data from different sources can be integrated. A back room was created to store all hospital information system data in a PostgreSQL database. Due to the enormous number of diverse forms in the hospital information system, a broker service was developed that integrates the individual data sources into the data warehouse as soon as they are released for storage. The front room represents the interface from the infrastructure to the targeted analysis. Database query and visualization tools or business intelligence tools can display and analyze processed and interleaved data. In all areas of business and medicine, structured and quality-adjusted data is of major importance. With the help of a clinical data warehouse system, it is possible to perform patient-centered analyses and thus realize optimal therapy.

    "abstract": "Due to typical problems (heterogeneity, lack of clinical functionality, Y2K problems) the board of directors of the university hospital of Marburg decided in 1997 to replace major components of the existing system by commercially available software. The products available on the market were analyzed, and, under participation of different user groups, a comprehensive functional specification was generated. This was the basis for a Europe-wide vendor selection process. In this context, several key aspects were identified, which are critically important for realizing a HIS that fulfills the specified functional requirements. Among these key aspects are the integration of heterogeneous system components, the support of cross-departmental workflow, and flexibility as well as adaptability to specific clinical requirements. As a result, we found that with today's commercially available products and standards there is no single solution that fully meets all requirements. However, some \"generalist\" vendors are offering integrated systems with acceptable clinical functionality. Tools are emerging which enable the clinical user to generate forms for data input and data flow. Still, a hospital information system will consist of separate components that have to be integrated, but the role of integrated, component-based approaches is becoming more important.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing need to apply established standards for recording data on mosquito collection events, because of the diversity of potential data providers, and the growth and interoperability of online databases designed to host these collection records. In particular, adequate taxonomic and georeference data are needed for geodatabases such as Mosquitomap (http://www. mosquitomap.org/) that map and compare these collection points with other spatial information in a geographical information system (GIS) setting. Accurately georeferenced collection data are crucial for understanding mosquito biogeography, ecology, and the impact of environmental changes, as well as for species distribution modeling, planning mosquito surveys, and for determining disease risk. We sampled representative published reports of new mosquito species records from 1980 in North America to the present to ascertain the quality of georeference information. Our results show that authors have increased the frequency of reporting georeferences but that they vary in the precision of the georeference, and some information, such as the source, date, and datum of the georeference, are usually not given. We discuss recently established standards for recording collection events, some relevant online resources available to researchers to assist them in their georeferencing, and the data input schema developed for the Mosquitomap database. We propose that the mosquito research community adopt data standards for recording and reporting the results of mosquito collection events to increase the value of these data. In particular, we recommend authors lodge voucher specimens and use a GPS set to the WGS84 datum.",

    "title": "Research gaps in routine health information system design barriers to data quality and use in low- and middle-income countries: A literature review.",
    "abstract": "Despite the potential impact of health information system (HIS) design barriers on health data quality and use and, ultimately, health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), no comprehensive literature review has been conducted to study them in this context. We therefore conducted a formal literature review to understand system design barriers to data quality and use in LMICs and to identify any major research gaps related understanding how system design affects data use. We conducted an electronic search across 4 scientific databases-PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Global Health-and consulted a data use expert. Following a systematic inclusion and exclusion process, 316 publications (316 abstracts and 18 full papers) were included in the review. We found a paucity of scientific publications that explicitly describe system design factors that hamper data quality or data use for decision making. Although user involvement, work flow, human-computer interactions, and user experience are critical aspects of system design, our findings suggest that these issues are not discussed or conceptualized in the literature. Findings also showed that individual training efforts focus primarily on imparting data analysis skills. The adverse impact of HIS design barriers on data integrity and health system performance may be even bigger in LMICs than elsewhere, leading to errors in population health management and clinical care. We argue for integrating systems thinking into HIS strengthening efforts to reduce the HIS design-user reality gap.",

    "title": "Current status and perceived needs of information technology in Critical Access Hospitals: a survey study.",
    "abstract": "The US Congress established the designation of Critical Access Hospitals in 1997, recognising rural hospitals as vital links to health for rural and underserved populations. The intent of the reimbursement system is to improve financial performance, thereby reducing hospital closures. Informatics applications are thought to be tools that can enable the sustainability of such facilities. The aim of this study is to identify the current use of information and communication technology in Critical Access Hospitals, and to assess their readiness and receptiveness for the use of new software and hardware applications and their perceived information technology (IT) needs. A survey was mailed to the administrators of all Critical Access Hospitals in one US state (Missouri) and a reminder was mailed a few weeks later. Twenty-seven out of 33 surveys were filled out and returned (response rate 82%). While most respondents (66.7%) stated that their employees have been somewhat comfortable in using new technology, almost 15% stated that their employees have been somewhat uncomfortable. Similarly, almost 12% of the respondents stated that they themselves felt somewhat uncomfortable introducing new technology. While all facilities have computers, only half of them have a specific IT plan. Findings indicate that Critical Access Hospitals are often struggling with lack of resources and specific applications that address their needs. However, it is widely recognised that IT plays an essential role in the sustainability of their organisations. The study demonstrates that IT applications have to be customised to address the needs and infrastructure of the rural settings in order to be accepted and properly utilised.",

Using comprehensive and detailed terminology to represent clinical rules in computer systems, associated with patient information, would allow clinical software to provide patient specific recommendations or alerts. In order to uniform data collection through our HIS, and lay the foundations for future clinical decision support systems, we decided to move from our previous classification-based medical record into new terminology services built around Snomed CT, Spanish Language Version. This paper describes the characteristics of our Terminology Server. The most important achievements of our new terminology system are the centralization of knowledge representation, using a much more detailed terminology system. Clinical data entered at any place of the institution and level of care, is represented uniformly through the whole health information system.",

Consecutive blocked-subject case studies were conducted, based on action research methods. Starting with a QFD model for software development, a model for information system design, the Medical Software Quality Deployment (MSQD) model, was developed. The MSQD model was divided into the pre-study phase, in which the customer categories and their power to influence the design are determined; the data collection phase, in which the voice of customers (VoC) is identified by observations and interviews and quantified by Critical. Incident questionnaires; the need specification phase, where the VoC is specified into ranked customer needs; and the design phase where the customer needs are transformed stepwise to technical requirements and design attributes. QFD showed to be useful for integrating the values of different customer categories in software development for health-care settings. In the later design phases, other quality methods should be used for software implementation and testing.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the number of cases, deaths, incidence and fatality rate due to visceral leishmaniasis, and to estimate its underreporting, as well as the coverage of the national information systems. Confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis were analyzed, based on the following systems: the Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (SINAN - Information System on Disease Notification), the Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade (SIM - Mortality Information System) and the Sistema de Informações Hospitalares (SIH - Hospital Information System), between 2002 and 2003. The variables utilized in relationship for pair identification were: patient's name, mother's name, date of birth, gender, city of residence, and mailing address. The capture-recapture method was applied to calculate the estimates, by means of the Chapman formula. The estimated underreporting of visceral leishmaniasis in the SINAN, in relation to the SIH and the SIM, was 42.2% and 45.0% respectively. The estimated underreporting of deaths was 53% and 46.5%, when compared to SINAN-deaths and SIH-deaths respectively. The estimated incidence was 2.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, from the comparison between the SINAN and the SIH, 70.5% higher than the one found when SINAN's data were the only ones utilized. Furthermore, when comparing data from SIM and SINAN-deaths, an estimated fatality rate of 8% was observed, representing an increase in 16% from the one initially registered in the SINAN-deaths. The results show high estimated underreporting of cases and deaths due to visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. The relationship between information systems and the capture-recapture method application enabled to know and improve the epidemiological estimates, making its utilization in health services feasible.",

One of the actions defined in this framework is related to improving the measurement, monitoring, and understanding of characteristics, factors, and needs related to aging and health. The aim was to analyze and assess the process of construction and development of the Strategic Information System on Health, Funcional Dependence and Aging (SIESDE, for its acronym in Spanish). SIESDE will provide strategic information in Mexico at the municipal, state, and national levels that support the public policies on healthy aging. The system processes and analyzes the data sources of the Health Information Systems and the National System of Statistical and Geographical Information. SIESDE comprises three components: (1) Design, construction, and evaluation of the indicators; (2) storage, management, and visualization, and (3) diffusion and translation of information. A total of 135 indicators were built on seven themes: (1) demographic, socioeconomic, and aging conditions, (2) health, (3) functional dependence, (4) healthy aging, (5) health services, (6) social and physical environments, and (7) complex indicators. SIESDE is an effective system for providing an overall view of health, aging, and functional dependence.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the factors associated with outsourcing of information systems (IS) in hospital-based health care delivery systems, and to determine if there is a difference in IS outsourcing activity based on the strategic value of the outsourced functions. IS sourcing behavior is conceptualized as a case of vertical integration. A synthesis of strategic management theory (SMT) and transaction cost economics (TCE) serves as the theoretical framework. The sample consists of 1,365 hospital-based health care delivery systems that own 3,452 hospitals operating in 2004. The findings indicate that neither TCE nor SMT predicted outsourcing better than the other did. The findings also suggest that health care delivery system managers may not be considering significant factors when making sourcing decisions, including the relative strategic value of the functions they are outsourcing. It is consistent with previous literature to suggest that the high cost of IS may be the main factor driving the outsourcing decision.",

We devised two indicators: the percentage of time under mechanical ventilation with excessive tidal volume (>8mL/kg predicted body weight) and the percentage of patients who received appropriate tidal volume (≤8mL/kg PBW) at least 80% of the time under mechanical ventilation. We developed an algorithm to automatically calculate these indicators from clinical information system data and analyzed associations between them and patients' characteristics and outcomes. This study has been carried out in our 30-bed polyvalent intensive care unit between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2019. All patients admitted to intensive care unit ventilated >72h were included. Use data collected automatically from the clinical information systems to assess adherence to tidal volume recommendations and its outcomes. Mechanical ventilation days, ICU length of stay and mortality. Of all admitted patients, 340 met the inclusion criteria. Median percentage of time under mechanical ventilation with excessive tidal volume was 70% (23%-93%); only 22.3% of patients received appropriate tidal volume at least 80% of the time. Receiving appropriate tidal volume was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay. Patients receiving appropriate tidal volume were mostly male, younger, taller, and less severely ill. Adjusted intensive care unit mortality did not differ according to percentage of time with excessive tidal volume or to receiving appropriate tidal volume at least 80% of the time. Automatic calculation of process-of-care indicators from clinical information systems high-resolution data can provide an accurate and continuous measure of adherence to recommendations. Adherence to tidal volume recommendations was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay.",

Site conditions and landscape context are critical factors influencing the functions that created wetlands perform. We developed a spatial model and used a geographic information system (GIS) to identify suitable locations for wetland mitigation sites. The model used six variables to characterize site conditions: hydrology, soils, historic condition, vegetation cover, adjacent vegetation, and land use. For each variable, a set of suitability scores was developed that indicated the wetland establishment potential for different variable states. Composite suitability scores for individual points on the landscape were determined from the weighted geometric mean of suitability scores for each variable at each point. These composite scores were grouped into five classes and mapped as a wetland mitigation suitability surface with a GIS. Sites with high suitability scores were further evaluated using information on the feasibility of site modification and project cost. This modeling approach could be adapted by planners for use in identifying the suitability of locations as wetland mitigation sites at any site or region.",

    "title": "Adopting electronic medical records in primary care: lessons learned from health information systems implementation experience in seven countries.",
    "abstract": "The adoption of health information systems is seen world wide as one method to mitigate the widening health care demand and supply gap. The purpose of this review was to identify the current state of knowledge about health information systems adoption in primary care. The goal was to understand factors and influencers affecting implementation outcomes from previous health information systems implementations experiences. A comprehensive systematic literature review of peer reviewed and grey literature was undertaken to identify the current state of knowledge regarding the implementation of health information systems. A total of 6 databases, 27 journal websites, 20 websites from grey sources, 9 websites from medical colleges and professional associations as well as 22 government/commission websites were searched. The searches returned almost 3700 article titles. Eighty-six articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles show that systems' graphical user interface design quality, feature functionality, project management, procurement and users' previous experience affect implementation outcomes. Implementers had concerns about factors such as privacy, patient safety, provider/patient relations, staff anxiety, time factors, quality of care, finances, efficiency, and liability. The review showed that implementers can insulate the project from such concerns by establishing strong leadership, using project management techniques, establishing standards and training their staff to ensure such risks do not compromise implementation success. The review revealed the concept of socio-technical factors, or \"fit\" factors, that complicate health information systems deployment. The socio-technical perspective considers how the technical features of a health information system interact with the social features of a health care work environment. The review showed that quality of care, patient safety and provider/patient relations were not, positively or negatively, affected by systems implementation. The fact that no articles were found reviewing the benefits or drawbacks of health information systems accruing to patients should be concern to adopters, payers and jurisdictions. No studies were found that compared how provider-patient interactions in interviews are effected when providers used electronic health information systems as opposed to the paper equivalent. Very little information was available about privacy and liability.",

    "title": "A proposed expert system for nursing practice. A springboard to nursing science.",
    "abstract": "The knowledge on which nursing practice is based comes largely from traditional sources, expert nurses passing on the wisdom of their experience to novices. Nursing research, although increasing, is usually parallel to nursing practice, and its findings, at best, are implemented only after long delays. Consequently, the most effective nursing responses to a particular client problem may be undiscovered or unknown. Nursing information systems reflect the nature and usage of nursing knowledge. They offer standard care plans, but the knowledge and decision structures for individualizing care remain exclusively in the mind of the nurse. Nurses may have great freedom to enter information into the information system, but the information is rarely retrievable in a form suitable for evaluation or research. Nursing practice, and the knowledge on which it is based, could be enhanced through the use of a novel expert system. This paper describes how such a system could be developed, with examples from the authors' prototype programs. Taxonomies of data, diagnoses, objectives, and interventions would make it possible to compare patients and to determine the relative effectiveness of nursing interventions. A built-in evaluation component would provide feedback and correction. Everyday nursing practice would become a field for research, and the knowledge gained from research would immediately be fed back into practice. In its development and in its implementation, this kind of system would help to build nursing science.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high costs involved and the lack of definitive evidence of sustained effectiveness, many low- and middle-income countries had begun to strengthen their health information system using information and communication technology in the past few decades. Following this international trend, the Malaysian Ministry of Health had been incorporating Telehealth (National Telehealth initiatives) into national health policies since the 1990s. Employing qualitative approaches, including key informant interviews and document review, this study examines the agenda-setting processes of the Telehealth policy using Kingdon's framework. The findings suggested that Telehealth policies emerged through actions of policy entrepreneurs within the Ministry of Health, who took advantage of several simultaneously occurring opportunities--official recognition of problems within the existing health information system, availability of information and communication technology to strengthen health information system and political interests surrounding the national Multimedia Super Corridor initiative being developed at the time. The last was achieved by the inclusion of Telehealth as a component of the Multimedia Super Corridor.",

Following a carefully delinated plan for the acquisition of an LIS is a lengthy and time consuming task, but one well worth the effort. This process could take several years to complete from concept to implementation, but the selection of the right vendor will ultimately save the institution money by reducing costs, increasing personnel efficiency and improving the quality of care. In the end, improved patient care will allow the institution to grow and develop projects that serve the patient population outside of the institution's walls. The purchase of a computer system for the laboratory is one of the most taxing procedures that laboratory and hospital personnel will undertake, but one well worth the effort if done properly. Poor planning of the acquisition will only lead to increased costs and frustrations. Do it right the first time.",

Remote data access for authorized users is also considered. As clinical application, we describe here the prototype of a user-oriented clinical information system for the archiving and the management of multimedia and temporally oriented clinical data related to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) patients.

    "title": "An evaluation of the Sinan health information system as used by the Hansen's disease control programme, Pernambuco State, Brazil.",
    "abstract": "Since the introduction of the national notifiable diseases information system (SINAN) in Pernambuco State, Brazil, in 1994, many problems have been encountered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the SINAN software, quality of data input, the transfer of the computerised data from the municipality to state levels, human resources and other factors associated with the health information system infrastructure (HIS). A cross-sectional study was carried out in Pernambuco state, North-eastern Brazil, in 2005. A sample of health regions and municipalities was chosen. SINAN forms from those municipalities were analysed and the flow of notifications followed from municipal level to the regional and finally to the state. Professionals from health units, district, municipal and regional Hansen's Disease Control Programme (HDCP) and Epidemiological Surveillance System (ESS) coordinators, health secretaries and managers of the municipalities and health regions selected were interviewed. SINAN software is functioning up to expectation. However, at all levels of the health system, serious weaknesses not related to the SINAN software were found, varying from lack of human resources (limited number of staff and staff development), lack of infrastructure (office space, computers, supplies, etc.) to an absence of effective coordination, management and supervision of the HIS. Lack of reliable, complete and timely information, and especially the lack of widespread analysis and use of available information in planning and management of health services were the main weaknesses found. Many areas need urgent attention: the quality of patient examination, recording and reporting, the timely processing of quality data, the coordination and management of disease control programmes, and the use of HIS reports by the health services and health managers. Regular feedback, supportive supervision visits and annual reviews are essential to monitor the system and make sure that essential information is decentralised and used by the primary health services and HDCP coordination. Assessing the quality of services from a client perspective would give additional information for the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the Hansen's disease (leprosy) services.",

The aim of this paper is to review published articles in the area evaluations of IT-based systems in order to gain knowledge about methodologies used and findings obtained from the evaluation of IT-based systems applied in healthcare settings. The literature review includes studies of IT-based systems between 2003 and 2005. The findings show that economic and organizational aspects dominate evaluation studies in this area. However, the results focus mostly on positive outputs such as user satisfaction, financial benefits and improved organizational work. This review shows that there is no standard framework for evaluation effects and outputs of implementation and use of IT in the healthcare setting and that until today no studies explore the impact of IT on the healthcare system' productivity and effectiveness.",

    "title": "Assessing the feasibility of a mobile health-supported clinical decision support system for nutritional triage in oncology outpatients using Arden Syntax.",
    "abstract": "Nutritional screening procedures followed by regular nutrition monitoring for oncological outpatients are no standard practice in many European hospital wards and outpatient settings. As a result, early signs of malnutrition are missed and nutritional treatment is initiated when patients have already experienced severe weight loss. We report on a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the global assessment and nutritional triage of the nutritional condition of oncology outpatients. The system combines clinical and laboratory data collected in the clinical setting with patient-generated data from a smartphone application for monitoring the patients' nutritional status. Our objective is to assess the feasibility of a CDSS that combines the aforementioned data sources and describe its integration into a hospital information system. Furthermore, we collected patients' opinions on the value of the system, and whether they would regard the system as a useful aid in coping with their condition. The system implements the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) to monitor nutritional status in the outpatient setting. A smartphone application is used to collect patient-generated data by performing weekly mini-surveys on patients concerning their eating habits, weight, and overall well-being. Data are uploaded on completion of each mini-survey and stored on a secure server at the Medical University of Vienna (MUV). The data are then combined with relevant clinical information from the Vienna General Hospital (VGH) information system. The knowledge base for the CDSS is implemented in medical logic modules (MLMs) using Arden Syntax. A three-month pilot clinical trial was performed to test the feasibility of the system. Qualitative questionnaires were used to obtain the patients' opinions on the usability and personal value of the system during the four-week test period. We used the existing separation between the scientific and clinical data domains in the secured network environment (SNE) at the MUV and VGH to our advantage by importing, storing, and processing both patient-generated and routine data in the scientific data domain. To limit exposure to the SNE, patient-generated data stored outside the SNE were imported to the scientific domain once a day. The CDSS created for nutritional assessment and triage comprised ten MLMs, each including either a sub-assessment or the final results of the PG-SGA. Finally, an interface created for the hospital information system showed the results directly in clinical routine. In all 22 patients completed the clinical study. The results of the questionnaires showed that 91% of the patients were generally happy with the usability of the system, 91% believed that the application was of additional value in detecting cancer-related malnutrition, and 82% found it helpful as a long-term monitoring tool. Despite strict protection of the clinical data domain, a CDSS employing patient-generated data can be integrated into clinical routine. The CDSS discussed in this report combined the information entered into a smartphone application with clinical data in order to inform the physician of a patient's nutritional status and thus permit suitable and timely intervention. The initial results show that the smartphone application was well accepted by patients, who considered it useful, but not many oncological outpatients were willing to participate in the clinical study because they did not possess an Android phone or lacked smartphone expertise. Furthermore, the results indicate that patient-generated data could be employed to augment clinical data and calculate metrics such as the PG-SGA without excessive effort by using a secure intermediate location as the locus of data storage and processing.",

The damage potential is proportional to the population characteristics of the location as well as various meteorological factors and geographical features. For the risk assessment of ammonia toxicity, the storage facility at Eloor industrial area is taken as a sample. Pollutant dispersion model - Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA) is utilized to predict the toxicity impacted distance of ammonia. The model estimates the vulnerable areas, which may be affected toxically by an Ammonia release by integrating information about chemical properties of the substance, weather conditions prevalent in the area and release conditions. Risk assessment is done for four different atmospheric conditions, typical to the prevailing seasons and affected area is estimated in each scenario. To determine the affected population, the areal interpolation method in GIS database is also employed in this study, which illustrates the toxically impacted areas and the population in need of immediate help and evacuation. Such studies can serve as an effective tool for decision makers to prepare an emergency plan in case of accidental releases.",

    "abstract": "For landslide susceptibility mapping, this study applied and verified a Bayesian probability model, a likelihood ratio and statistical model, and logistic regression to Janghung, Korea, using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Landslide locations were identified in the study area from interpretation of IRS satellite imagery and field surveys; and a spatial database was constructed from topographic maps, soil type, forest cover, geology and land cover. The factors that influence landslide occurrence, such as slope gradient, slope aspect, and curvature of topography, were calculated from the topographic database. Soil texture, material, drainage, and effective depth were extracted from the soil database, while forest type, diameter, and density were extracted from the forest database. Land cover was classified from Landsat TM satellite imagery using unsupervised classification. The likelihood ratio and logistic regression coefficient were overlaid to determine each factor's rating for landslide susceptibility mapping. Then the landslide susceptibility map was verified and compared with known landslide locations. The logistic regression model had higher prediction accuracy than the likelihood ratio model. The method can be used to reduce hazards associated with landslides and to land cover planning.",

MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases were searched from 1994 to 2005 using the following combination of descriptors: \"SINASC\", \"live birth\", \"Brazil\". We identified 157 abstracts within the reference period, among which 44 were selected and classified according to specific criteria. The number of articles published per year increased during the period studied. The majority of the studies was carried out in the Southeast region and used the municipality as the geographic unity of analysis. A varied range of subjects were assessed including descriptions of live births profiles, health service and programs evaluations and risk factors for infant outcomes. In conclusion, although the SINASC represents an important data source for maternal-infant health research, the system's coverage and the reliability of its data need to be better evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The published medical literature and online medical resources are important sources to help physicians make patient treatment decisions. Traditional sources used for information retrieval (e.g., PubMed) often return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents from large knowledge repositories is large and makes information seeking practical only \"after hours\" and not in the clinical setting. This study developed novel algorithms, and designed, implemented, and evaluated a medical definitional question answering system (MedQA). MedQA automatically analyzed a large number of electronic documents to generate short and coherent answers in response to definitional questions (i.e., questions with the format of \"What is X?\"). Our preliminary cognitive evaluation shows that MedQA out-performed three other online information systems (Google, OneLook, and PubMed) in two important efficiency criteria; namely, time spent and number of actions taken for a physician to identify a definition. It is our contention that question answering systems that aggregate pertinent information scattered across different documents have the potential to address clinical information needs within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of clinicians.",

    "title": "Standardization and security for the EMR.",
    "abstract": "The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan announced 'Healthcare Information Strategy 21' in 1994. This report shows that the Healthcare Information System is the key to improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare. One of the elements for realizing the new Healthcare Information System is the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Following the publication of this report, work began with the aim of discovering a way to recognize the EMR as formal documentation and four national projects of research and development have been started. The themes of these projects are: 'Interoperability of EMR', 'Standardization of EMR', 'Modeling of the Clinical Process' and 'Security for EMR'. The Japanese Association of the Healthcare Information Systems Industry (JAHIS) is in charge of 'Security for EMR'. There are many discussions in relation to the security for EMR. However, many of these discussions relate to information technology, while there are few discussions regarding definitions of security. Therefore, there are many different theories about security itself, which will be an obstacle to standardization. To design the security system for EMR, JAHIS has defined 'Security for EMR' as the first step. The present study was conducted with medical informatics and security specialists. It has designed 'Requirement Definitions', 'Goals of Security', 'Estimation of threats to security', 'Necessity conditions' and a 'Security Model'. This paper covers these definitions and our security design concept.",

    "abstract": "The Cancer Information Service Research Consortium (CISRC) was funded by the National Cancer Institute to disseminate as a pilot study a longitudinally tailored print intervention to promote the 5 A Day for Better Health program among callers to the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS). Using a one-group (intervention-only) study design, 1,022 eligible CIS callers were enrolled to receive the intervention consisting of four mailings of tailored print materials over a 3-month period. Program evaluation focused on process and implementation evaluation, including adherence to the baseline interviews by CIS information specialists based on live-call monitoring (n = 55 eligible callers), and the timeliness of the intervention mailouts (4,088 scheduled mailouts). Adherence to the baseline interviews by CIS information specialists was extremely high, exceeding 90% for all indicators of quality control. Of the 4,088 intervention mailings, 75% occurred on or before the target date, while 95% occurred within 21 days of the target date. All delays in the scheduled mailouts occurred in the first mailing, due to changes made in the production process (batch printing of all tailored print materials at baseline). This change required additional system upgrades and more intensive and time-consuming quality control than originally anticipated, which was exacerbated by the faster-than-expected accrual of eligible participants. Based on this pilot study, the CIS is now positioned for widespread dissemination of the 5 A Day tailored print intervention. Several key lessons learned are also identified to facilitate the transition from research to dissemination.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of health actions requires large amounts of information allowing an assessment of relevance, coherence, efficacy, efficiency and impact of these interventions. Information systems should support evaluation processes by helping to obtain pertinent indicators, tracers and standard operating procedures. To reach this objective, specific functions need to be implemented, including traceability, documentation, investigation and scientific awareness. But this supposes that health information systems respect quality criteria that this article defines. The following criteria are considered: simplicity, validity, acceptability, informative value, representativeness, continuity, reactivity, fluidity, flexibility of the system, and also confidentiality of information. The historical developments of medical informatics have induced the creation of independent information systems, answering to specific objectives. This lack of integration is an obstacle to the evaluation of health actions because of the difficulty to view transversally and longitudinally the sequence of actions for a same patient. Thus integrated health information systems, organised around patient care episodes, are necessary to support evaluation and to contribute effectively to decision making in public health, because the evaluation of health actions implies the availability of information about the individuals who are the targets of these actions.",

In this regard Amharic localization in open-source database can handle the difficulties in managing data for governmental and non-governmental organizations. Amharic Extension Module was introduced to governmental organizations for the data management capabilities. But, there is no research that can explore the system's quality, the users' satisfaction and intension of continuance of Amharic Extension Module from the perspective of both computer literates and illiterates. Therefore, this research work attempt or try to empirically examine and analyze the system quality, the users' satisfaction and intension of continuance of Amharic Extension Module from the perspective of all users in POESSA The major purpose/aim of this study/research is to brand or make up the research break/gap in the area of localization specific to the Amharic locals, and to show the implication of the practical and theoretical way based on the results of the research. For this purpose, questionnaires were used for the collection of the research data. A total of 395 copies of the questionnaires were distributed and 385 of them are collected without any problem from the organization indicated herewith. The statistical analysis tools such as SPSS and AMOS, and methods such as Structural equation model were used for the analysis of the research data. The results of the research recommended and suggested that system quality can significantly influence confirmation. Meanwhile, confirmation can directly and significantly influence perceived usefulness, performance expectations, and satisfaction. Additionally, performance expectation, perceived usefulness and confirmation can significantly impact/influence satisfaction. The satisfaction directly and most importantly and significantly influences the continuance intension. Finally, the research delivers/provides a concert indication for the legitimacy and validity of the integrated and combined models of UTUAT, ECTM, and D&M ISS in the field of localizations which can be a hypothetical and theoretical foundation for Amharic Extension Module-AEM users' and services of it.",

    "title": "Information society in Czech healthcare 'starting point' to prognosis for the year 2013.",
    "abstract": "A prognosis of how the information society in health care will look like in 2013 must start from the current state of affairs at the given locality regarding healthcare management by public authorities including legislative, ICT technological levels and accessibility of professional knowledge in individual fields of medicine. It is presumed that after 10 years the influence of this 'starting point' will still persist and knowledge of the current state of affairs will be needed to positively but also negatively differentiates the prognosis [Health Care in the Information Society: A Prognosis for the Year 2013, in this issue] for individual localities, e.g. Germany versus neighbouring the Czech Republic. The present article focuses on aims of Czech health care and the measures that are taken in Czech health care that are carried out and which have been already initiated. Their significance towards the future prognosis according to [Health Care in the Information Society: A Prognosis for the Year 2013, in this issue] is clear. The first measure is legalisation of conditions, which allow health care administration only be carried out with electronic forms and the protection of these sensitive personal data when they are placed in a centralised data depository where they are prepared for physicians who use them while providing health care in health institutions. In the Czech Republic an information system is developed called Internet Access to Health Patient Information (IHPI). The second measure is creating a unified central system of health information together with methodologies for data collection, data standards and protocols. In the Czech Republic there is the National Health Information System (NHIS) governed by the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (IHIS CR). The NHIS enables care providers to get information about the health state of citizens, about health institutions, about their activities and economics, it enables to regulate the provision of health care, to define conceptions of state health politics and to administrate public health. The third measure is legalisation of possibilities to establish centralised health care registers that are designated for recording and following of patients with chosen socially serious diseases. These registers help with diagnosis and therapy and reveal consequences of diseases for the patients. It helps to evaluate accessibility and quality of provided health care in the country. An important goal of the use of health care registers and information systems is for educational purposes and as causal expert systems for physicians. The National Health Registers have been introduced to the whole of the Czech Republic; some of them are accessible on-line in a countrywide data network. The last part of the paper focuses on research and education for developing the information society in Czech health care and on co-operation with EU countries in selected projects and initiatives.",

The systems covered a broad range of objectives, used variable approaches and operated at very different scales and budgets. There was a high level of awareness and involvement by the industry. Common weaknesses of the systems were the lack of in-depth quantitative analysis of the data, the lack of assessment of each system's impact, and the unknown level of bias as a result of the voluntary or selective participation in them.",

    "title": "Weaving the Web into legacy information systems.",
    "abstract": "For many years, client-server systems were developed as the backbone of clinical computing in leading hospitals around the country. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center now faces the challenge of bridging the technology gap between such systems and the Internet. While developing Web interfaces to legacy clinical systems gives a taste of the future, it is clear that complete institutional migration to the Web is not imminent. Asking clinicians to utilize two different systems, Web-based and legacy, in the interim phase is just one of the difficulties in such transition. This paper describes \"Mbridge\", a solution that allows legacy system users to exploit the benefits of the Internet in a fashion that does not interfere with their workflow and is both simple and affordable to implement. The service allows clinicians to work on the legacy platform while context-sensitive clinical content is streamed to the browser without their intervention. Using the system, we can gradually expose clinicians to new Web-based applications and resources without forcing them to operate two computing environments simultaneously. The service achieves these goals by means of linkage and coordination rather than by code-translation, data exchange or replication.",

Lessons can be learned from these evaluation studies by identifying the most important factors of HIS adoption. In order to study the adoption issue, a qualitative systematic review has been performed using a recently introduced framework, known as HOT-fit (Human, Organisation and Technology fit). The paper identifies and highlights the following critical adoption factors: technology (ease of use, system usefulness, system flexibility, time efficiency, information accessibility and relevancy); human (user training, user perception, user roles, user skills, clarity of system purpose, user involvement); organisation (leadership and support, clinical process, user involvement, internal communication, inter organisational system, as well as the fit between them.

The system samples and multiplexes up to 240 low-bandwidth analog channels with a camera video signal, and outputs a standard composite video signal containing analog and video data. The combined signals can be stored on video tape or can be digitized by an inexpensive framegrabber. The circuitry separates horizontal synchronizing pulses from a camera output; the pulses increment a counter that sequentially selects each electrophysiological channel on a sample-and-hold multiplexer. The intensity of each horizontal scan line from the multiplexer output represents the amplitude of one sample of each physiological channel. This signal is then multiplexed with the video signal, such that a portion of each video horizontal line represents the physiological data. The combined output is stored together, providing a means for synchronizing the two signals during analysis. The design allows easy coordination of electrophysiological events with video images from a standard video camera, avoiding the necessity for separate analog to digital circuitry for physiological and video signal storage on computer media, as well as the need for complex synchronization of the data from different media.",

    "abstract": "Hospital information systems are often huge and heterogeneous systems. To support physicians with their daily clinical work, application systems are developed which are dedicated to particular medical fields or tasks and which have to be integrated into the hospital information system. The integration process is quite complicated, because it makes the information system's infrastructure even more heterogeneous. We developed an application system for documentation and therapy planning in pediatric oncology (DOSPO) and we started to introduce it into the Department of Pediatric Oncology of Heidelberg University Hospital. The fact that DOSPO is developed as a universal system for nationwide use made the integration process more difficult. In any case, the introduction of specialized application systems has to be planned systematically in advance, regarding the prevailing information system's infrastructure, available resources and established processes. To simplify the integration process comprehensive electronic patient records for the future should be designed in a way that they can be enhanced easily by new clinical functions.",

    "abstract": "The entire face of modern medical and surgical practice is being significantly affected by the application of technologic developments to the practice of surgery--developments that will tie together such areas as information management and processing, robotics, communication networks, and computerized surgical equipment. The achievements in these areas will create a sophisticated, fully automatic system that will assist the plastic surgeon in many aspects of work, such as regular office activities, doctor-patient interaction, professional updating, communication, and even assistance during the operational process itself. It will be as simple as dialing a telephone today. When it is necessary to consult with other colleagues, a combined vocal and visual consulting network in other medical centers as well as consulting computerized expert systems will be available all day and night as part of the communication services. The plastic surgical expert systems will store valuable information, based on the knowledge of the best human experts, on any important subtopics and will be accessed in a very friendly way. This will be an invaluable tool for the residents in training, for emergency room work, and for just getting a second opinion, even for the more experienced practitioner. All the electronic mail, professional magazines, and any other required professional information will flow between central and personal retrieval systems. The doctor, at a desired time in the privacy and comfort of his or her own home or office, can read the mail, make required changes to suit his or her needs, and store, send back, or distribute information, all in a speedy and efficient manner. The simulation of a planned surgery will give the surgeon the ability to prepare and will prevent difficulties during complicated procedures through the luxury of a dry run, without any sequelae if certain expected outcomes fail to materialize. The preprogrammed control of sophisticated surgical equipment and the use of robotics would generate new operational possibilities for more complicated surgeries, which are now prevented owing to the surgeon's physical limitations. Information urgently required during the operation as a result of an unexpected situation will be available immediately from storage and retrieval systems, and real-time vocal and visual consulting with expert colleagues, often in remote locations, will bring the operations process itself to a new era.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Heat wave early warning systems help alert decision-makers and the public to prepare for hot weather and implement preventive actions to protect health. Prior to harmonization, public health units across Ontario either used independent systems with varying methodologies for triggering and issuing public heat warnings or did not use any system. The federal government also issued heat warnings based on different criteria. During heat events, adjacent public health units in Ontario and the federal government would routinely call heat warnings at different times with separate public messages, leading to confusion. This article describes the collaborative process and key steps in developing a harmonized Heat Warning and Information System (HWIS) for Ontario. Public health units across Ontario, Canada, collaborated with the federal and provincial government to develop the harmonized HWIS for Ontario. In 2011, stakeholders identified the need to develop a harmonized system across Ontario to improve heat warning services, warning criteria, and health messaging. Through a 5-year process facilitated by a non-governmental organization, the three levels of government collaborated to establish the Ontario HWIS. The province-wide HWIS was implemented in 2016 with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's release of the harmonized HWIS Standard Operating Practice, which outlined the notification and warning process. The lessons learned could help spur action in other provinces and jurisdictions internationally in the development of similar health evidence-based warning systems, including in particular those for protecting public health during extreme heat events.",

To support resettlement and integration, refugees undergo a pre-arrival medical health assessment (MHA), which is used for healthcare planning by local government in England. This study aimed to understand the utility and effectiveness of the MHA and flow of data to support resettlement planning. Seven local government representatives were interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions of the refugee health information system (HIS) and the MHA for resettlement in England. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. The three themes indicated that the HIS was perceived to be effective, however, issues on governance, timeliness of information and access were identified. Findings showed that for the MHA to be more useful for planning, assessments for mental health issues and child special educational needs (SEN) are needed. Findings also indicated resettlement promoted joint working and acceptability of refugee resettlement. In areas where data sharing and governance processes are well defined, the HIS is effective and the MHA supports resettlement. National agencies should put structures in place to support timely health information flow.",

The scope of this paper was to evaluate the quality of data about live births and deaths in the neonatal period in the Live Births Information System (SINASC) and Mortality Information System (SIM) in the state of Espírito Santo during the period from 2007 to 2009. Descriptive methodology with secondary data obtained from the electronic address of the Informatics Department of the Unified Health System was used to analyze the dimensions of quality of information, namely accessibility, timeliness and completeness. The results indicate that the information is accessible and timely, with a lag of three years compared to the beginning of the study. The completeness of the variables analyzed in SINASC was predominantly classified as excellent. SIM revealed a high percentage of missing data on the number of the Live Birth Declaration, mother's education, age and reproductive history. The conclusion reached is that SINASC is an excellent source of information about births, though SIM reveals a marked need for improvements in the completeness of its information.",

We explore an alternative approach to visualizing and understanding disability that takes into account the diversity of personal abilities, the diversity of digital equipment and equally important, the situation (environmental, psychological, and digital) in which the information system is used. The most important implications of this work are twofold. First, this work will contribute to the need for Universal Design to take into account not only the diversity of abilities and impairments of the users that are tangible and recognizable in the physical environment, but also the diversity of digital equipment and usage situations. Second, as part of the systems development cycle, in user testing of digital services, this work highlights the essential need to not only involve a diverse set of users, but also to conduct testing in diverse digital environments (smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs), and in diverse realistic usage scenarios, including strong sunlight or low light situation, as well as tired, alert, stressed or distracted, and slow network. The proposed model attempts to give a more holistic view and promote a more comprehensive understanding of the disabilities that can occur during use of digital services or mediated communication in daily life.",

    "title": "Establishing an Interoperable Clinical Trial Information System Within MIRACUM.",
    "abstract": "In the long-run we wish to demonstrate the power of linking clinical trial information to routine health records for straightforward patient recruitment - not only at each single hospital but in a large German consortium (called MIRACUM). In such architecture a hospital wide clinical trial registry (CTR) plays a major role. All such site specific CTR however, also need to be interoperable and support automated data provision for a central MIRACUM wide trial registry. Based on a survey of already existing trial information systems at each partner site and a comparison of their functionality, a joint requirement specification was created, a minimal MIRACUM wide trial core dataset was defined and an architecture was designed in which each MIRACUM partner could keep their autonomous system decision. Partners could however also join forces in a cooperative enhancement of a new open source trial registry. Thus, sites with no trial registry could be supported by the others and synergies used. Finally, the newly developed CTR will allow modular site specific add-ons and can also take over the function of the MIRACUM wide trial registry. In this paper we describe the process, how such a consortium-wide CTR was designed and developed, while always keeping cross-site interoperability as a major requirement.",

Coverage of the data by municipality was estimated as the ratio between reported and estimated live births. Data quality in the SINASC was assessed via probabilistic linkage with the database from the Birth in Brazil study, 2011-2012, and kappa coefficients of agreement were calculated. In 2013, data coverage was high and homogeneous in all states of Brazil. However, the analysis according to municipalities (counties) showed greater spatial heterogeneity. As for completeness of information in SINASC, kappa coefficients were statistically different from zero for all the tested variables (p < 0.001), and marginal distributions of all the variables were similar in the two databases. Gestational age was the variable with the worst agreement, with a kappa value of 0.461. The indicator that describes the inconsistencies, measured by the sum of the square of the differences between the reported and expected prematurity rates by birthweight bracket, showed the highest value in the North of Brazil and the lowest in the South, pointing to geographic inequalities in measurement of gestational age.",

    "abstract": "The study was part of a survey conducted in clusters of Brazilian municipalities (counties) characterized by serious underreporting of deaths, with the objective of estimating infant mortality in these areas in 2000. The article discusses the principal sources of information on infant deaths in these municipalities, as well as some problems related to the implementation of the Mortality Data System (SIM). The methodology included an active search for deaths in previously registered official and unofficial sources, which identified 344 deaths not processed in the SIM (66% of total deaths). There were a low percentage of deaths processed in the SIM and coming from official sources (notary public offices and healthcare facilities), thus highlighting problems with reporting of deaths, issuing of death certificates, and data flows. The important contribution by the Community Health Agents Program/ Family Health Program points to the need for active data search in this source as a routine activity in municipalities with underreporting of data. Insufficient training of professionals and high staff turnover were major issues in the system's deficient implementation.",

A descriptive analysis was used to examine New York State data on the opioid crisis in comparison to outcome data from GIS maps of opioid use in two boroughs in New York City. Web-based modules were designed for analysis of GIS maps of opioid use near practice settings. New York State data provided context for local opioiduse, while GIS maps identified specific areas of the New York City boroughs that were most affected by the opioid epidemic. The importance of local GIS maps is that the information is available in real-time, and thus interventions can be designed, evaluated, and changed quickly to meet the immediate needs of the community.",

    "abstract": "Governments around the globe are paving the way for healthcare services that can have a profound impact on the overall well-being and development of their nations. However, government programs to implement health information technologies on a large-scale are challenging, especially in developing countries. In this article, the process and outcomes of the large-scale implementation of a hospital information system for the management of Brazilian university hospitals are analyzed. Based on a qualitative approach, this research involved 21 hospitals and comprised a documentary search, interviews with 24 hospital managers and two system user focus groups, and a questionnaire of 736 respondents. Generally, we observed that aspects relating to the wider context of system implementation (macro level), the managerial structure, cultural nuances, and political dynamics within each hospital (meso level), as well as the technology, work activities, and individuals themselves (micro level) acted as facilitators and/or obstacles to the implementation process. The dynamics and complex interactions established between these aspects had repercussions on the process, including the extended time necessary to implement the national program and the somewhat mixed outcomes obtained by hospitals in the national network. Mostly positive, these outcomes were linked to the eight emerging dimensions of practices and work processes; planning, control, and decision making; transparency and accountability; optimization in the use of resources; productivity of professionals; patient information security; safety and quality of care; and improvement in teaching and research. We argued here that to maximize the potential of information technology in healthcare on a large-scale, an integrative and cooperative vision is required, along with a high capacity for change management, considering the different regional, local, and institutional contexts.",

For example, the judgment of pulmonary nodules mainly relies on artificial experience, and most of the artificial experience is too radical. This paper is mainly based on the extensive medical data of significant hospitals, extracts the diagnosis and treatment data and digital images of similar cases from the extensive database, classifies them through the deep learning of the computer, and then proposes the control mechanism and the solution of the doctor's misjudgement and excessive medical treatment. This method mainly relies on the CT and MRI digital images of various types of tumor diseases accumulated in the history of major hospitals. Based on the preliminary judgment of each diagnosis and treatment and the results of surgical and pathological examinations, the accumulation of various types of digital images from the history is used. The features are analysed and extracted, the model is built, and finally, a predictive analysis system for this type of tumor is obtained, which can predict the benign and malignant cases of currently occurring cases and avoid the limitations and instability of artificial experience greatest extent. It is proved by experiments and combined with Spearman to remove redundancy. The redundancy removal method SVM_RFE is used for dimensionality reduction. The method can timely correct the misjudgement of the doctor's experience and effectively reduce the instability of the manual, which provides a solution for solving the contradiction between doctors and patients and improving the scientific of diagnosis and treatment.",

Ten municipalities were selected from the State's five meso-regions, five of which entered information into the system and five only on an irregular basis. Semi-structured interviews were performed with the municipal health secretaries. Analysis of the data showed that command of information technology and knowledge of the System do not affect the regularity of data entry, as a function of the distance between the Municipal Health Secretariat administrators and the SIOPS, such that the data are normally entered by outsourced services. Thus, the resulting information has not been fully explored by systems administrators as a management tool.",

Dimensions evaluated included accessibility, methodological clarity, coverage, completeness, reliability, consistency, non-duplication, timeliness, validity, and studies on ill-defined causes/garbage codes. Among the 33 included articles, a general improvement in SIM quality was observed, with a 68.5% reduction in garbage codes (2000-2015). However, regional inequalities in SIM persist, with coverage below 90% in Acre and Maranhão and poorer performance in the North and Northeast regions.

    "abstract": "In February 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination of all U.S. infants with 3 doses of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. In June 2008, ACIP updated its recommendations to include use of a second rotavirus vaccine, a 2-dose monovalent vaccine, administered at ages 2 and 4 months. The maximum age for the first dose of either rotavirus vaccine (RV) is 14 weeks and 6 days. CDC recently analyzed data from Immunization Information System (IIS) sentinel sites 1) to assess trends in coverage with >or=1 dose of RV during June 2006--June 2009 among infants aged 5 months and 2) to compare RV coverage in the second quarter of 2009 with that of two other routinely-recommended vaccines for U.S. infants: diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). RV coverage increased following vaccine introduction and, in June 2009, averaged 72% at the eight currently participating IIS sentinel sites. However, >or=1 dose RV coverage among infants aged 5 months was 13% lower than the average coverage with >or=1 dose of DTaP and PCV7 at these same sites. Lower RV coverage could reflect typical new-vaccine coverage dynamics, the presence of RV-specific barriers, or both. Identifying and reducing barriers to vaccination and educating parents and providers about the health benefits of rotavirus vaccination should increase coverage and help prevent severe rotavirus disease.",

    "abstract": "There is a huge demand on bioinformaticians to provide their biologists with user friendly and scalable software infrastructures to capture, exchange, and exploit the unprecedented amounts of new *omics data. We here present MOLGENIS, a generic, open source, software toolkit to quickly produce the bespoke MOLecular GENetics Information Systems needed. The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple language to model biological data structures and user interfaces. At the push of a button, MOLGENIS' generator suite automatically translates these models into a feature-rich, ready-to-use web application including database, user interfaces, exchange formats, and scriptable interfaces. Each generator is a template of SQL, JAVA, R, or HTML code that would require much effort to write by hand. This 'model-driven' method ensures reuse of best practices and improves quality because the modeling language and generators are shared between all MOLGENIS applications, so that errors are found quickly and improvements are shared easily by a re-generation. A plug-in mechanism ensures that both the generator suite and generated product can be customized just as much as hand-written software. In recent years we have successfully evaluated the MOLGENIS toolkit for the rapid prototyping of many types of biomedical applications, including next-generation sequencing, GWAS, QTL, proteomics and biobanking. Writing 500 lines of model XML typically replaces 15,000 lines of hand-written programming code, which allows for quick adaptation if the information system is not yet to the biologist's satisfaction. Each application generated with MOLGENIS comes with an optimized database back-end, user interfaces for biologists to manage and exploit their data, programming interfaces for bioinformaticians to script analysis tools in R, Java, SOAP, REST/JSON and RDF, a tab-delimited file format to ease upload and exchange of data, and detailed technical documentation. Existing databases can be quickly enhanced with MOLGENIS generated interfaces using the 'ExtractModel' procedure. The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple model to quickly generate flexible web platforms for all possible genomic, molecular and phenotypic experiments with a richness of interfaces not provided by other tools. All the software and manuals are available free as LGPLv3 open source at http://www.molgenis.org.",

Approximately 250 information and materials packets were distributed to hospitals that had inquired about the project. Monthly data on pharmacy expenses, personnel use, and productivity were collected for a six-month period by participating hospitals. This information was processed quarterly and converted into the HPMIS indicators; results were categorized according to hospital characteristics and locations. A questionnaire soliciting opinions about the system was sent to participants at the end of the data-collection period. One hundred six hospitals agreed to participate; 84 hospitals submitted data for at least one quarterly period. The range of values for most indicators varied 100-fold; this was attributed to misinterpretation of data item definitions. Based on indicator values, drug and personnel expenses and supportive-personnel use were greater in unit dose hospitals than in hospitals without total unit dose drug distribution systems. Both drug and fluid costs and the extent of supportive-personnel use increased with increasing hospital size. Data-collection time was less in hospitals with computerized pharmacy operations. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that the clinical services indicators were favored the least; however, only a few changes in the data-collection format of the system were suggested. HPMIS appears to be a useful work-measurement tool but needs to be simplified if it to serve as the standard for these systems.",

    "abstract": "In order to facilitate public health response and to achieve early control of infectious disease epidemics, an adjustable epidemiologic information system (AEIS) was established in the Taiwan public health network in February 2006. The performance of AEIS for the period 2006 through 2008 was evaluated based on a number of response times (RT) and the public health impact. After implementation of the system, the apparent overall shortened RT was mainly due to the shortening of personnel response time (PRT) and the time needed to draft a new questionnaire that incurred as personnel-system interface (PSI); PRT dropped from a fluctuating range of 9.8 ∼28.8 days in the first four months to <10 days in the following months and remained low till 2008 (0.88±1.52 days). The PSIs for newly emerged infectious diseases were 2.6 and 3.4 person-hours for H5N1 in 2007 and chikungunya in 2008, respectively, a much improvement from 1142.5 person-hours for SARS in 2003. The duration of each rubella epidemic cluster was evaluated as public health impact and showed a shortening trend (p = 0.019) that concurred with the shortening of PRT from 64.8±47.3 to 25.2±38.2 hours per cluster (p<0.0001). The first evaluation of the novel instrument AEIS that had been used to assist Taiwan's multi-level government for infectious diseases control demonstrated that it was well integrated into the existing public health infrastructure. It provided flexible tools and computer algorithms with friendly interface for timely data collection, integration, and analysis; as a result, it shortened RTs, filled in gaps of personnel lacking sufficient experiences, created a more efficient flow of response, and identified asymptomatic/mild cases early to minimize further spreading. With further development, AEIS is anticipated to be useful in the application of other acute public health events needing immediate orchestrated data collection and public health actions.",

    "abstract": "The most important goal of a health information system (HIS) is improvement of quality, effectiveness and efficiency of health services. To achieve this goal, health care systems should be evaluated continuously. The aim of this paper was to study the impacts of HISs in Iran and the methods used for their evaluation. We systematically searched all English and Persian papers evaluating health information systems in Iran that were indexed in SID, Magiran, Iran medex, PubMed and Embase databases until June 2013. A data collection form was designed to extract required data such as types of systems evaluated, evaluation methods and tools. In this study, 53 out of 1103 retrieved articles were selected as relevant and reviewed by the authors. This study indicated that 28 studies used questionnaires to evaluate the system and in 27 studies the study instruments were distributed within a research population. In 26 papers the researchers collected the information by means of interviews, observations, heuristic evaluation and the review of documents and records. The main effects of the evaluated systems in health care settings were improving quality of services, reducing time, increasing accessibility to information, reducing costs and decreasing medical errors. Evaluation of health information systems is central to their development and enhancement, and to understanding their effect on health and health services. Despite numerous evaluation methods available, the reviewed studies used a limited number of methods to evaluate HIS. Additionally, the studies mainly discussed the positive effects of HIS on health care services.",

    "title": "Assessing stability and performance of a digitally enabled supply chain: Retrospective of a pilot in Uttar Pradesh, India.",
    "abstract": "Immunization supply chains in low resource settings do not always reach children with necessary vaccines. Digital information systems can enable real time visibility of inventory and improve vaccine availability. In 2014, a digital, mobile/web-based information system was implemented in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. This retrospective investigates improvements and stabilization of supply chain performance following introduction of the digital information system. All data were collected via the digital information system between March 2014 and September 2015. Data included metadata and transaction logs providing information about users, facilities, and vaccines. Metrics evaluated include adoption (system access, timeliness and completeness), data quality (error rates), and performance (stock availability on immunization session days, replenishment response duration, rate of zero stock events). Stability was defined as the phase in which quality and performance metrics achieved equilibrium rates with minimal volatility. The analysis compared performance across different facilities and vaccines. Adoption appeared sufficiently high from the onset to commence stability measures of data quality and supply chain performance. Data quality stabilized from month 3 onwards, and supply chain performance stabilized from month 13 onwards. For data quality, error rates reduced by two thirds post stabilization. Although vaccine availability remained high throughout the pilot, the three lowest-performing facilities improved from 91.05% pre-stability to 98.70% post-stability (p<0.01; t-test). Average replenishment duration (as a corrective response to stock-out events) decreased 52.3% from 4.93days to 2.35days (p<0.01; t-test). Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine was significantly less likely to be stocked out than any other material. The results suggest that given sufficient adoption, stability is sequentially achieved, beginning with data quality, and then performance. Identifying when a pilot stabilizes can enable more predictable, reliable cost estimates, and outcome forecasts in the scale-up phase.",

    "title": "Cerner Millennium: the Innsbruck experience.",
    "abstract": "A Clinical Information System, serving more than 2,000 users was to be implemented at three hospitals of TILAK (Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten GmbH), including the University Hospital of Innsbruck. The system was intended to integrate data from radiology, laboratory, and pathology subsystems with patient data. Using Cerner Millennium software and Health Level 7 standards, the first stage of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) was built. Direct data entry was facilitated using either a Microsoft Word text processor (with subsequent authentication workflow) or structured forms. An enterprise-wide scheduling module allows coordination and storage of patient appointments directly in the EPR. As required by security policy, the Cerner software regulates the varying degrees of information exchange among organizations and departments within the enterprise. First experiences indicate satisfactory acceptance of system functionalities. The introduction of Cerner Millennium at TILAK has achieved essential goals defined at the beginning of the project. Basic functionalities--free text documentation, standardized documentation, scheduling, and some parts of order entry--are offered in a user friendly manner. Integration with existing systems to complete the EPR has been successful using standard interfaces (HL7). TILAK concluded that it was possible to successfully implement a Clinical Information System (CIS) developed mainly for the American market in a European healthcare environment. Some adaptations and functional extensions were necessary (e.g., the discharge summary \"Arztbrief\"). The system had enough flexibility to meet the requirements and specifications of European healthcare processes. A key factor of success was the establishment of a basic level of understanding and communication between the software vendor and the TILAK user community.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) increased over the past 2 decades and is estimated to be 3 to 13 per 100,000. The impact of rising AP incidence on health care costs is unknown. Our aim was to examine pediatric AP admissions and associated hospital costs in the United States between years 2004 and 2014. Acute pancreatitis admission and cost data were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System. We determined AP admission and cost percentages each year, as well as the ratio of AP cost to admission percentages to estimate AP \"burden.\" Length of stay, costs of hospitalization, and the effect of intensive care unit care on these estimates were examined. Between 2004 and 2014, AP admission percentages increased (P = 0.002). Length of stay decreased over time (P < 0.0001) and was longer for those requiring intensive care unit care (P < 0.0001). Acute pancreatitis admissions cost per day significantly increased over time (P < 0.0001). Median AP cost percentage remained 1.2 to 1.7 times higher than AP admission percentage. Acute pancreatitis admissions constitute an expensive burden on the health care system relative to the percentage of all admissions. If AP admissions continue to increase, the cost of AP admissions may pose a substantial financial health care burden.",

    "title": "Integrating a health IC card system into a hospital information system.",
    "abstract": "As an experiment, a health IC card has been linked into the hospital information system of the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) Hospital. The NCKU Hospital Information System (NCKU-HIS) services all the procedures for patient registration, billing, prescriptions, and the processing and storing of test results. The health IC card system provides good quality information to the doctors, the hospital, the patients, and the insurance organizations. For a fully comprehensive system, it is essential to integrate the health IC card system into the operational NCKU-HIS, the communication protocols, and the national insurance procedures. The experiment was designed to see if the development of such a system was feasible, and the results have been impressive. It has proved possible to operate the health IC card system, linking into different machines under different computing environments. A single computer system to store all the data of all the patients and to process all the nation's healthcare information would require almost unlimited mainframe processing power and unlimited storage. It would be very difficult to construct such a large computerized information system. All the hospitals would be required to use the same data format to process their information, and a large national healthcare network would have to be built, making the collection and storage of personal medical information very difficult and probably inefficient and unsatisfactory. Even if it was possible, it would be a very costly and time-consuming task. An IC card is cheap and easy to use, and offers an alternative solution to the problem of handling the nation's healthcare information. The original healthcare IC card experiment (started in 1990) was limited to the NCKU Hospital and the Taiwan Government Employees' Clinic. The experimental system was designed to be fully integrated into the NCKU-HIS and has been widely accepted by the users, especially the IC card-holding patients. It is also well-suited to the management of healthcare insurance. An expanded healthcare IC card system was implemented from the end of 1993 and covers six clinics and six hospitals in Penghu County. The operation of the registration and billing subsystems are supported by PC workstations in a client/server network as these subsystems are used very frequently. Some of the other computerized functions in the NCKU-HIS are supported by the mainframe TANDEM computer system. The interfaces with the communication protocols and application software provide for the effective two-way transfer of data and programs. For future use, consideration is being given to the employment of the Health Level Seven (HL/7) protocol for electronic data interchange. National standards such as Chinese information processing, the use of standard codes, the authorization of the content of the IC card, and communication protocols are already incorporated in the system.",

Besides a conventional relational database the medical data warehouse i2b2 serves as main frontend for end-users. The system we developed is suitable to support patient recruitment, cohort identification and quality assurance in daily routine.",

An EDB-based medical registration system for the Norwegian continental shelf (MICS) has been planned in support of health services, health authorities and researchers. This information system will consist of an injury/disease register and a register of the population on the Norwegian continental shelf. The injury/disease register will comprise inter alia reported cases of occupational injury, occupational disease, notifiable infectious disease and summary data about rate of utilisation of ambulance transport and health services offshore. The system will be administered by the Norwegian Directorate of Health in cooperation with the Norwegian Oil Directorate. MICS will provide new possibilities for epidemiological studies of health and disease among the employees in the oil industry.",

A geographic information system (GIS) was used to spatially locate outpatient SUD treatment programs, calculate areas, and determine population density within specific areas. Urban areas were mapped using data from the US Census (2000). Addresses of outpatient SUD treatment programs were obtained from the Facility Locator Web site of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. A 15-mile service catchment around each outpatient SUD treatment program was drawn. The amount of urban area not covered by the service catchment represents the underserved. Total underserved urban area and population without access was computed for each state. Significant variability of underserved urban area and population was observed across the states. Moderate correlations among area and population suggest that some states are more effective in locating SUD treatment programs than other states.",

After reviewing some concepts and principles for effective data management, Hanson clearly applies the concepts to nurse staffing systems, which manage human resources. He defines a seven-step process for establishing an MIS, from defining the management objective to implementing the system. Pointing out that an MIS need not be computerized to be effective, Hanson presents a positive perspective and clarifies some often-misconceived notions about management information systems and the paper printouts they generate. In the next issue of JONA, a second article by Hanson will take a more detailed look at the variety, use, and usefulness of staffing statistics available from an MIS for staffing. These articles are based on material in a forthcoming book, Management Systems for Nursing Service Staffing, to be published by Aspen Systems Corporation, Rockville, Maryland.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable control of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is jeopardized by dwindling public health resources resulting from competing health priorities that include an overwhelming acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. In Mpumalanga province, South Africa, rational planning has historically been hampered by a case surveillance system for malaria that only provided estimates of risk at the magisterial district level (a subdivision of a province). To better map control programme activities to their geographical location, the malaria notification system was overhauled and a geographical information system implemented. The introduction of a simplified notification form used only for malaria and a carefully monitored notification system provided the good quality data necessary to support an effective geographical information system. The geographical information system displays data on malaria cases at a village or town level and has proved valuable in stratifying malaria risk within those magisterial districts at highest risk, Barberton and Nkomazi. The conspicuous west-to-east gradient, in which the risk rises sharply towards the Mozambican border (relative risk = 4.12, 95% confidence interval = 3.88-4.46 when the malaria risk within 5 km of the border was compared with the remaining areas in these two districts), allowed development of a targeted approach to control. The geographical information system for malaria was enormously valuable in enabling malaria risk at town and village level to be shown. Matching malaria control measures to specific strata of endemic malaria has provided the opportunity for more efficient malaria control in Mpumalanga province.",

In this paper, we present our experiences in developing the Clinical Information Integration System (CIIS) for NBK. The system automatically extracts clinical data from hospital information systems as much as possible to avoid errors from manual entry by human errors. It maintains the independence of individual hospitals by employing a two-layer approach, one of which takes care of all hospital-specific aspects. Interoperability is achieved by adopting HL7 v2.x messaging between the biobank and hospitals. We report the current status of the biobank and system deployments.

The SWOG uses its RDBMS as a platform on which to build data operations software. This data operations software, which is written in a compiled computer language, allows multiple users to simultaneously update the database and is interactive with respect to the detection of conditions requiring action and the presentation of options for dealing with those conditions.

    "title": "Evaluating the agreement of users with usability problems identified by heuristic evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Heuristic evaluation (HE) is an inspection method that can be used for identifying usability problems of health information systems. There is insufficient evidence to what extent these problems are experienced by users in their working environment. The objective of this study was to investigate the agreement of real end users of a health information system with the problems identified by HE. First, the emergency information system of educational hospitals in Kerman, Iran was evaluated by a heuristic evaluation. Then, a valid and reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95) electronic questionnaire was designed based on the results of the first phase. Among 127 identified problems, the highest number of problems was related to the \"consistency and standards\" heuristic (18.9%). The user agreement coefficient with heuristic results was 0.5. The highest agreement of the participants was on the problems related to the \"help user recognize, diagnose and recover from errors\" heuristic (78%). There was a significant relationship between participants age and work experience with a computer (p < 0.05). The agreement rate of real end users with the results of HE was at a medium level. Therefore, in some areas, the perception of evaluators in using this method is not consistent with the users experience with a system. This can result in identifying minor issues and ignoring important system-critical usability issues. The HE is appropriate for identifying specific problems, such as problems related to identifying and correcting errors, but in some areas, such as consistency and standards in the design of a system, it identifies minor or ineffective problems.",

By enabling users outside a closed network access to a central database, they permit greater flexibility than traditional 'client-server' systems. Accordingly, web-enabled databases introduce a new tool for epidemiologists, permitting direct data capture at source and thus avoiding many of the delays and errors arising from paper forms and manual data entry. In addition, real-time data collection permits sophisticated decision support and reporting, and thus improved project co-ordination and participation. Nevertheless, the technology is complex and the development of a web-application requires an attention to information technology project management equal to that of the scientific trial or investigation. The potential and problems of web database applications are illustrated by a bespoke system ('PathMan') developed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency of the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to manage a large multi-site study investigating the pathogenesis of bovine tuberculosis in England and Wales.",

    "abstract": "There are differences of opinion regarding the selection of the most practical usability evaluation method among different methods. The present study aimed to compare two expert-based evaluation methods in order to assess a nursing module as the most widely used module of a Hospital Information System (HIS). Five independent evaluators used the Heuristic Evaluation (HE) and Cognitive Walkthrough (CW) methods to evaluate the nursing module of Shafa HIS. In this regard, the number and severity of the recognized problems according to the usability attributes were compared using two evaluation methods. The HE and CW evaluation methods resulted in the identification of 104 and 24 unique problems, respectively, of which 33.3% of recognized problems in the CW evaluation method overlapped with the HE method. The average severity of the recognized problems was considered to be minor (2.34) in the HE method and major (2.77) in the CW evaluation method. There was a significant difference in terms of the total number and average severity of the recognized problems by these methods (P < 0.001). Based on the usability attribute, the HE method identified a larger number of problems concerning all usability attributes, and a significant difference was observed in terms of the number of recognized problems in both methods for all attributes except 'memorability'. Also, there was a significant difference between the two methods based on the average severity of recognized problems only in terms of 'learnability'. The HE method identified more problems with lower average severity while the CW was able to recognize fewer problems with higher average severity. Regarding the evaluation goal, the HE method was able to be used to improve the effectiveness and satisfaction of the HIS. Furthermore, the CW evaluation method is recommended to identify usability problems with the highest average severity, especially in terms of 'learnability'.",

    "title": "An Abstraction Layer to Facilitate Technical Interoperability Between Medical Records and Knowledge Modules.",
    "abstract": "Integrating clinical decision support (CDS) functions into an existing hospital information system (HIS) is often a tedious task. This problem area is so pervasive that the Arden Syntax, a widely used standard for CDS functions, assigned a specific designation, the so-called \"curly braces problem\". It derives from a pair of curly braces used to encapsulate any parameters required for the interactions with a HIS. The traditional approach is to leave the problem area of technical interoperability entirely to the specific institution, possibly entailing a considerable amount of initial programming work. This study describes a reusable and expandable solution to this problem in the form of an abstraction layer. Our study comprised an analytical phase in which we investigated the data source access capabilities of five Arden Syntax environments. Building on the results, we implemented a working prototype that is capable of querying heterogeneous data sources, which facilitates a straightforward connection of new data sources with existing and future communication protocols and standards. From our point of view, the technical aspects of the \"curly braces problem\" with respect to data source access have changed over the years, insofar as technical progress lead to defacto standards for data storage, data querying and inter-system communication. An agreement on such a convention, together with the supply of commonly used data source adapters could promote the further dissemination of the Arden Syntax as a standard for representing and sharing medical knowledge.",

The hospital, through its steering committee, must manage this process, initiating change instead of responding to it. Only then will the implementation of information systems be an orderly process and the impact of these changes on the hospital's organization clearly controlled. The probability of success in implementing new systems would likely be increased if attention centers on gaining commitment to the project, gaining commitment to any changes necessitated by the new system, and assuring that the project is well defined and plans clearly specified. These issues, if monitored throughout the systems implementation, will lead to early identification of potential problems and probable failures. This highly increases the chance of success. A probably failure, once identified, can be given specific attention to assure that associated problems are successfully resolved. The cost of this special attention, monitoring and managing systems implementation, is almost always much less than the cost of the eventual implementation failure.",

    "abstract": "A good notification system is one of the key elements for the success of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs). The national health information system (NHIS) in low income countries is often weak and unreliable. When restructuring this system, what circuit should be used to integrate TB data: the NTP or the NHIS? Experience from several countries shows that unlike the NHIS, only the data generated by the NTP are reliable and complete, and arrive rapidly enough to be used for programme management. It is therefore the duty of the NTP to collect this information and transmit it to the NHIS at each level of the health system. These were the conclusions of a seminar held in Cotonou, Benin, organised by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, which involved the leaders of the NHIS and of NTPs of six West African countries.",

    "title": "Quantifying geocode location error using GIS methods.",
    "abstract": "The Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) collects maternal address information at the time of delivery for infants and fetuses with birth defects. These addresses have been geocoded by two independent agencies: (1) the Georgia Division of Public Health Office of Health Information and Policy (OHIP) and (2) a commercial vendor. Geographic information system (GIS) methods were used to quantify uncertainty in the two sets of geocodes using orthoimagery and tax parcel datasets. We sampled 599 infants and fetuses with birth defects delivered during 1994-2002 with maternal residence in either Fulton or Gwinnett County. Tax parcel datasets were obtained from the tax assessor's offices of Fulton and Gwinnett County. High-resolution orthoimagery for these counties was acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey. For each of the 599 addresses we attempted to locate the tax parcel corresponding to the maternal address. If the tax parcel was identified the distance and the angle between the geocode and the residence were calculated. We used simulated data to characterize the impact of geocode location error. In each county 5,000 geocodes were generated and assigned their corresponding Census 2000 tract. Each geocode was then displaced at a random angle by a random distance drawn from the distribution of observed geocode location errors. The census tract of the displaced geocode was determined. We repeated this process 5,000 times and report the percentage of geocodes that resolved into incorrect census tracts. Median location error was less than 100 meters for both OHIP and commercial vendor geocodes; the distribution of angles appeared uniform. Median location error was approximately 35% larger in Gwinnett (a suburban county) relative to Fulton (a county with urban and suburban areas). Location error occasionally caused the simulated geocodes to be displaced into incorrect census tracts; the median percentage of geocodes resolving into incorrect census tracts ranged between 4.5% and 5.3%, depending upon the county and geocoding agency. Geocode location uncertainty can be estimated using tax parcel databases in a GIS. This approach is a viable alternative to global positioning system field validation of geocodes.",

M@TIC is still regarded as an experimental research procedure. Not all that is technically feasible is ethically acceptable. There are many potential risks associated with M@TIC and it is largely considered, and so it is understood by doctors, that any damage to the patient would be the fault of the system, never the responsibility of the doctor.

To examine OFEK's use and impact on quality indicators and medical-service utilisation in CHS primary-care clinics. Examining the frequency of OFEK's use with its own track-log data; comparing 'before' and 'after' quality indicators and service utilisation of experimental versus control clinics. Use of OFEK increased by hundreds of percent between 2005 and 2006, continued rising at a slower rate in 2007 and decreased slightly in 2008. At clinics in catchment areas of hospitals using OFEK extensively, OFEK reduced the number of imaging tests and, to a lesser extent, laboratory testing and improved several quality measures. An examination of all clinics in the catchment areas and in the study revealed a much weaker impact. OFEK's introduction affected a number of outcome measures - some, significantly - in medical and financial terms. Its increased use at additional clinics may exert a stronger impact there, too. The study contributes to the development of measures to examine the impact of such systems, which can be used to assess a broad range of Health Information Technology (HIT) systems.",

    "abstract": "The article assessed the quality of completion of the maternal school variable in Brazilian state capitals and its regional distribution, based on the Brazilian Information System on Live Births (SINASC) with processed data from live birth certificates. A descriptive study was conducted in the time series from 1996 to 2013, with a total de 12,062,064 births, of which 11,442,494 (94.86%) had valid information on the maternal schooling variable. The results were calculated as the number of incomplete results in the variable per 1,000 live births, and the trend was assessed with the Joinpoint software, version 4.3.1. According to regional analysis, the South of Brazil showed a downward trend in incompleteness of maternal schooling throughout the study in all the state capitals of that region. Most of the country's other state capitals also showed improvement in the variable's completeness. However, there were different trends in some state capitals, even with greater incompleteness at the end of the period when compared to the beginning. SINASC proved to be a valuable source of data on mothers and their newborns, besides information on conditions in labor, delivery, and birth in the country. Maternal schooling, considered an important factor for obstetric and neonatal outcomes, is particularly useful for elaborating and evaluating policies and measures in maternal and child health. Thus, to achieve maximum completeness in data on this variable requires joint effort by health professionals and administrators, thereby guaranteeing the data's trustworthiness.",

    "title": "The pros and cons of implementing PACS and speech recognition systems.",
    "abstract": "The installation and implementation of a hospitalwide image management system and a speech recognition dictation system has had a dramatic and positive impact on radiology report turnaround times at Elmhurst Hospital Center, a 543-bed municipal teaching hospital located in New York City's Borough of Queens. The \"lost film\" problem has been eliminated. As a result, the percentage of unreported examinations has dropped from 25% to less than 1%. These performance improvements have significantly benefited the entire medical staff. With the successful implementation of a HL-7 standards-based radiology information system (RIS), a speech recognition dictation system, around-the-clock staffing of Board Certified radiologists, and a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), report turnaround time improved dramatically. Eighty-six percent of all examinations now are reported formally within a 12-hour period compared with a 3% average before implementation of the changes. However, with the use of the PACS and speech recognition technologies, new problems have arisen within the radiology department. These technologies, designed to enhance communications capabilities, also have significantly reduced the amount of clinician/radiologist dialogue. Easy and rapid access to patient images and reports has had a detrimental effect on that face-to-face consultations with clinicians, which were commonplace before PACS, and now have almost completely disappeared. The radiologist/clinician interchanges, which occurred frequently before a final report was dictated, often resulted in better understanding of the clinical problem and, hence, a more meaningful final report. Although a conferencing feature to facilitate communication exists within the PACS, it is not utilized by the clinicians. The dilemma is that as information about patients is made more available to the hospital staff, less information is provided about patients to the radiologists. Although the speech recognition system benefits the hospital, its staff, and the patients served by reducing clinician time awaiting a diagnostic report and reducing clinic and emergency room waiting time by the patients themselves, it does not necessarily benefit the radiologists who use it. Speech recognition dictation systems slow down the individual productivity of the radiologists' dictation process by at least 25%. Radiologists are assuming the role of transcriptionists as well as diagnosticians. Mistakes occur that would not with the use of a traditional dictation system and professional transcriptionists.",

To ensure patients securely access to medicinal services, many authentication schemes have been proposed. Although numerous cryptographic authentication schemes for TMIS have been proposed with the aim to ensure data security, user privacy and authentication, various forms of attacks make these schemes impractical. To design a truly secure and practical authentication scheme for TMIS, a new biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS without sharing the system private key with distributed servers is presented in this work. Our proposed protocol has perfect security features including mutual authentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and resisting various well-known attacks, and these security feathers are confirmed by the BAN logic and heuristic cryptanalysis, respectively. A secure biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS is presented in this work, which has perfect security properties including perfect forward secrecy, supporting user anonymity, etc., and can withstand various attacks such as impersonation attack, off-line password guessing attack, etc.. Considering security is the most important factor for an authentication scheme, so our scheme is more suitable for multi-server TMIS.",

    "abstract": "In 2001, the blood collection agencies of Zhejiang Province adopted a unified information system, but when a blood product was transferred from the collection and processing facility inventory to some other inventories, because of lacking the unique identifying ability between facilities, the numbers might be overlapped. The exchange of blood units between agencies needed change of labels, and it was very complicated. The SARS outbreak in 2003 made this problem more prominent. Therefore, we decided to redevelop a new information system based on ISBT 128 to solve this problem. We registered with ICCBBA and obtained the technical documentation and database. We requested the new product description code from ICCBBA and properly adjusted the incompatibility between ISBT 128 and the national standards. We redesigned the information system and labels and validated some related equipment and the laboratory information system. In May 2005, we completed the development of the new information system based on ISBT 128, and by the end of 2005, all the blood collection agencies of the Zhejiang Province began to use ISBT 128. As a result, the product information in blood collection agencies of Zhejiang Province can be shared, and the exchange of blood products between agencies became safe and rapid. It was highly praised by the nation's Ministry of Health. ISBT 128 was successfully implemented in Zhejiang Province.",

    "abstract": "Many countries' health systems are implementing reforms to improve the functioning and performance of the Health Management Information System (HMIS) to facilitate evidence-based decisions for delivery of accessible and quality health services. However, in some countries such efforts and initiatives have led to a complex HMIS ecosystem characterized by multiple and fragmented sub-systems. We undertook an in-depth analysis of the HMIS ecosystem in Tanzania to inform the ongoing initiatives, by understanding the relationship and power differences among stakeholders, as well as drivers and barriers to HMIS investment and strengthening. This was a qualitative research method incorporating data collection through document review and key informant interviews guided by political economy analytical framework. A total of 17 key informant interviews were conducted between April and May 2022. A thematic content analysis was used during data analysis. Good relationship between the government and stakeholders dealing/supporting HMIS ecosystem was noted as there are technical working groups which brings stakeholders together to discuss and harmonize HMIS activities. The 'need for the data' has been the driving force toward investment in the HMIS ecosystem. The analysis showed that the government is the main stakeholder within the HMIS ecosystem and responsible for identifying the needs for improvement and has the power to approve or reject systems which are not in line with the government priority as stipulated with the HMIS investment roadmap/strategy. Moreover, partners with long relationship are powerful in influencing HMIS investment decision-making compared to those who are recently coming to support. It was further noted shortage of staff with technical competence, inadequate financial resources, and the development of fact that some of the existing systems have not been developed to their full capacity and have hindered the whole systems' integration and interoperability exercise of ensuring integration and interoperability of the systems. A need-based assessment of staff capacity at the sub-national level is equally important to identify available capabilities and the knowledge gap to strengthen the HMIS ecosystem. Strong coordination of the ideas and resources intended to strengthen the HMIS ecosystem would help to reduce fragmentation. In addition, there is a need to mobilize resources within and outside the country to facilitate the integration and interoperability process smoothly.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the medical laboratory system is being widely applied. We describe the medical laboratory system of our Saga Medical School Hospital, including the electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) laser disk data filing systems. The main computer system of FUJITSU M-730/4 (main memory of host computer 13 MB) handles a large amount of data, in the fields of chemistry, hematology, serology, microbiology, blood banking and histology laboratory. All 17 chemistry and hematology automatic analyzers are linked through communication lines to the main computer. The important tasks of this system are data processing, storing of information in the database, data reporting and quality control statistics. This laboratory system is also connected to the total hospital information system of FUJITSU M-760, main memory 48 MB. For pattern recognition, ECG and EEG laser disk data filing systems have been constructed. The main purpose of these filing systems is mass storage of analog data signals in laser disk, computer assisted analysis and data communication. ECG and EEG analog data are converted into digital form by the analog-to-digital converter, and then transmitted over hospital telephone lines to the central computer system for analysis. The computer assisted statements are then sent back to the ECG terminals at the nurse station. As necessary, after the physician reads over the ECG, statements are printed in the final reports. These optical reporting systems are also linked to the total hospital information system. One of the main tasks in the laboratory is the control of the seemingly endless paper work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Poor quality routine data contributes to poor decision-making, inefficient resource allocation, loss of confidence in the health system, and may threaten the validity of impact evaluations. For several reasons in most developing countries, the routine health information systems in those countries are described as ineffective. Hence, the aim of this study is to determine the quality of data and associated factors in the routine health management information system in health centers of Shashogo district, Hadiya Zone. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1, 2021, to July 1, 2021, and 300 participants were involved in the study through simple random sampling. The data was collected with a self-administered questionnaire by trained data collectors. After checking its completeness, the data was entered into EPI data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 25 for statistical analysis. Finally, variables with p < 0.05 during multivariable analysis were considered significant variables. A total of 300(100%) participant were included in the interview and HMIS data quality was 83% in Shashogo district health centers. The data quality in terms of accuracy, completeness, and timeliness was 79%, 86%, and 84%, respectively. Conducting supportive supervision [AOR 3.5 (1.4, 8.9)], checking accuracy [AOR 1.3 (1.5, 3.5)], filling registrations [AOR 2.7 (1.44, 7.7)], and confidence level [AOR 1.9 (1.55, 3.35)] were all rated positively found to be factors associated with data quality. The overall level of data quality in Shashogo district health centers was found to be below the national expectation level. All dimensions of data quality in the district were below 90% in data accuracy, content completeness, and timeliness of data. Conducting supportive supervision, checking accuracy, filling registrations and confidence level were found to be factors associated with data quality. Hence, all stakeholders should give all necessary support to improve data quality in routine health information systems to truly attain the goal of providing good quality data for the decision-making process by considering the identified factors.",

    "title": "How habit affects continuous use: evidence from Jordan's national health information system.",
    "abstract": "Implementing a health information system (HIS) to enhance healthcare services and patients' experience has become a growing trend in developing countries. Yet little is known about acquainted users' attitudes on continuing the use of an HIS after adoption. Healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses in particular) are reluctant to use HISs because they perceive them as an interruption of their interaction with patients, thus negatively influencing their efficiency. In this study, we extend the technology acceptance model (TAM) by integrating habit as an exogenous variable that affects HISs' perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) to investigate experienced healthcare professionals' attitudes in continuing to use an HIS. The setting of this study is a developing country (Jordan) that implemented a nationwide HIS named Hakeem. The findings show that in the context of healthcare, attitude is the major determinant to continue using HISs. Findings also show that habit significantly increases healthcare professionals' perception of PU and PEOU, which improves their attitudes toward continuing to use HISs. These findings have implications for both research and practice.",

    "title": "Information support for health information management in regional Sri Lanka: health managers' perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Good management, supported by accurate, timely and reliable health information, is vital for increasing the effectiveness of Health Information Systems (HIS). When it comes to managing the under-resourced health systems of developing countries, information-based decision making is particularly important. This paper reports findings of a self-report survey that investigated perceptions of local health managers (HMs) of their own regional HIS in Sri Lanka. Data were collected through a validated, pre-tested postal questionnaire, and distributed among a selected group of HMs to elicit their perceptions of the current HIS in relation to information generation, acquisition and use, required reforms to the information system and application of information and communication technology (ICT). Results based on descriptive statistics indicated that the regional HIS was poorly organised and in need of reform; that management support for the system was unsatisfactory in terms of relevance, accuracy, timeliness and accessibility; that political pressure and community and donor requests took precedence over vital health information when management decisions were made; and use of ICT was unsatisfactory. HIS strengths included user-friendly paper formats, a centralised planning system and an efficient disease notification system; weaknesses were lack of comprehensiveness, inaccuracy, and lack of a feedback system. Responses of participants indicated that HIS would be improved by adopting an internationally accepted framework and introducing ICT applications. Perceived barriers to such improvements were high initial cost of educating staff to improve computer literacy, introduction of ICTs, and HIS restructure. We concluded that the regional HIS of Central Province, Sri Lanka had failed to provide much-needed information support to HMs. These findings are consistent with similar research in other developing countries and reinforce the need for further research to verify causes of poor performance and to design strategic reforms to improve HIS in regional Sri Lanka.",

    "abstract": "Data management in the life sciences has evolved from simple storage of data to complex information systems providing additional functionalities like analysis and visualization capabilities, demanding the integration of statistical tools. In many cases the used statistical tools are hard-coded within the system. That leads to an expensive integration, substitution, or extension of tools because all changes have to be done in program code. Other systems are using generic solutions for tool integration but adapting them to another system is mostly rather extensive work. This paper shows a way to provide statistical functionality over a statistics web service, which can be easily integrated in any information system and set up using XML configuration files. The statistical functionality is extendable by simply adding the description of a new application to a configuration file. The service architecture as well as the data exchange process between client and service and the adding of analysis applications to the underlying service provider are described. Furthermore a practical example demonstrates the functionality of the service.",

The combined 'across time view' and 'across departments view' generated from the integrated clinical data will enable an evolutionary view of the patient state, both across time and across medical specialties. For this purpose and to permit the communication and exchange of data, a new controlled vocabulary for representing clinical data has been created. The construction of this vocabulary is based on the international ICD classification, already being used in DIOGENE for encoding patient diagnosis and procedures. A new extension of the ICD is proposed for medical information that goes beyond diagnosis and procedures encoding. The building of a common clinical findings dictionary, recording the definition of clinical entities, is based on this newly developed clinical vocabulary. This process is incremental, manual and substantial.",

    "abstract": "The global basis for an information system in oral health was introduced by WHO in 1971. Still very few countries have so far prepared a comprehensive national plan for oral health care of the entire population including an information system for monitoring and evaluation. Therefore it is important to realize that the global goals for oral health in the year 2000 introduced by WHO and FDI include a requirement to establish a national monitoring system for oral health. The WHO has developed a simple \"Pathfinder' survey methodology for production of baseline data for a national plan for oral health care. This methodology has now been successfully applied in a number of countries. As a result the WHO Global Oral Data Bank contains a unique set of data on oral health worldwide. It should be understood, however, that within nations more comprehensive and sophisticated information systems are needed to support the activities related to the global goal of Health for All by the Year 2000. This paper gives a short introduction to the development of national information system for oral health utilizing statistics, records and ad hoc studies. The ultimate goal is to build a continuing surveillance system for oral health status and service organization.",

    "title": "Mining care trajectories using health administrative information systems: the use of state sequence analysis to assess disparities in prenatal care consumption.",
    "abstract": "Pregnant women are a vulnerable population. Although regular follow-ups are recommended during pregnancy, not all pregnant women seek care. This pilot study wanted to assess whether the integration of data from administrative health information systems and socio-economic features allows identifying disparities in prenatal care trajectories. Prenatal care trajectories were extracted from the permanent sample of the French health insurance information system linked to the hospital discharge information system. The records of 2518 women who gave birth without complications in France in 2009 were analyzed. State sequence data analysis was performed to identify homogeneous groups of prenatal care trajectories. Socio-economic data were used to characterize their living environment. We identified three groups of homogeneous prenatal care trajectories: (i) women with relatively high prenatal care consumption (~11%), (ii) women with no prenatal care (~21%), and (iii) women with an intermediate level of prenatal care (~66%). Analysis of the socio-economic data demonstrated the association between disparities in prenatal care trajectories and the women's living environment. Women with relatively high care consumption generally lived in socio-economically privileged areas (better education levels, employment status and housing conditions) compared with women with few or no prenatal care. Although ecological, our approach demonstrates that data from health administrative information systems could be used to describe prenatal care. However, more individual variables and an improvement of the data quality are needed to efficiently monitor the content and timing of prenatal care. Moreover, state sequence analysis, which was used in this context for the first time, proves to be an interesting approach to explore care trajectories. Finally, the integration of heterogeneous sources of data, including contextual information, might help identifying areas that require health promotion actions toward vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.",

    "abstract": "The management of patient-specific information is a challenging task for surgeons and physicians because existing clinical information systems are insufficiently integrated into daily clinical routine and contained information entities are distributed across different proprietary databases. Thus, existing information is hardly usable for further electronic processing, workflow support or clinical studies. A Web-based clinical information system has been developed that automatically imports patient-specific information from different information systems. The system is tailored to the existing workflow for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. In this paper, the clinical assistance functions and a quantitative as well as a qualitative system evaluation are presented. The information system has been deployed at a clinical site and is in use in daily clinical routine. Two evaluation studies show that the information integration, the structured information presentation in the Web browser and the assistance functions improve the physician's workflow. The studies also show that the usage of the new information system does not impair the time physicians need for a process step compared with the usage of the existing information system. Information integration is crucial for efficient workflow support in the clinic. The central access to information within a modern and structured user interface saves valuable time for the physician. The comprehensive database allows an instant usage of the existing information clinical workflow support or the conduction of trial studies.",

    "abstract": "Digital maturity is the extent to which digital technologies are used as enablers to deliver a high-quality health service. Extensive literature exists about how to assess the components of digital maturity, but it has not been used to design a comprehensive framework for evaluation. Consequently, the measurement systems that do exist are limited to evaluating digital programs within one service or care setting, meaning that digital maturity evaluation is not accounting for the needs of patients across their care pathways. The objective of our study was to identify the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity and to create a novel, evidence-based tool for evaluating digital maturity across patient care pathways. We systematically reviewed the literature to find the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity. We searched the PubMed database for all papers relevant to digital maturity evaluation. Papers were selected if they provided insight into how to appraise digital systems within the health service and if they indicated the factors that constitute or facilitate digital maturity. Papers were analyzed to identify methodology for evaluating digital maturity and indicators of digitally mature systems. We then used the resulting information about methodology to design an evaluation framework. Following that, the indicators of digital maturity were extracted and grouped into increasing levels of maturity and operationalized as metrics within the evaluation framework. We identified 28 papers as relevant to evaluating digital maturity, from which we derived 5 themes. The first theme concerned general evaluation methodology for constructing the framework (7 papers). The following 4 themes were the increasing levels of digital maturity: resources and ability (6 papers), usage (7 papers), interoperability (3 papers), and impact (5 papers). The framework includes metrics for each of these levels at each stage of the typical patient care pathway. The framework uses a patient-centric model that departs from traditional service-specific measurements and allows for novel insights into how digital programs benefit patients across the health system.

In this study, a national sample of physicians was asked to determine which of these two record systems best serves the function of audit. The study involves assessment of a sample of 69 matched pairs of patient records drawn from two different ward settings, one of which used the manual POMR, the other, PROMIS. No difference was perceived between the two records with respect to the reliability of information or the analytical reasoning of providers.

CHMC received Board approval, including full funding of the entire PACS project, in October 1998. An aggressive time frame for installation was established, as CHMC's PACS leadership committed to the selection, design, and implementation of PACS and computed radiography (CR) within 18 to 20 months. CHMC selected GE (Milwaukee, WI) as its PACS vendor in July 1999, and began its implementation in November 1999. We will present the four-stage integration process undertaken at CHMC: (1) planning the integration effort, (2) designing the Interface, (3) building the interface, and (4) testing the Interface.",

    "abstract": "Nursing homes (NHs) provide complex care for individuals with comorbidity who rely on multiple medications. Electronic information system (EIS) may reduce errors in drug dispensing and medical administration records (MAR). This paper tests whether the percentage of occupancy and metropolitan location are associated with the likelihood of using EIS for clinical care support. This study is a retrospective secondary analysis of a national survey database, using the facility-level data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey. Multivariate logistic regression is used to model the likelihood of having EIS. The facility characteristic variables include occupancy rates, metropolitan (MSA) status, number of services, census region, accreditation status, ownership, administrator's tenure, and education. Hypothesis 1 is partially supported by the results of the multivariate analysis, while hypothesis 2 is not supported. NHs providing more services are more likely to have EIS for drug dispensing and MAR. Census region, administrator's experience, administrator's educational attainment, and accreditation by independent accreditation organizations also have significant effects. The adoption of EIS for drug dispensing and medication administration in nursing homes is associated with multiple factors. More research is needed to explore and examine the effects of additional factors that facilitate or inhibit the use of EIS for clinical care support in nursing homes.",

This paper demonstrates that local knowledge of flood hazards can be structured systematically into geographic information system (GIS) outputs. When combined with forecasting models and risk scenarios, they strengthen the legitimacy of local knowledge of at-risk populations. This is essential for effective disaster risk reduction practices by external actors, local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and municipal authorities. The research focused on understanding coping strategies and 'manageability' of flood hazards as defined by communities. 'Manageability' is how people experience flooding in relation to their household capacity and the coping mechanisms available. The research in the Philippines highlights the significance of localised factors, including socioeconomic resources, livelihoods, seasonality and periodicity, for understanding manageability. The manageability concept improves practice at the municipal level by legitimising local coping strategies, providing better indicators, and developing understanding of flooding as a recurrent threat.",

Studies show a potential moderating effect of mental workload on predictors of technology acceptance. Aim of this study was the investigation of predictors of technology acceptance (UTAUT) related to clinical information systems and their relation to mental workload. This quasi-experimental study with 48 participants used the following measures: NASA TLX and UTAUT questionnaire. Participants had to perform three tasks on a clinical information system as well as four task-levels of the n-back task with increasing difficulty. Analyses show a high level of technology acceptance (M=3.82, SD=.76) and confirm performance expectancy as the most relevant predictor of behavioral intention (β=.48, p<.001). A linear regression showed that a high level of mental workload has an influence on performance expectancy (F1,46=8.438, p<.05). The study shows an influence of mental workload on acceptance, the strength and role of which (e.g. moderation) needs to be further investigated, especially in the context of other determinants.",

Algorithms are used to analyze growth parameters over serial examinations, plot growth curves, generate a radiologic report, and provide instantaneous diagnostic assistance and suggestions. A bibliographic data-base system containing more than 3000 references (with abstracts) in the obstetric sonographic literature is integrated with the software's analytical functions. A telecommunications software module performs dialogues, such as immediate automatic transcription of the sonographic report, with the radiology information system. An examination summary form, growth curves, and the radiologist's report can be printed or digitally faxed by the workstation after authorization by the radiologist. The workstation has improved the organization of sonographic data, facilitated serial quantitative analysis, supplemented educational resources for our staff radiologists and residents, reduced transcription errors and transcription delays, and shortened to minutes the time necessary to deliver precise examination results to clinicians. This model is suitable for use in many areas in a radiology department.",

The consortium proposes four categories of clinical system risks and four classes of measured monitoring and regulatory actions that can be applied strategically based on the level of risk in a given setting. The consortium recommends local oversight of clinical software systems, and adoption by healthcare information system developers of a code of good business practices. Budgetary and other constraints limit the type and number of systems that the FDA can regulate effectively. FDA regulation should exempt most clinical software systems and focus on those systems posing highest clinical risk, with limited opportunities for competent human intervention.",

This project aims at the implementation of the first total hospital information system by seamlessly integrating these systems together. To achieve this goal, we took three-tiered systems integration approach: network level, database level, and workstation level integration. There are 3 loops of networks in SNUH: proprietary star network for host computer based HIS, Ethernet based hospital LAN for OCS and RIS, and ATM based network for PACS. They are linked together at the backbone level to allow high speed communication between these systems. We have developed special communication modules for each system that allow data interchange between different databases and computer platforms. We have also developed an integrated workstation in which both the OCS and PACS application programs run on a single computer in an integrated manner allowing the clinical users to access and display radiological images as well as textual clinical information within a single user environment. A study is in progress toward a total hospital information system in SNUH by seamlessly integrating the main hospital information resources such as HIS, OCS, and PACS. With the three-tiered systems integration approach, we could successfully integrate the systems from the network level to the user application level.",

In recent years, all kinds of network attacks emerge in an endless stream, and the losses are immeasurable. Therefore, the protection of information system security is a problem that needs to be paid attention to in the new situation. The existing BP neural network algorithm is improved as the core algorithm of the security intelligent evaluation of the rating information system. The input nodes are optimized. In the risk factor identification stage, most redundant information is filtered out and the core factors are extracted. In the risk establishment stage, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the initial network parameters of BP neural network algorithm to overcome the dependence of the network on the initial threshold, At the same time, the performance of the improved algorithm is verified by simulation experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional BP algorithm, PSO-BP algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher accuracy in risk value prediction. The error value of PSO-BP evaluation method is almost zero, and there is no error fluctuation in 100 sample tests. The maximum error value is only 0.34 and the average error value is 0.21, which proves that PSO-BP algorithm has excellent performance.",

Our results show that respondents use computers frequently, primarily to perform academic-oriented tasks as opposed to clinical tasks. Overall, respondents viewed computers as being slightly beneficial to health care. They perceive self-education and access to up-to-date information as the most beneficial aspects of computers and are most concerned about privacy issues and the effect of computers on the doctor-patient relationship. Physicians with prior computer training and greater knowledge of informatics concepts had more favorable attitudes towards computers in health care.

    "abstract": "A sentinel health information system using a telematics system to collect epidemiological data from a network of general practitioners (GPs) making up 5% of the GP population was set up in October 1986 in Aquitaine, France. In the first year, four topics were under surveillance. The GPs reported data for each case diagnosed by filling out a questionnaire displayed on their home terminal (Minitel), which transmitted the data by standard telephone lines to a central minicomputer located in the Bordeaux University Medical Centre. Regular feedback was provided to the participating GPs, public health officials and the Bordeaux Medical School. A detailed report of GP participation is presented, the reliability of our findings is discussed in terms of the motivational factors of participants, and the usefulness of the system is evaluated both for immediate teaching implications and for future research possibilities.",

    "abstract": "This study shows the evolution of a biomedical observation dictionary within the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux Paris (AP-HP), the largest European university hospital group. The different steps are detailed as follows: the dictionary creation, the mapping to logical observation identifier names and codes (LOINC), the integration into a multiterminological management platform and, finally, the implementation in the health information system. AP-HP decided to create a biomedical observation dictionary named AnaBio, to map it to LOINC and to maintain the mapping. A management platform based on methods used for knowledge engineering has been put in place. It aims at integrating AnaBio within the health information system and improving both the quality and stability of the dictionary. This new management platform is now active in AP-HP. The AnaBio dictionary is shared by 120 laboratories and currently includes 50 000 codes. The mapping implementation to LOINC reaches 40% of the AnaBio entries and uses 26% of LOINC records. The results of our work validate the choice made to develop a local dictionary aligned with LOINC. This work constitutes a first step towards a wider use of the platform. The next step will support the entire biomedical production chain, from the clinician prescription, through laboratory tests tracking in the laboratory information system to the communication of results and the use for decision support and biomedical research. In addition, the increase in the mapping implementation to LOINC ensures the interoperability allowing communication with other international health institutions.",

This study aimed to determine the utilisation of HMIS data and factors influencing the health system's performance at the district and primary health care facility levels in Tanzania. This cross-sectional study was carried out in 11 districts and involved 115 health care facilities in Tanzania. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to health workers at facility and district levels and documented using an observational checklist. Thematic content analysis approach was used to synthesise and triangulate the responses and observations to extract essential information. A total of 93 healthcare facility workers and 13 district officials were interviewed. About two-thirds (60%) of the facility respondents reported using the HMIS data, while only five out of 13 district respondents (38.5%) reported analysing HMIS data routinely. The HMIS data were mainly used for comparing performance in terms of services coverage (53%), monitoring of disease trends over time (50%), and providing evidence for community health education and promotion programmes (55%). The majority (41.4%) of the facility's personnel had not received any training on data management related to HMIS during the past 12 months prior to the survey. Less than half (42%) of the health facilities had received supervisory visits from the district office 3 months before this assessment. Nine district respondents (69.2%) reported systematically receiving feedback on the quality of their reports monthly and quarterly from higher authorities. Patient load was described to affect staff performance on data collection and management frequently. Inadequate analysis and poor data utilisation practices were common in most districts and health facilities in Tanzania. Inadequate human and financial resources, lack of incentives and supervision, and lack of standard operating procedures on data management were the significant challenges affecting the HMIS performance in Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "In each clinical case, the equipment display dose is used for interventional radiology (IVR) dose management and conform to the Japan diagnostic reference levels 2020 (DRLs 2020). However, dose management software corresponding to the DRLs 2020 using radiation dose structured report (RDSR) is not sufficiently widespread. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of in-house developed dose management software in IVR utilizing radiology information system (RIS), which can record both procedures and lesions. In this study, IVR from July to September 2020 was analyzed (cardiac regions: 141 cases and other regions: 149 cases). The evaluation items were air kerma-area product, air kerma at the patient entrance reference point, and patient information (height, weight, and BMI). Each subject of DRLs 2020 was analyzed by 12 radiological technologists in charge of IVR. The difference between results of the manual analysis and those of the in-house developed dose management software was calculated using paired t-test in terms of analysis time. The analysis time for the cardiac and other regions was 4180.25±1161.79 s and 4366.92±1393.19 s in the manual analysis, and 36.25±15.32 s and 38.08±17.34 s in the software. The use of software indicated a significant reduction in analysis time (p<0.05). The analysis accuracy of the cardiac and other regions was 96.30% and 98.89% in the software. These results show the usefulness of dose management software utilizing RIS.",

The aim of this study was to examine drivers' acceptability of Co-Drive by investigating the impact of traffic information provided via on-board display devices on motorists' beliefs and behaviour. 116 drivers (Men=46.6%), between 22 and 62 years, participated to a driving simulator experiment. They were randomly divided into two experimental groups according to the type of display device (Blackberry vs. iPhone) and a control group. The experimental groups were exposed to fourteen on-board traffic messages: warning (e.g., road crash), recommendation (e.g., the use of seat-belt) and comfort messages (e.g., the location of a gas station). They had to validate each message by pushing the headlight flashing button as soon as they understood it. At the end, all participants had to fill in a questionnaire. Drivers evaluated positively the on-board messages, expressed a high level of confidence in the on-board information and estimated having received it sufficiently in advance for them to adjust their behaviour. Regardless of the type of display device, they took more time to read warning and recommendation messages as compared to comfort messages and complied with them. Finally, those exposed to the messages adapted their behaviour easier to the road events than those who did not receive them. Practical implications of the results are discussed.",

To create clinical computing tools that are useful to and used by clinicians, developers of clinical information systems must have accurate models of the users for whom their systems are intended. To create these models, the information needs of clinicians must be understood. While the wireless handheld environment offers many advantages such as the ability to provide mobile access to information, there are a number of challenges. Developing for this environment differs from the laptop and desktop environments due to features such as processing power, screen size, input mechanism, and bandwidth. PalmCIS (Palm-based Clinical Information System) is a clinical application being developed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) that provides clinicians with access to patient data via a wireless handheld device. We are using an automated technique to uncover patient-specific information needs of clinicians while using a patient record system. With the results, we can enhance PalmCIS.",

Transfer station (TS) being a link between various waste management (WM) facilities plays a significant role in collection and transportation of waste. Thus, locating TS at suitable site can help in reducing the overall impacts. Employment of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis tools in CDWM is a powerful strategy for site suitability study. A case study in Coimbatore, India, is presented in this study using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis for locating C&D waste TS. The criteria for site suitability analysis are chosen based on literature review, regulations, and experts' opinions. Weights of the chosen criteria are estimated using analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the final suitability map is created by weighted overlay analysis (WOA) in GIS environment. Results provide first-hand information for local decision makers to locate C&D waste transfer station in the chosen study region and report that 12% of the entire area is \"highly suitable\" for transfer station location.",

    "abstract": "A CDC program goal for 2010 is to achieve >95% participation in an immunization information system (IIS) (defined as having two or more recorded vaccinations) among children aged <6 years. IISs, previously known as immunization registries, are confidential, computerized information systems that collect and consolidate vaccination data from multiple health-care providers, generate reminder and recall notifications, and assess vaccination coverage within a defined geographic area. Most IISs have additional capabilities, such as vaccine management, adverse event reporting, maintenance of birth-to-death vaccination histories, and interoperability with other health information systems. IISs can provide accurate data on which to make informed vaccination decisions and better protect against vaccine-preventable diseases. This report highlights selected data from CDC's 2006 Immunization Information System Annual Report (IISAR), a survey of grantees in 50 states, five cities, and the District of Columbia that receive funding under the Public Health Service Act. The data indicated that 65% of all U.S. children aged <6 years (approximately 15 million children) participated in an IIS in 2006, an increase from 56% in 2005. The majority of grantees (70%) reported that their IISs have the capacity to track vaccinations for persons of all ages. Data on vaccinations were entered within 30 days of vaccine administration for 69% of children aged <6 years. However, results for certain data completeness measures were low. These findings underscore the need to continue to address challenges to full IIS participation and ensure high-quality information.",

    "abstract": "Geographic information system (GIS) plays an important role in identifying areas with a high incidence of cancer. In the present study, based on a systematic review of studies by Iranian researchers, we performed a scientometric analysis of the published articles on the spatial epidemiology of cancer. In addition, the geographical distribution of certain types of cancer in Iran is presented. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and NLM Gateway, Institute for Scientific Information, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from 2000 to 2021. The search was performed using a combination of medical subject heading terms and keywords. A narrative synthesis was performed, and descriptive data were expressed as frequency and percentage. Of the 200 identified articles, 31 studies published in 15 different journals were included in this systematic review. Results showed a wide variation in high-risk breast cancer clusters. However, a similar incidence of gastrointestinal cancers has been reported, and high-risk clusters were identified in the north and the northwest of Iran. Skin cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were more prevalent in the central provinces. The current volume of studies on the spatial epidemiology of cancer in Iran, with a CiteScore quartile of Q1, is inadequate to guide health policymakers. The geographical distribution of many prevalent types of cancer has not been assessed by Iranian researchers. Furthermore, the classification of high- and low-risk geographical clusters of cancers was not completely homogeneous.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacy information system is one of the central pillars of a hospital information system. This research evaluated a pharmacy information system according to six aspects of the medication process in three hospitals in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. System administrators were interviewed to determine availability of functionalities. Then, system users within the hospital were targeted to evaluate their level of usage of these functionalities. The study was cross-sectional. Two structured surveys were designed. The overall response rate of hospital users was 31.7 percent. In all three hospitals studied, the electronic health record is hybrid, implementation has been completed and the system is running, and the systems have computerized provider order entry and clinical decision support. Also, the pharmacy information systems are integrated with the electronic health record, and computerized provider order entry and almost all prescribing and transcription functionalities are available; however, drug dispensing is a mostly manual process. However, the study hospitals do not use barcode-assisted medication administration systems to verify patient identity and electronically check dose administration, and none of them have computerized adverse drug event monitoring that uses the electronic health record. The numbers of users who used different functionalities most or all of the time was generally low. The highest frequency of utilization was for patient administration records (56.8 percent), and the lowest was for linkage of the pharmacy information system to pharmacy stock (9.1 percent). Encouraging users to use different functionalities was highly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHD) are common and are a frequent subject of research using large administrative databases such as the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database. The capture rate of CHD within PHIS, however, has not been described. The PHIS database includes inpatient encounters from over 52 tertiary care pediatric hospitals across the United States. We identified all patients less than 1 year of age with a cardiac defect in PHIS from 2010 to 2014 and compared these results with national prevalence estimates based on the National Birth Defects Prevention Network annual report, which served as the gold standard. The capture rate of CHD in PHIS ranged from 30 to 95% depending on the spectrum of severity and heterogeneity of the cardiac defect. The capture rate was higher for critical CHD (CCHD) at 66%, and all lesions with 70% or greater capture rate (interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, double outlet right ventricle, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome) fell within the CCHD category. Just over half of the predicted CHD patients were identified using the PHIS database. Although there is a high capture rate for CHD that require early hospitalization, there is a low capture rate for defects with a wider spectrum of disease presentation. These attributes of the PHIS database should be used to frame previous and future research using PHIS to study CHD.",

    "title": "An Information System for Brownfield Regeneration: providing customised information according to stakeholders' characteristics and needs.",
    "abstract": "In the EU brownfield presence is still considered a widespread problem. Even though, in the last decades, many research projects and initiatives developed a wealth of methods, guidelines, tools and technologies aimed at supporting brownfield regeneration. However, this variety of products had and still has a limited practical impact on brownfield revitalisation success, because they are not used in their entire potential due to their scarce visibility. Also, another problem that stakeholders face is finding customised information. To overcome this non-visibility and not-sufficient customisation of information, the Information System for Brownfield Regeneration (ISBR) has been developed, based on Artificial Neural Networks, which allows understanding stakeholders' information needs by providing tailored information. The ISBR has been tested by stakeholders from the EU project TIMBRE case studies, located in the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Romania. Data gained during tests allowed to understand stakeholders' information needs. Overall, stakeholders showed to be concerned first on remediation aspects, then on benchmarking information, which are valuable to improve practices in the complex field of brownfield regeneration, and then on the relatively new issue of sustainability applied to brownfield regeneration and remediation. Mature markets confirmed their interest for remediation-related aspects, highlighting the central role that risk assessment plays in the process. Emerging markets showed to seek information and tools for strategic and planning issues, like brownfield inventories and georeferenced data sets. Results led to conclude that a new improved platform, combining the ISBR functionalities with geo-referenced ones, would be useful and could represent a further research application.",

    "title": "Pharmacists' Perceptions of the Benefits and Challenges of Electronic Product Information System Implementation in Hong Kong: Mixed-Method Study.",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of technology, more countries are now adopting the use of electronic product information (ePI), which refer to an electronic version of physical product inserts in a semistructured format optimized for electronic manipulation. The successful implementation of ePI has led to advantages and convenience to patients, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical companies in many regions and countries. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), there is currently no citywide implementation of ePI. The SAR exhibits conditions that would favor the implementation of an ePI system, as well as existing barriers hindering its implementation. However, no study has been performed to examine the specific situation in Hong Kong. The objective of this study is to explore working pharmacists' overall perception of ePI and to identify potential challenges to the implementation of an ePI system in Hong Kong. This mixed-method study involved a structured survey and interview with practicing pharmacists in Hong Kong. Pharmacists were eligible if they were licensed to practice in Hong Kong, and currently working locally in any pharmacy-related sectors and institutions. Respondents completed a survey to indicate their level of agreement with statements regarding the potential advantages of ePI over paper PI. A structured interview was conducted to gather respondents' perceived advantages of ePI over paper PI in different aspects, such as professionalism, usability, presentation, and environment, as well as challenges of citywide ePI implementation in Hong Kong. Thematic analysis was adopted to analyze the qualitative data. Grounded theory was used to generate themes and identify specific outcomes. A total of 16 pharmacists were recruited, comprising 4 community pharmacists, 5 hospital pharmacists, and 7 industrial pharmacists. All of them used electronic platforms at least once per month on average. Respondents identified many flaws in physical package inserts that can potentially be mitigated using ePI. The speed with which drug information can be retrieved and the degree to which the drug information can be readily updated and disseminated were considered the greatest strengths of ePI. The clarity with which ePI present drug information to patients was considered as the weakest aspect of ePI. Many respondents highlighted concerns about the security risks and high cost associated with system maintenance and that certain subpopulations may not be sufficiently computer literate to navigate the ePI system. Respondents also voiced many concerns about the implementation and maintenance of a local ePI system. We conclude that an ePI system is generally supported by pharmacists but concerns about implementation process and maintenance of the system has been raised. The perceived benefits of ePI gathered from this study, as well as collective evidence from other countries with mature ePI systems, confirm that more efforts should be made to promote optimized development and implementation of an ePI system in Hong Kong.",

    "abstract": "We address the question of how data collected during routine medical practice and stored in a hospital information system to support the various functions of the hospital can be used for clinical epidemiological research. The hospital information system HIS developed by BAZIS and implemented at the Leiden University Hospital is used as an example because the availability of data for clinical research is considered a potential benefit of the BAZIS-HIS. After a brief outline of the research area of clinical epidemiology and the BAZIS-HIS has been given, three different ways in which a hospital information system can be used in clinical epidemiology, are discussed: (1) as a sampling frame to select the study population; (2) to collect data from patients taking part in the study; (3) to register data specifically collected for the study. Whether or not the hospital information system is used in a particular study depends on the specific research question, the design of the study, the content of the database and the completeness and accuracy of the registration. We shall argue that retrieval facilities alone are not sufficient to support clinical research. To decide which items can best be used to select a study population, it is necessary to know how medical events take place in daily practice and how they are registered. Therefore when data stored in hospital information systems are used for epidemiological research, close collaboration is required between the clinical epidemiologists, the hospital administrative personnel and the data processing experts.",

    "abstract": "In changing the context regarding the situation of vulnerable children in rural South Africa, understanding the role of communication in the design of community-based child health information systems (HIS) is key. Communication goes beyond language. The importance of translation of terms and concepts used to negotiate between different meanings and logics is explored in this paper. In striving for the 'ideal speech situation' [J. Habermas, Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1989], or, in other words, creating an enabling environment in which people can participate in debate and discussion on equal terms, there is a need to develop a codetermined vision; to understand local meanings of and for childhood illness; to understand communication systems and the context in which they occur; and to connect with networks beyond the localised setting, such as provincial or national health authorities. We provide a theoretical and practical framework in which important aspects of communication related to IS design can be highlighted and against which the implementation of an IS can be reviewed. The South African case study from the UThukela District Child Survival Project in KwaZulu-Natal, illustrates how this approach was used in co-constructing local meanings for child health indicators in a community-based information system.",

A total of 3610 nurses working in Finland responded. Both descriptive and explanatory statistics were used to analyze the data. The three dependent variables \"nursing documentation,\" \"digital environment,\" and \"ethics and data protection\" were formulated from the data. Nurses' overall informatics competency was good. The \"ethics and data protection\" competency score was higher than that of \"nursing documentation\" or \"digital environment.\" Recently graduated nurses and nurses working in outpatient care, virtual hospital, examination, or operation had highest \"digital environment\" competency score. Health information system experience was associated with \"nursing documentation.\" Nurses are highly qualified health information systems users. However, the competency requirements generated by rapidly expanding digitalization have challenged nurses. It is important to increase educational programs for nurses of how to use digital devices, and how to support patients to use digital services.",

Incomplete records and records that do not integrate pain data will affect patient safety. Use of information technology helps facilitate communication within the medical team and improve quality of care. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pain management information system. The questionnaire survey method was employed in this study. The system-evaluation questionnaire was designed based on the six dimensions of the information system success model (ISSM), including system quality, information quality, service quality, intention to use, user satisfaction, and net benefits. Three months after the pain management system was implemented, the opinions of 282 nurses from a medical center in central Taiwan were collected. Research data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Of the six dimensions, \"information quality\" received the highest average score (4.71). The two dimensions of \"intention to use\" and \"user satisfaction\" had the highest correlation with \"net benefits\". \"User satisfaction\" was found to have the highest predictive power for the \"net benefits\" of the system, with an explanatory power of about 81.2%. The pain management system considered in this study was shown to provide complete and accurate pain management information, which is an important factor affecting nurses' intention to use and satisfaction. The evaluation results based on the ISSM show the pain management system to be a good information system that generates accurate information and has a high intention-to-use rate and high rate of user satisfaction.",

    "title": "Implementation of Health Information Systems to Improve Patient Identification.",
    "abstract": "Wellbeing can be ensured in society through quality healthcare, a minimum of medical errors, and the improved performance of healthcare professionals. To this end, health information systems have been implemented in hospitals, with this implementation representing progress in medicine and information technologies. As a result, life expectancy has significantly increased, standards in healthcare have been raised, and public health has improved. This progress is influenced by the process of managing healthcare organizations and information systems. While hospitals tend to adapt health information systems to reduce errors related to patient misidentification, the rise in the occurrence and recording of medical errors in Lebanon resulting from failures to correctly identify patients reveals that such measures remain insufficient due to unknown factors. This research aimed to investigate the effect of health information systems (HISs) and other factors related to work-related conditions on reductions in patient misidentification and related consequences. The empirical data were collected from 109 employees in Neioumazloum Hospital in Lebanon. The results revealed a correlation between HISs and components and the effects of other factors on patient identification. These other factors included workload, nurse fatigue, a culture of patient safety, and lack of implementation of patient identification policies. This paper provides evidence from a Lebanese hospital and paves the way for further studies aiming to explore the role of information technologies in adopting HISs for work performance and patient satisfaction. Improved care for patients can help achieve health equality, enhance healthcare delivery performance and patient safety, and decrease the numbers of medical errors.",

Open source permits an inexpensive development model where interfaces can be updated as needed, and the code is peer reviewed by many eyes (analogous to the scientific model). Integration of PACS/RIS functionality reduces the risk of inconsistent data by reducing interfaces among databases that contain largely redundant information. Also, wide adoption would promote standard data mining tools--reducing user needs to learn multiple methods to perform the same task. A model has been constructed capable of accepting HL7 orders, performing examination and resource scheduling, providing digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) worklist information to modalities, archiving studies, and supporting DICOM query/retrieve from third party viewing software. The multitiered architecture uses a single database communicating via an ODBC bridge to a Linux server with HL7, DICOM, and HTTP connections. Human interaction is supported via a web browser, whereas automated informatics services communicate over the HL7 and DICOM links. The system is still under development, but the primary database schema is complete as well as key pieces of the web user interface. Additional work is needed on the DICOM/HL7 interface broker and completion of the base DICOM service classes.",

It is divided into: (1) clinical information and epilepsy relevant data; and (2) EEG data, which is hierarchically structured including description and interpretation of EEG. Data is coded but is supplemented with unrestricted text. The resulting patient database can be integrated with other clinical databases and with the patient record system and may facilitate clinical and epidemiological research and development of standards and guidelines for EEG description and interpretation. The system is currently used for teleconsultation between Gentofte and Lisbon.",

A scoping review was conducted to summarize studies that employed GPS and/or GIS to assess community participation. Systematic literature searches were performed using nine electronic databases, up to April 2022. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility and extracted data from the selected studies. The searches retrieved 628 articles, of which 36 met the inclusion criteria. In 31 studies, a GPS unit or GPS-enabled device monitored the community mobility of individuals with different health conditions. Tracking periods varied from five hours to 30 consecutive days. The spatiotemporal parameters obtained from satellite-based data provided information about individuals' presence in the community. Most studies combined GPS with other measuring tools (self-report diaries/questionnaires, qualitative interviews) to capture a broader description of community participation. GPS and GIS are viable approaches for advancing research as they provide unique information about community participation not easily captured by other methods. The combination of available methods comprehensively address the physical and social dimensions of this construct.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONGlobal positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology allows direct and real-time quantification of patterns of individuals' community mobility.The geographic area where individuals participate in daily living activities complements information from self-report diaries/questionnaires.Combining GPS technology with self-report diaries/questionnaires allows a broader description of individuals' community participation, addressing respectively both its physical and social dimensions.Knowledge of individuals' access to and involvement in community locations/situations may help therapists design interventions to improve community participation.",

A postal questionnaire was circulated to every consultant obstetrician in Great Britain at the beginning of 1992. Information was sought on the hardware, software and uses of obstetric computer systems. Satisfaction with, benefits and problems of the system were also assessed. There was an 87.5% response rate. Of the 264 units questioned, 100 units reported that they had a computer system. Sixty-five units used terminals connected to a mainframe or minicomputer and 17 used stand-alone personal computers (PCs). Local area networks (LANs) were used in 19 units and wide area network (WANs) in 22 units. Software varied from commercial turnkey systems to in-house systems. The quoted annual running cost ranged from 50 pounds to 48,000 pounds. Most units were satisfied with their system. Problems included slow operating times, unreliability, user unfriendliness, deficiencies in training and inadequate customer support services. Obstetric computer systems are now coming into widespread use. Despite problems, the use of such systems is likely to increase. This survey establishes a database for those units who are considering acquiring or changing their computer system for the purpose of audit or research.",

    "title": "Improving report turnaround time: an integrated method using data from a radiology information system.",
    "abstract": "In the face of a changing health care system and increased competition, radiology departments need to become more efficient. One measurement of efficiency is promptness in producing a final report. Many large radiology centers have radiology information systems (RIS) that track work flow, collecting tremendous amounts of data. Most, however, lack an appropriate analytic mechanism. We have developed an integrated system that allows continual monitoring of radiology work flow and thus of opportunities to apply interventions. This system can form an important component of the quality management process in the radiology department. In developing the system, we identified seven key steps in the work-flow process. When left to chance, these steps occur out of sequence and large delays occur. A scheme was devised to improve the sequencing of the work flow by using the data collected from the RIS, sorted by radiology division and patient type. Biweekly, the appropriate data file is transferred to each division for analysis, via the department's computer network. A one-step process follows, using desktop Macintosh computers and a custom program written in Microsoft Excel. Extracted data are quickly converted into a tailored division summary, and a report is automatically generated. The result summary format is uniform throughout the department, allowing ease of review at divisional and departmental meetings. Problems can be immediately localized to a specific step in the work-flow process. Automation of much of the system allows continual, near-real-time review of work flow. Using this approach, we have seen a sustained reduction of average report turnaround time. This system allows continual monitoring of work flow. It is largely automated and lends itself well to inclusion in the quality management program of any radiology department.",

    "abstract": "Clinical information systems (CISs) have generated opportunities for meaningful improvements both in patient care and workflow but there is still a long way to perfection. Healthcare providers are still facing challenges of data exchange, management, and integration due to lack of functionality among these systems. Our objective here is to systematically review, synthesize, and summarize the literature that describes the current stage of clinical information systems, so as to assess the current state of knowledge, and identify benefits and challenges. PubMed, EMBASE, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies published until September 1, 2017, which reported on significant advancement of clinical information systems, as well as problems and opportunities in this field. Studies providing the most detailed information were included and the others were kept only as references. We selected 23 papers out of 1,026 unique abstracts for full-text review using our selection criteria, and 20 out of these 23 studies met all of our inclusion criteria. We focused on three major areas: 1) Ambulatory and inpatients clinical information systems; 2) Specialty information systems; and 3) Ancillary information systems. As CIS can support evidence-based practices that, in turn, improve patient's safety, quality and efficacy of care, advancement, acceptability, and adaptability of CIS have increased worldwide. Although, the demand for CIS functionality is rising fast, current CISs still have data integration challenges and lack of functionality to exchange patient information from all or some parts of the healthcare system. These limitations can be attributed to technical, human, and organizational factors Conclusion: Clinical information systems provide tremendous opportunities to reduce clinical errors such as medication errors and diagnostic errors and to support healthcare professionals by offering up-to-date patient information. They promise to improve workflow and efficiency of care, thus boosting the overall quality of healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to improve care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients necessitates collection of accurate, detailed, longitudinal data. We sought to document what electronic health record systems are currently available at ACHD centers and to assess national interest in a uniform ACHD-focused system. Directors of ACHD centers in the United States were invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding current health information systems at their institution both for general cardiology and for ACHD. Topics that were surveyed included utility and perceived limitations of currently available systems. The survey also assessed the level of interest in an ACHD-specific system, and its optimal functions. Thirty-four centers responded, representing both pediatric and adult institutions that care for patients with ACHD. Of these, 80% reported using a variety of commercially supported electronic medical record products, whereas only 50% employed an ACHD-specific noncommercial database to supplement their institutional system. Comparison of the two systems revealed that most clinical activities are pursued through the institutional electronic medical record system. Research and tracking of clinical activities were the primary uses of ACHD-specific systems, which have several noted limitations. Strong interest in an integrated ACHD-specific system was found among responders. There is both an unmet need and a strong interest in an ACHD-oriented electronic health record that could facilitate research, outcome tracking, quality assurance, and inter-institutional collaboration, all functions that are lacking in electronic health systems currently in use.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to assess changes in land use/land cover patterns in the coastal town of Silivri, a part of greater Istanbul administratively. In the assessment, remotely sensed data, in the form of satellite images, and geographic information systems were used. Types of land use/land cover were designated as the percentage of the total area studied. Results calculated from the satellite data for land cover classification were compared successfully with the database Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE). This served as a reference to appraise the reliability of the study presented here. The CORINE Program was established by the European Commission to create a harmonized Geographical Information System on the state of the environment in the European Community. Unplanned urbanization is causing land use changes mainly in developing countries such as Turkey. This situation in Turkey is frequently observed in the city of Istanbul. There are only a few studies of land use-land cover changes which provide an integrated assessment of the biophysical and societal causes and consequences of environmental degradation in Istanbul. The research area comprised greater Silivri Town which is situated by the coast of Marmara Sea, and it is located approximately 60 km west of Istanbul. The city of Istanbul is one of the largest metropolises in Europe with ca. 15 million inhabitants. Additionally, greater Silivri is located near the terminal point of the state highway connecting Istanbul with Europe. Measuring of changes occurring in land use would help control future planning of settlements; hence, it is of importance for the Greater Silivri and Silivri Town. Following our evaluations, coastal zone of Silivri was classified into the land use groups of artificial surfaces agricultural areas and forests and seminatural areas with 47.1%, 12.66%, and 22.62%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Innovation and rapid technological development in Smart Medicine or Smart Healthcare impact profoundly on many aspects of healthcare. It is believed that Health Information Technology (HIT) has the potential to improve integration between care providers, reduce administrative costs and burdens, reduce medical errors, and improve care quality and patient outcomes. However, issues such as interoperability, compatibility, and integration are critical to effectively integrating hardware and software in order to fully realize the benefits of HIT. High-end medical devices and equipment, including medical carts / mobile computer carts and wireless physiological and biomedical monitoring devices, should also be integrated into the hospital information system. Furthermore, the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom Hierarchy (DIKW) has been gaining popularity in the development of Nursing Information Systems (NIS) since 2013. To create a DIKW-based information system, data must first be defined and analyzed and then transformed into meaningful information. Eventually, this information is transformed into an intelligent system. For example, if evidence-based nursing research results / findings are integrated into the NIS to guide clinical practice, patient outcomes, patient safety, and healthcare quality will be greatly enhanced.",

    "abstract": "Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is widely used for providing a convenient and efficient communicating platform between patients at home and physicians at medical centers or home health care (HHC) organizations. To ensure patient privacy, in 2013, Hao et al. proposed a chaotic map based authentication scheme with user anonymity for TMIS. Later, Lee showed that Hao et al.'s scheme is in no provision for providing fairness in session key establishment and gave an efficient user authentication and key agreement scheme using smart cards, in which only few hashing and Chebyshev chaotic map operations are required. In addition, Jiang et al. discussed that Hao et al.'s scheme can not resist stolen smart card attack and they further presented an improved scheme which attempts to repair the security pitfalls found in Hao et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we found that both Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes have a serious security problem in that a registered user's secret parameters may be intentionally exposed to many non-registered users and this problem causing the service misuse attack. Therefore, we propose a slight modification on Lee's scheme to prevent the shortcomings. Compared with previous schemes, our improved scheme not only inherits the advantages of Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes for TMIS but also remedies the serious security weakness of not being able to withstand service misuse attack.",

    "abstract": "Health information systems (HIS) are meant to support decision-making at all levels of the system, including frontline health workers. In field studies in Côte d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria, we observed health workers' interactions with the HIS and identified twelve decision-making components of HIS. The objective of this framework synthesis is to portray these components in HIS research, in order to inform the ideation of a paper-based HIS intervention (PHISICC). We searched studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Epistemonikos, Medline, in-Process on the Ovid platform, OpenGrey, PDQ Evidence (\"pretty darnd quick\" Evidence), the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Library and included studies focussing on HIS interventions, data quality, information support tools and data use for decision-making in the context of the governmental health care sector. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. We synthesised the findings based on the decision-making components of HIS and thematic areas. The search identified 6784 studies; 50 were included. Most of the 50 studies had quality concerns. All studies included at least one of the decision-making components: the most prominent were the technical aspects of 'recording' and 'reporting'. Data use for decision-making was much less represented. HIS research focuses on the more technical aspects of HIS. Further research on HIS, given the strong push towards HIS digitalisation, should consider putting at the centre the human experience of decision-making and data use, in order to make HIS relevant for quality of care.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can support vaccine forecasting and immunization reminders; however, immunization decision-making requires data from fragmented, independent systems. Interoperability and accurate data exchange between immunization information systems (IIS) is an essential factor to utilize Immunization CDS systems. Service oriented architecture (SOA) and Health Level 7 (HL7) are dominant standards for web-based exchange of clinical information. We implemented a system based on SOA and HL7 v3 to support immunization CDS in Iran. We evaluated system performance by exchanging 1500 immunization records for roughly 400 infants between two IISs. System turnaround time is less than a minute for synchronous operation calls and the retrieved immunization history of infants were always identical in different systems. CDS generated reports were accordant to immunization guidelines and the calculations for next visit times were accurate. Interoperability is rare or nonexistent between IIS. Since inter-state data exchange is rare in United States, this approach could be a good prototype to achieve interoperability of immunization information.",

Overall, the task completion rate was 96% while the success rate was 88%. The average time-on-task was 3.11 minutes, with more time spent on tasks requiring a user to stratify data along multiple dimensions, such as age, sex, or geographical region. Usability scores indicated that the current version of PopHR has good usability. Potential improvements identified included adding supporting information, offering different visualizations, and enhancing system stability.

In the Kochi Medical School Hospital, an online prescription order system has been developed as part of an integrated hospital information system named IMIS (the Integrated Medical Information System), in which all the physicians enter their prescription orders into online display terminals. The prescription order entry system is provided with prescription support functions, which check the entered prescription data, issue warnings, and offer information about drugs or patients. The prescription order system reduces the incidence of simple prescription mistakes and greatly decreases the cases of inquiries by pharmacists. However, results of the analysis show that such functions as warnings of double order and repeated prescription of a drug do not work as well as expected. The system would thus require some kind of intelligence like that of the auditing pharmacists or that of the physicians with accurate knowledge of clinical pharmacology.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, efficiency, and quality of health information system implementation into aged care. Three-stage, mixed-methods participatory action research, concurrent with the natural experiment of a co-designed health information system implementation into a 169-bed aged care home in Australia. Data were collected pre-, during, and post implementation between 2019 and 2021. Qualitative data included focus groups, interviews, and observations. Quantitative data included work observations, pedometers, record audits, incident reports and staff and resident surveys. There were 162 participants composed of 65 aged care residents, 90 staff, and 7 managers/consultants. Improved work efficiency included reduced staff time searching for information (6%); reduced nurse time on documentation (20.4% to 6.4%), and 25% less steps. Documentation improvement included resident assessments (68% to 96%); resident-focused goals (56% to 88%) and evaluations (31% to 88%). The staff reported being better equipped to manage the 'delicacies of dignity'. Implementation of a health information system into a residential aged care facility was associated with improved resident-focused care and staff efficiency. Technology can support nurses and care staff to spend more time with residents in residential aged care homes, improve the quality of resident care, and assist meeting regulatory reporting requirements. Flexible and tailored co-design strategies can enhance both effectiveness and success of technology implementation into residential aged care.",

    "abstract": "The need for an efficient and reliable health information system motivated Gabon, with the support of the World Bank, to finance a project to reinforce its health information system. An&#160;audit of this system was required to report on the reality of the existing system and tools. Over the course of two periods, May to September&#160;2016 and April to May&#160;2018, information was collected using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. In this framework, were carried out successively: participative workshops including health actors in Gabon, a survey of health care workers, an analysis of reference documents relating to national health policies, and an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the system. In total, 171&#160;health care professionals participated in the different workshops, and 770&#160;others were questioned among 150&#160;health care establishments from 10&#160;health care regions of the country. At the end of this research work, organizational and technical problems were noted at the level of the health information system of Gabon, notably the absence of a judicial framework defining the roles and responsibilities of the different actors of the system, weak data management, a stovepipe information system, several non-interoperable IT applications, and weak completeness rate, at 30%. Among the 770&#160;health care professionals surveyed, 539 (70%) were favorable to a new information system. As for the main assets, we noted the existence of computing equipment and acceptable internet coverage, 31.5% of the health care establishments are connected via cable. This research sheds light on the existing health information system and should enable the implementation of a new system.",

    "title": "Does pharmaceutical information systems data inform decision-making in public healthcare? Utility of a national system in a limited resource setting.",
    "abstract": "Globally, weak pharmaceutical information systems (PIS) negatively affect universal health coverage and outcomes. Few studies in sub-Saharan Africa qualitatively and quantitatively assess drivers and utility of data from PIS in public healthcare. A nationwide cross-sectional descriptive study interviewed PIS focal persons in all 14 regions of Namibia. The primary outcome was extent and predictors of utility of PIS data. The extent of utility of PIS data was determined using descriptive statistics and predictors by logistic regression in SPSSv24 or thematic analysis for qualitative data. The study recruited 58 key informants at facility-based 56 (96.6%) and national 2 (3.4%) levels. Of the 56 facility-based respondents, 29 (51.8%) were female and 27 (48.2%) pharmacists. The mean age and PIS work experience were 33.5 ± 7.6years and 4.5 ± 3.3years respectively. The utility level of PIS data was 34 (60.7%) (target >80%). A total of 103 uses of PIS data were cited; of which 38 (36.9%) were informing decisions on rational medicine use, 27 (26.2%) on pharmaceutical stock management and 24 (23.3%) on strengthening pharmacy workforce. The utility of PIS data significantly decreased with lack of systems on routine reporting by health facility in-charge (cOR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.06,0.90, p = 0.035). Longer work experience (cOR = 1.05, 95%CI: 0.88,1.25, p = 0.58), formal consultations (cOR = 1.29, 95%CI: 0.14,11.54, p = 0.82), and availability of feedback systems (cOR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.33,3.56, p = 0.89) appeared to increase utility of PIS data. Two thematic drivers of utility of PIS data were programmatic \"feedback and action on PIS; structures,technical supportfor PIS discussion\"; technical \"training/technical capacity of staff; tools and resources for data collection and utilization\"; and human-resource \"staff availability and workload; attitude and commitment\". The nationwide study shows sub-optimal utility of PIS data in public healthcare in Namibia, which negatively affects delivery of pharmaceutical services. This calls for action to enhance capabilities for utilization of automated real-time pharmaceutical information decision support systems to enhance real-time analysis and feedback on medicines data in resource-limited settings.",

Nevertheless, few systematic studies have reported what methods, such as standards, processes, and tools, were proposed to evaluate HIS quality. This study aimed to identify and discuss the existing literature that describes standards, processes, and tools used to evaluate HIS quality. We conducted a systematic literature review using review guidelines focused on software and systems. We examined seven electronic databases-Scopus, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PubMed-to search for and select primary studies. Out of 782 papers, we identified 17 (2.2%) primary studies. We found that most of the primary studies addressed quality evaluation from a management perspective. On the other hand, there was little explicit and pragmatic evidence on the processes and tools that allowed for the evaluation of HIS quality. To promote quality evaluation of HISs, it is necessary to define mechanisms and methods that operationalize the standards in HISs. Additionally, it is necessary to create metrics that measure the quality of the most critical components and processes of HISs.",

Existing electronic CPG repositories like the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) provide individual access but lack standardized computer-readable interfaces necessary for automated guideline retrieval. The aim of this paper was to facilitate automated context-based selection and presentation of CPGs. Using attributes from the NGC classification scheme, an XML-based metadata repository was successfully implemented, providing document storage, classification and retrieval functionality. Semi-automated extraction of attributes was implemented for the import of XML guideline documents using XPath. A hospital information system interface was exemplarily implemented for diagnosis-based guideline invocation. Limitations of the implemented system are discussed and possible future work is outlined. Integration of standardized computer-readable search interfaces into existing CPG repositories is proposed.",

    "title": "Challenges that limit meaningful use of health information technology.",
    "abstract": "Health information technology (HIT) is perceived as an essential component for addressing inefficiencies in healthcare. Without understanding the challenges that limit meaningful use of HIT, there is a high chance that institutions will convert complex paper-based systems to expensive digital chaos. Clinical information systems do not communicate with each other automatically because integration of existing data standards is lacking. Data standards for medical specialties need further development. Database architectures are often designed to support single clinical applications and are not easily modified to meet the enterprise-wide needs desired by all end-users. Despite the improvements in charge capture and better access to health information the realized savings and impact on patient throughput is not enough to cover the cost of the technology, maintenance, and support. HIT is necessary for improved quality of care but it increases the cost of doing business. Poor user interface and system design hinders clinical workflow and can result in wasted time, poor data collection, misleading data analysis, and potentially negative clinical outcomes. Healthcare organizations have little recourse if a vendor fails to deliver as intended once the vendor's system becomes embedded into the organization. Decisions on technology acquisitions and implementations are often made by individuals or groups that lack clinical informatics expertise. Government incentives to increase HIT will likely result in a more computerized clinical environment. Understanding the challenges can help avoid costly mistakes. The future looks promising but caution is warranted, as achievement of full benefits of HIT requires addressing significant challenges.",

Although all its details are not known at present, its essential characteristics are elucidated, as well for the replication or transcription as for the translation of the genetic message. A coherent picture now appears, which reveals the existence of an universal structure, the most fundamental features of which seem to obey some logic. A systematic approach has been devised, which aims to their integration in a theorectical scheme: many features of the code table can thus be interpreted as resulting from a unique principle of best resistance against the effects of mutations. Any group of triplets or amino-acids can be considered along this line. It is more difficult however, to analyse the coexistence of two (or more) different groups. In this work, we propose to extend our optimization principle into a more general one, which includes the notion of information as defined by Shannon. We explore some consequences of this new principle in the most simple models that one can build for the origin and evolution of the genetic code.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the attitudes of Iranian nurses towards clinical information systems in nursing practice. Nurses are essential in the successful adoption and implementation of clinical information systems. A systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science and Farsi databases, to retrieve relevant studies. The methodological quality of the studies is assessed via the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies. The random effect model was utilized to analyse the data due to the high heterogeneity in the included studies (n = 17). Results indicate that clinical information systems impact on at least seven aspects of nursing practice, including documentation, patient safety, quality of treatment, communication, treatment management, nursing tasks and hospital resource management. Results also indicated that one aspect of using clinical information systems in nursing practice is satisfaction with the 'quality and design of clinical information systems', such as ease of use and learning, flexibility and software speed. Clinical information systems can contribute to different aspects of nursing practice. However, their design should improve significantly in order to help nurses perform their professional activities in an efficient and satisfactory manner. Before the full deployment of clinical information systems, their usability should be tested. In pilot testing, nurses should provide necessary feedback about how well the systems work and improvements needed to meet their professional goals.",

    "title": "Transformation of Arden Syntax's medical logic modules into ArdenML for a business rules management system.",
    "abstract": "Arden Syntax is a Health Level Seven International (HL7) standard language that is used for representing medical knowledge as logic statements. Arden Syntax Markup Language (ArdenML) is a new representation of Arden Syntax based on XML. Compilers are required to execute medical logic modules (MLMs) in the hospital environment. However, ArdenML may also replace the compiler. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that MLMs, encoded in ArdenML, can be transformed into a commercial rule engine format through an XSLT stylesheet and made executable in a target system. The target rule engine selected was Blaze Advisor. We developed an XSLT stylesheet to transform MLMs in ArdenML into Structured Rules Language (SRL) in Blaze Advisor, through a comparison of syntax between the two languages. The stylesheet was then refined recursively, by building and applying rules collected from the billing and coding guidelines of the Korean health insurance service. Two nurse coders collected and verified the rules and two information technology (IT) specialists encoded the MLMs and built the XSLT stylesheet. Finally, the stylesheet was validated by importing the MLMs into Blaze Advisor and applying them to claims data. The language comparison revealed that Blaze Advisor requires the declaration of variables with explicit types. We used both integer and real numbers for numeric types in ArdenML. \"IF∼THEN\" statements and assignment statements in ArdenML become rules in Blaze Advisor. We designed an XSLT stylesheet to solve this issue. In addition, we maintained the order of rule execution in the transformed rules, and added two small programs to support variable declarations and action statements. A total of 1489 rules were reviewed during this study, of which 324 rules were collected. We removed duplicate rules and encoded 241 unique MLMs in ArdenML, which were successfully transformed into SRL and imported to Blaze Advisor via the XSLT stylesheet. When applied to 73,841 outpatients' insurance claims data, the review result was the same as that of the legacy system. We have demonstrated that ArdenML can replace a compiler for transforming MLMs into commercial rule engine format. While the proposed XSLT stylesheet requires refinement for general use, we anticipate that the development of further XSLT stylesheets will support various rule engines.",

    "title": "A novel approach to find and optimize bin locations and collection routes using a geographic information system.",
    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in big cities is planning and implementation of an optimized, integrated solid waste management system. This optimization is crucial if environmental problems are to be prevented and the expenses to be reduced. A solid waste management system consists of many stages including collection, transfer and disposal. In this research, an integrated model was proposed and used to optimize two functional elements of municipal solid waste management (storage and collection systems) in the Ahmadabad neighbourhood located in the City of Mashhad - Iran. The integrated model was performed by modelling and solving the location allocation problem and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) through Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results showed that the current collection system is not efficient owing to its incompatibility with the existing urban structure and population distribution. Application of the proposed model could significantly improve the storage and collection system. Based on the results of minimizing facilities analyses, scenarios with 100, 150 and 180 m walking distance were considered to find optimal bin locations for Alamdasht, C-metri and Koohsangi. The total number of daily collection tours was reduced to seven as compared to the eight tours carried out in the current system (12.50% reduction). In addition, the total number of required crews was minimized and reduced by 41.70% (24 crews in the current collection system vs 14 in the system provided by the model). The total collection vehicle routing was also optimized such that the total travelled distances during night and day working shifts was cut back by 53%.",

We also provided educational resources and automated advice programs. We provided access to the system to thirteen subjects over a 36-month period and reviewed their activities in the system's usage log. We also collected data via questionnaire and telephone interview. We collected data for a total of 223 patient months. We found that patients varied in their use of the system, from once a month or less to one or more times per day. All patients primarily used the system to review laboratory results. Both they and their physicians believed that use of the system enhanced the patients' understanding of their conditions and improved their communication with their physicians.

A shared information space should enable appropriate preparation and provision of relevant information at any time before, during, and after surgery. Based on previous work on an interaction concept and system architecture for the sterile OR-Pad system, we designed a user interface for mobile and intraoperative (stationary) use, focusing on the most important functionalities like clear information provision to reduce information overload. The concepts were transferred into a high-fidelity prototype for demonstration purposes. The prototype was evaluated from different perspectives, including a usability study. The prototype's central element is a timeline displaying all available case information chronologically, like radiological images, labor findings, or notes. This information space can be adapted for individual purposes (e.g., highlighting a tumor, filtering for own material). With the mobile and intraoperative mode of the system, relevant information can be added, preselected, viewed, and extended during the perioperative process. Overall, the evaluation showed good results and confirmed the vision of the information system. The high-fidelity prototype of the information system OR-Pad focuses on supporting the surgeon via a timeline making all available case information accessible before, during, and after surgery. The information space can be personalized to enable targeted support. Further development is reasonable to optimize the approach and address missing or insufficient aspects, like the holding arm and sterility concept or new desired features.",

A blockmodel analysis of patient referrals, consultations, discussions, and on-call coverage identified four groups of physicians who share common locations and perform similar roles within the network. Investigation of the shared attributes of these groups supports this relational structure. The results suggest that the center-periphery model of diffusion of new ideas among professionals may be too simplistic. Instead, the communication network may involve multiple central cohesive subgroups of physicians who differentially initiate patient referrals and consultations with physicians in other subgroups. Network location was found to have a significant effect on the adoption and utilization of the HIS independently of background and practice characteristics of physicians. The results also suggest that adoption of an innovation and its implementation or utilization may involve separate processes that need to be differentiated in future research.",

Currently there is an increasing awareness of the importance of evaluating and measuring the impact of such systems in clinical practice. Implementations often fail, due to inadequate interaction between technology and human elements. This article describes a research project aimed at evaluating the impact of a clinical nursing information system (CNIS), called Professional Assessment Instrument (PAI), in clinical practice. The study will evaluate PAI Quality, Nurses Satisfaction, PAI Use, Nurses and Environment Characteristics, Net Benefits and Nurses' Experiences related to the PAI use. A theoretical model developed for this research will guide the study. A quali-quantitative longitudinal design will be performed involving two hospitals over a 9-month period. To measure different dimensions that affect the success/failure of CNIS we will use different tools/ methods of data collection (questionnaires, psychometric tools, surveys and focus groups). This study will evaluate the impact of a CNIS in hospitals providing an overview of the factors which can help and hinder the implementation of an information system. The results of the study will support interventions to improve and implement clinical information systems designed to computerize nursing data, with positive effects on public health and research in general, providing further evidence for health policy.",

One of the challenges facing the HOLON consortium is determining what kinds of components can be made available in a library for developers of clinical information systems. To further explore the use of component architectures in the development of reusable clinical subsystems, we have incorporated ongoing work in the development of enterprise terminology services into a Problem List subsystem for the HOLON testbed. We have successfully implemented a set of components using CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and Java distributed object technologies that provide a functional problem list application and UMLS-based \"Problem Picker.\" Through this development, we have overcome a variety of obstacles characteristic of rapidly emerging technologies, and have identified architectural issues necessary to scale these components for use and reuse within an enterprise clinical information system.",

    "title": "Securing interoperability between chip card based medical information systems and health networks.",
    "abstract": "Health information systems supporting shared care are going to be distributed and interoperable. Dealing with sensitive personal medical information, such information systems have to provide appropriate security services, allowing only authorised users restricted access rights to the patients' data according to the 'need to know' principle. Especially in healthcare, chip card based information systems occur in the shape of patient data cards providing informational self determination and mobility of the users as well as quality, integrity, accountability, and availability of the data stored on the card, thus improving the shared care of patients. The DIABCARD project aims at the implementation and evaluation of a chip card based medical information system (CCMIS) for facilitating communication and co-operation between health professionals in different organisations or departments caring the same patient with diabetes as an example. In co-operation with the EC-funded TrustHealth(2) project, communication and application security services needed are provided like strong authentication as well as the derived services such as authorisation, access control, accountability, confidentiality, etc. The solution is based on Health Professional Cards and Trusted Third Party services. In addition to the secure handling of the patient's chip card and data in DIABCARD workstations, the secure communication between these workstations and related departmental systems has been implemented. Based on the results of this feasibility study, an enhanced security services specification for the DIABCARD example of a CCMIS is provided which will be implemented in the framework of a health network being established in the German federal state Bavaria. Beside the preferred solution of a combination of Patient Identification Card and Patient Data Card, lower level alternatives using card-verifiable certificates are explained in some details. Finally, a few legal issues, future trends like the XML standard set and their implications for the solution presented as well as for distributed health information systems in general are shortly discussed.",

    "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges facing healthcare professionals is the ability to directly and efficiently access relevant data from the patient's healthcare record at the point of care; specific to both the context of the task being performed and the specific needs and preferences of the individual end-user. In radiology practice, the relative inefficiency of imaging data organization and manual workflow requirements serves as an impediment to historical imaging data review. At the same time, clinical data retrieval is even more problematic due to the quality and quantity of data recorded at the time of order entry, along with the relative lack of information system integration. One approach to address these data deficiencies is to create a multi-disciplinary patient referenceable database which consists of high-priority, actionable data within the cumulative patient healthcare record; in which predefined criteria are used to categorize and classify imaging and clinical data in accordance with anatomy, technology, pathology, and time. The population of this referenceable database can be performed through a combination of manual and automated methods, with an additional step of data verification introduced for data quality control. Once created, these referenceable databases can be filtered at the point of care to provide context and user-specific data specific to the task being performed and individual end-user requirements.",

    "abstract": "Tourism safety is the focus of the tourism industry. It is not only related to the safety of tourists' lives and property, but also related to social stability and sustainable development of the tourism industry. However, the security early warning of many scenic spots focuses on the response measures and remedial plans after the occurrence of security incidents, and the staff of many scenic spots have limited security awareness and information analysis ability, which is prone to lag in information release, and do not pay attention to the information of potential security problems. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization algorithm of the tourism security early warning information system based on the LSTM model and uses the recurrent neural network and LSTM to improve the processing and prediction ability of time-series data. The experimental results show that the number of three hidden layers in the tourism security early warning information system based on the LSTM model can reduce the training time of the model and improve the performance. Compared with the tourism safety early warning information system based on the BP neural network, it has better accuracy and stability, has better processing and prediction ability for time series data, and can monitor and analyze data scientifically in real-time and dynamically analyze data.",

    "abstract": "Within public health, there is a tradition of co-operation between researchers and communities in planning and implementation of health promotion programs. As a consequence, public-health organizations are characterized by having complex multidisciplinary structure and dynamic organizational goals. In this paper, we discuss the economic impacts from the use of Participatory Design for development of public-health information systems. Creation of systems that have both utility and usability is suggested to be highlighted as the central goal. The identified pre-requisites for a positive impact are that the new system should be of high quality, appropriate to the nature of the health promotion tasks, and to how activities are coordinated and integrated both between and within the stakeholder groups involved. We argue further that a method that minimizes the information asymmetry in the development process is necessary for avoiding market failures 1. The conclusion is that participatory design will diminish transaction costs, will help to avoid sunk costs, and will contribute to rich efficient use of human and economic resources in public-health organizations.",

This setting creates difficulties in the transport and sharing of data among applications that serve a common functionality. We present an alternative approach for the design of clinical trials information systems consisting of loosely coupled components standing on a comprehensive model of the global clinical trial process. We describe how such a structure is able to support the development and implementation of complex knowledge-driven modules, such as automated database query systems, reporting systems and intelligent data-analysis tools, and how currently available internet technologies may be used to support the independent development of applications and collaboration between researchers. These principles were applied to the development of a fully functional system that has been in production for eight years in a diversity of pharmaceutical and academic drug trials. Marked time savings in database set-up and statistical reporting have been documented, as well as good reliability in the selection of appropriate statistical methods to clinical trial data analysis. In order to meet the expected functionality and to avoid the proliferation of databases and software applications, clinical trials information systems need to be based on a generic model of clinical trials and on a distributed architecture.",

The NIS was part of the electronic health record with 200 evidence-based, interdisciplinary clinical practice guidelines from which clinicians selected to guide the patient's care. A purposeful sample of 12 randomly selected nurses in three units across two hospitals participated in scenario-testing. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, content analyzed, and coded for themes. Major themes emerged: computer placement in patient rooms; difficulty using NIS; documentation completeness; efficiency; time spent at the bedside; team communication; training; unintended consequences of workflow changes; perceived NIS value as challenge to adoption. Nurse executives' opportunities to improve adoption include enhancing communication to/from front-line clinicians about the hospitals' goals, perceived NIS value at the bedside, and constructive feedback especially for patient care/safety and software functionality.",

This rabies information system is based on a homogeneous and coordinated system of surveillance in connection with prophylaxis and control of rabies. It includes a modification of the case record, suggested by the WHO-Expert-Committee on Rabies. The aims of this rabies information system are: to make obvious the epizootiological situation with formation and change of foci, to show the epidemiological importance of special animals and to recognize the epidemiological situation. All this has to be fulfilled in an integrated system. Furthermore optimal treatment is guaranteed by express diagnostics and earliest possible special treatment of high-risk groups by the co-operation of human and veterinary medicine. The rabies information system was generally introduced in the GDR in 1970. It has proved to be practicable and effective especially by standardization of diagnostics, recording exposure of the patient, his treatment and partly automated evaluations of situation records and documentation of efficiency.",

The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was integrated with a GIS to produce an Erosion Prediction Information System (EPIS) and modified to reflect conditions found in the mountainous tropics. Research was conducted in the Zenzontia subcatchment of the Río Ayuquíla, located within the Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve (SMBR), México. Expanding agricultural activities within this area will accentuate the already high rate of soil erosion and resultant sediment loading occurring in the Río Ayuquíla. Two land-use change scenarios are modeled with the EPIS: (1) implementation of soil conservation practices in erosion prone locations; and (2) selection of sites for agricultural expansion which minimize potential soil loss. Confronted with limited financial resources and the necessity for expedient action, managers of the SMBR can draw upon the predictive capacity of the EPIS to facilitate rapid and informed land-use planning decisions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine nurses' attitudes and reflection on the transformation of their workpractices after the implementation of an Emergency Department Information System (EDIS). A qualitative study using interviews, mainly with nurses, conducted four years after the implementation of an EDIS at the emergency department (ED) of a large university hospital in Midlands, UK. The introduction of waiting time targets for patients attending EDs and the spatial expansion of these clinical settings so as to support increasing numbers of attendances challenged the viability of paper records and whiteboards in the management of patient flows within the department. They also fostered the use of an information system for accumulating information and coordinating the activities of the multidisciplinary team. While whiteboards were abolished, paper still plays a role in nursing practice in response to issues of confidentiality, personal safety, ergonomics, computer literacy, interoperability, relationship with patients and overdependence on EDIS. ED information systems can have a major impact on organisational practices particularly as new service models of care are gradually introduced in EDs. Considering their spatio-temporal implications while treating the technology as an artifact with transformative, rather than supportive or substitutive, power enhances our understanding of the implementation challenges that need to be addressed during the reshaping of the sociotechnical network.",

    "title": "Genomes as geography: using GIS technology to build interactive genome feature maps.",
    "abstract": "Many commonly used genome browsers display sequence annotations and related attributes as horizontal data tracks that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences. Most genome browsers use only simple keyword searches and limit the display of detailed annotations to one chromosomal region of the genome at a time. We have employed concepts, methodologies, and tools that were developed for the display of geographic data to develop a Genome Spatial Information System (GenoSIS) for displaying genomes spatially, and interacting with genome annotations and related attribute data. In contrast to the paradigm of horizontally stacked data tracks used by most genome browsers, GenoSIS uses the concept of registered spatial layers composed of spatial objects for integrated display of diverse data. In addition to basic keyword searches, GenoSIS supports complex queries, including spatial queries, and dynamically generates genome maps. Our adaptation of the geographic information system (GIS) model in a genome context supports spatial representation of genome features at multiple scales with a versatile and expressive query capability beyond that supported by existing genome browsers. We implemented an interactive genome sequence feature map for the mouse genome in GenoSIS, an application that uses ArcGIS, a commercially available GIS software system. The genome features and their attributes are represented as spatial objects and data layers that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences or displayed selectively in response to user queries. GenoSIS supports the generation of custom genome maps in response to complex queries about genome features based on both their attributes and locations. Our example application of GenoSIS to the mouse genome demonstrates the powerful visualization and query capability of mature GIS technology applied in a novel domain. Mapping tools developed specifically for geographic data can be exploited to display, explore and interact with genome data. The approach we describe here is organism independent and is equally useful for linear and circular chromosomes. One of the unique capabilities of GenoSIS compared to existing genome browsers is the capacity to generate genome feature maps dynamically in response to complex attribute and spatial queries.",

    "abstract": "The NOAA Center of Excellence for Oceans and Human Health Initiative (OHHI) at the Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML) is developing a data management framework that supports an integrated research program across scientific disciplines. The primary focus of the database is to support environmental research focused on tidal creek watershed systems. Specifically, the current data holdings include physical water quality parameters, nutrients, pathogens, chemical contaminants, benthic and nekton species abundances and human dimensions data from Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina dating to 1994. These data are not from a single long-term research project but are derived from several state and federal research programs and integrated into a common database model to support current research being conducted under the OHHI program at HML. The Tidal Creek database was developed with the intent to support a well documented and open system, thus metadata elements from common metadata standards including the Dublin Core ISO 15836:2003 and Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC-STD-001-1998) are components of the database model. The result is a semantic database framework with descriptive ancillary data at the record level including methods, investigator names, date, locations and other descriptive elements. The primary users of the database are project personnel to meet analytical needs. The database is also available through a number of web-based applications that are designed to give users the necessary information to evaluate and access data. In addition, data can be accessed with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, and species records and abundances are being made available to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). Overall, the Tidal Creek database summarizes the response of tidal creeks and watersheds to coastal development, and serves as a repository for environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic data in the Southeast.",

The field assessment followed a standard procedure including geographical coordinates of each accession, leaf biomass randomly harvested, identification of associate species, collection of herbarium specimen, soil sample and digital pictures of the site. By overlaying morphological and chemical data with geomorphic information, a thematic map was created locating the podophyllotoxin-rich accessions and the uniqueness of each site was recorded for post-collection analysis. This work has enabled the establishment of a database of P. peltatum germplasm in Mississippi with drug yield linked to spatial locations for rational utilization of our natural resources. While this method integrates information of well-characterized diverse in situ P. peltatum germplasm, it might become a strategy for curators to reduce cost for establishing and maintaining ex situ collections since the genetic material is geo-referenced.",

A well-defined and sustainable EU health information system infrastructure is lacking. The potential of a European Research Infrastructure Consortium on Health Information for Research and Evidence-based Policy (HIREP-ERIC) to take up this role is investigated. Two working groups, a BRIDGE Health Steering Committee and the European Commission's Drafting Group of the Expert Group on Health Information, discussed the technical and scientific description of the HIREP-ERIC through a consensus-driven modified Delphi technique. Consensus was reached on three aspects of the HIREP-ERIC. First, it was defined as an infrastructure that facilitates interaction of networks and experts in health information by providing central governance and a more permanent collaboration. Second, the infrastructure should be distributed, with a central hub coordinating the operation of distributed networks. Third, it should provide easy access to high quality and comparable data for purposes of research and policy making, and focus its activities around generating, managing, exchanging and translating health information. A momentum has been created where representatives from 16 European countries agreed on the HIREP-ERIC as a pragmatic bottom-up approach to strengthen the current EU health information landscape. A Member States' commitment is needed at senior political level to make this consensus operational.",

    "title": "Reinventing vital statistics. The impact of changes in information technology, welfare policy, and health care.",
    "abstract": "Vital statistics offers a case study in the potential of new information technology and reengineering to achieve better public sector performance. New technology--notably the shift from a paper to an electronic process for recording vital events and transmitting the data to public agencies--is creating opportunities to produce more timely, accurate, and useful information. The furthest advanced innovation is the electronic birth certificate. At the same time, changes in welfare policy and health care--including efforts to establish paternity at the time of birth and to improve health care outcomes--are creating pressures for more policy-relevant data about vital events. In addition, the rise of integrated health plans and health information networks is radically altering the organizational context of vital statistics. On the basis of a State-by-State survey of vital statistics officials, the authors estimate that at the end of 1994, 58 percent of all births in the United States were being recorded on an electronic birth certificate and communicated to a public agency electronically. Nearly all respondents reported that the electronic birth certificate brought improvements in both timeliness and accuracy of data. Achieving the full promise of the new technology, however, will require more fundamental changes in institutions and policies and a reconceptualization of the birth certificate as part of a broader perinatal information system.",

However, CIS implementation in developing countries poses additional, different challenges from the developed countries. Therefore, this research aimed to systematically review the literature, gathering and integrating research findings on Success Factors (SFs) in CIS implementation for developing countries. This helps to integrate past knowledge and develop a set of recommendations, presented as a framework, for implementing CIS in developing countries. A systematic literature review was conducted, followed by qualitative data analysis on the published articles related to requirements and SF for CIS implementation. Eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data analysis. Thematic analysis and cross-case analysis were applied to identify and categorize the requirements and SF for CIS implementation in developing countries. Six major requirement categories were identified including project management, financial resources, government involvement and support, human resources, organizational, and technical requirements. Subcategories related to SF are classified under each major requirement. A set of recommendations is provided, presented in a framework, based on the project management lifecycle approach. The proposed framework could support CIS implementations in developing countries while enhancing their rate of success. Future studies should focus on identifying barriers to CIS implementation in developing countries. The country-specific empirical studies should also be conducted based on this research's findings to match the local context.",

A sense of ownership contributes in turn to the long-term sustainability of the HIS, and thus the country's ability to monitor and evaluate population health and health services. To facilitate progress toward greater ownership, we developed and tested a tool to measure the country's ownership of its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified four dimensions of country ownership of an M&E system: partnership, commitment and responsibility, capacity, and accountability. We identified relevant indicators of the dimensions already in use in other tools used to assess M&E systems. We tested the data collection tool with 95 stakeholders of the Tanzanian HIS for HIV/AIDS control. We identified 56 items that addressed elements of the four dimensions. The respondents found our tool for assessing country ownership of an HIS to be clear and relevant, leading to the identification of important issues to be discussed. For example, all stakeholder groups affirmed that the Tanzanian Commission for AIDS is \"playing a leadership role in addressing HIV through collaborative partnerships and work across borders to achieve greater impact.\" While many respondents disagreed with the statement, \"There is an adequate number of government monitoring and evaluation posts at the sub-national level.\" Stakeholders found the M&E country ownership tool to address relevant questions clearly. It enabled them to identify successes and challenges within four dimensions of country ownership. It thus holds the potential to lead to an agenda for strengthening country ownership. If implemented every few years, the tool can provide a means of monitoring progress through a set of standardized indicators. As country ownership of M&E increases, so will the long-term sustainability of the HIS.",

MET3 integrates with external hospital information systems via HL7 messages and runs on various computing platforms available at the point of care (e.g., tablet computers, mobile phones). Building MET3 required sophisticated and reliable software technologies. In the past decade the open source software movement has produced mature, stable, industrial strength software systems with a large user base. Therefore, one of the decisions that should be considered before developing or acquiring a decision support system is whether or not one could use open source technologies instead of proprietary ones. We believe MET3 shows that the answer to this question is positive.",

    "title": "Lessons from evaluating an automated patient severity index.",
    "abstract": "To report lessons learned from evaluation of an automated interface between a hospital clinical information system and a severity of illness index. A system was developed to convert coded electronic patient findings from the HELP System at LDS Hospital into the attributes used by the Computerized Severity Index (CSI) to calculate a severity of illness score. Performance was assessed by comparing the automated CSI score with the manual CSI score (from paper chart review) and by evaluating changes introduced by augmenting the manual CSI score with verified patient data discovered by the automated CSI method. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are presented. The automated CSI score matched the manual CSI score in 61% of the cases. Sources of errors were analyzed. When the automated score was in error, two-thirds of the time it was due to the lack of codes in the HELP system representing CSI concepts; one-third of the time it was due to nurses not using established HELP system codes. Surprisingly, significant problems were also discovered in the manual system, making it difficult to define a \"gold standard\". Automated computerized severity indices have great potential for future applicability once their performance exceeds that of the time-consuming manual chart review method. Neither automated nor manual methods are adequate at the present time. This area remains a fertile ground for future research.",

In this regard, the data and evidence that the health structure has on the population is of vital importance. was to evaluate the quality of data on sexual and reproductive health of migrant and indigenous women in Chile. We approach this issue from a perspective that emphasizes the importance of the State and its institutions relying on their populations to implement more effective and efficient social policies. The Monthly Statistical Summaries (REM) prepared by the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS) for the years 2012 to 2024 were reviewed. Regarding coherence, the origin of the data is the same, however, the codes have changed over time, this is where not all the dimensions observed have the indigenous or migrant category. Regarding availability, there is no clear differentiation between cells with zeros or empty cases, which makes the interpretation and completeness of the data difficult. The findings show a phenomenon that we have called \"negative interdependence\" which generates bias with respect to the information collected by the health information system (DEIS-Chile) that perpetuates the health inequities of the observed populations and, above all, omits the subnational territorial context as a basis for the continuous improvement of health systems.",

However currently web-based applications are better suited to information \"browsing\" than to build complex data entry features. This prompted us to start with our first web based developments inside the Giessen University Hospital Information System in the field of pure presentation of stored knowledge and information. This article describes the concepts which will be used in Giessen to convert available information sources to the www paradigm and to implement context-sensitive knowledge presentation mechanisms inside the clinical information system. The approach is based upon a web-based medical data dictionary server. The data dictionary is used to map terms of interest, chosen from the clinical user during work with a HIS-application, to a semantic network of relationships. The dictionary server will follow those semantic links in order to find and display the webpages, which are linked to the subject.",

However, applying information technology must consider many factors apart from system design and development. Such other factors include effectiveness in reducing user reliance on memory faculties, ability to streamline work processes, and capacity to recommend viable decisions. This paper provides an example of the nursing instruction information system deployment process. In addition to describing the development and implementation, applications of patient education and nursing decision-making are also presented. It is hoped that this experience may serve as reference to other healthcare institutions in the process of building nursing information systems.",

    "abstract": "The fact that traditional energy sources have limited reserves and have a negative impact on the environment increases the demand for renewable energy sources. Environmental, economic, and sustainability concerns have led researchers, investors, and policy makers to seek the potential of renewable energy sources. Suitable site selection for new-generation renewable resources is vital in large-scale projects. In this paper, geographic information systems and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods were integrated to exploit and construct the best location for solar PV power plants in Kayseri, Turkey. Three main, twelve subcriteria, and their indicators related to the study area were determined. The rank-based (i.e., rank sum, rank reciprocal weights, and rank order centroid weights) and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) MCDM methods were used to determine the weights of the criteria. Thirty-three existing solar PV power plants were used to verify the success of MCDM methods. Four MCDM methods yielded effective results according to the proposed criteria, and most of the existing solar PV power plants match the convenient regions on the suitability map provided by geographic information systems-based rank reciprocal method. In addition, according to the experimental study, Sarız, Tomarza, and Incesu districts of Kayseri were the most suitable sites.",

    "abstract": "The Thailand universal health care coverage scheme was instituted in 2001 and The Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is restructuring its information systems to support this reform. The MOPH anticipates developing computerized health information systems which can provide information for administration tasks and can improve both healthcare delivery and public health services. To achieve these target goals, knowledge about users and organizations is vital. The knowledge of how health center workers currently use information technology (IT), their knowledge of IT, and acceptance of IT are not only beneficial to policy makers but also to system designers and implementers. The primary objective of this study is to learn how health centers in Thailand use IT, the level of basic IT knowledge among their workers, and their acceptance of health IT. We surveyed a random cross sectional sample of 1,607 health centers representing the total of 9,806 in Thailand in 2005. With an 82% response rate, the preliminary results indicate that information technology usage is pervasive in health centers. The respondents showed a moderately high degree of health information technology acceptance with a modest level of basic IT knowledge. There were no differences in degrees of acceptance among the four geographic regions. The mean score of \"intention to use IT\" was 5.6 on a scale of 7 and the average basic IT knowledge score was 13 out of 20. These results suggests the possibility of project success if the national health center information system projects are developed and implemented.",

    "title": "Transition to a new nursing information system embedded with clinical decision support: a mixed-method study using the HOT-fit framework.",
    "abstract": "Nursing information systems embedded with standardized nursing language and clinical decision support have been increasingly introduced in health care settings. User experience is key to the adoption of health information technologies. Despite extensive research into the user experience with nursing information systems, few studies have focused on the interaction between user, technology and organizational attributes during its implementation. Guided by the human, organization and technology-fit framework, this study aimed to investigate nurses' perceptions and experiences with transition to a new nursing information system (Care Direct) 2 years after its first introduction. This is a mixed-method study using an embedded design. An online survey was launched to collect nurses' self-reported use of the new system, perceived system effectiveness and experience of participation in system optimization. Twenty-two semi structured interviews were conducted with twenty nurses with clinical or administrative roles. The quantitative and qualitative data were merged using the Pillar Integration Process. The average score of system use behavior was 3.76 ± 0.79. Regarding perceived system effectiveness, the score of each dimension ranged 3.07-3.34 out of 5. Despite large variations in approaches to participating in system optimization, nurses had generally positive experiences with management and technical support. Eight main categories emerged from the integrated findings, which were further condensed into three themes: perceptions on system content, structure, and functionality; perceptions on interdisciplinary and cross-level cooperation; and embracing and accepting the change. Effective collaboration between clinicians, administrators and technical staff is required during system promotion to enhance system usability and user experience. Clear communication of organizational missions to staff and support from top management is needed to smooth the system implementation process and achieve broader system adoption.",

To illustrate these four steps a detailed description of the selection of patients with a percutaneous renal biopsy is given, using the central database of Leiden University Hospital. All registrations relating to patients undergoing a percutaneous renal biopsy in 1985 and 1986 were taken into account and combined in defining the design and criteria for selection. The selection resulted in 182 patient-records, of which 177 were compared with the medical file. Overall 150 percutaneous biopsies were confirmed. Hospital Information Systems are in principle useful as sampling frames for clinical research. However, to use these systems successfully in selecting a study population intensive mutual consultation between clinicians, clinical epidemiologists, database experts and administrative personnel is required.",

According to the requirements of the six sections, the function of the teaching supervision and management module is improved. Through the test of result extraction and data analysis, the feasibility of the user preference extraction and analysis algorithm and the content similarity discrimination algorithm is finally verified. The results show that after more than 10 times of reading, the graphics of video teaching content can basically solve the problem of comparative similarity of the same type of teaching content. At the same time, after more than 30 times of reading, the teaching content can basically solve the problem of small probability error of user system.",

Moreover, the extension of password guessing attack leads to more security weaknesses. Therefore, this protocol needs improvement in terms of security before implementing in real-life application. To fix the mentioned security pitfalls, this paper proposes an improved scheme over Giri et al.'s scheme, which preserves user anonymity property. We have then simulated the proposed protocol using widely-accepted AVISPA tool which ensures that the protocol is SAFE under OFMC and CL-AtSe models, that means the same protocol is secure against active and passive attacks including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal cryptanalysis has been also presented, which confirmed that the proposed protocol provides well security protection on the relevant security attacks. The performance analysis section compares the proposed protocol with other existing protocols in terms of security and it has been observed that the protocol provides more security and achieves additional functionalities such as user anonymity and session key verification.",

    "abstract": "In the face of a disaster hospitals are expected to be able to continue providing efficient and high-quality care to patients. It is therefore crucial for hospitals to develop business continuity plans (BCPs) that identify their vulnerabilities, and prepare procedures to overcome them. A key aspect of most hospitals' BCPs is creating the backup of the hospital information system (HIS) data at multiple remote sites. However, the need to keep the data confidential dramatically increases the costs of making such backups. Secret sharing is a method to split an original secret message so that individual pieces are meaningless, but putting sufficient number of pieces together reveals the original message. It allows creation of pseudo-redundant arrays of independent disks for privacy-sensitive data over the Internet. We developed a secret sharing environment for StarBED, a large-scale network experiment environment, and evaluated its potential and performance during disaster recovery. Simulation results showed that the entire main HIS database of Kyoto University Hospital could be retrieved within three days even if one of the distributed storage systems crashed during a disaster.",

    "title": "Strategies for Medical Data Extraction and Presentation Part 3: Automated Context- and User-Specific Data Extraction.",
    "abstract": "In current medical practice, data extraction is limited by a number of factors including lack of information system integration, manual workflow, excessive workloads, and lack of standardized databases. The combined limitations result in clinically important data often being overlooked, which can adversely affect clinical outcomes through the introduction of medical error, diminished diagnostic confidence, excessive utilization of medical services, and delays in diagnosis and treatment planning. Current technology development is largely inflexible and static in nature, which adversely affects functionality and usage among the diverse and heterogeneous population of end users. In order to address existing limitations in medical data extraction, alternative technology development strategies need to be considered which incorporate the creation of end user profile groups (to account for occupational differences among end users), customization options (accounting for individual end user needs and preferences), and context specificity of data (taking into account both the task being performed and data subject matter). Creation of the proposed context- and user-specific data extraction and presentation templates offers a number of theoretical benefits including automation and improved workflow, completeness in data search, ability to track and verify data sources, creation of computerized decision support and learning tools, and establishment of data-driven best practice guidelines.",

On the basis of an analysis of the contents of the Catalog relative to automated functions for dietetic departments, charge capturing and diet change notification were the functions used most frequently in hospitals. Although a stores inventory was not included as a component offered by any of the responding vendors, 23 of the hospital systems described in the catalog included a stores inventory component. Menu planning and meal scheduling were functions which were both available from vendors and utilized in hospitals. The nutrient analysis function was implemented in some of the larger hospitals.

Clinicians should be able to access both systems' data in an integrated and consistent way as part of their regular working environment, whether HIS or RIS. Also, this system should allow for teleconferencing with other users, eg, for consultation with a specialist in the radiology department.

Here a problematic patient care information system (PCIS) is discussed in relation to federal and provincial policies and corporate strategies to demonstrate that our understanding of health informatics can be enhanced by linking micro studies of health informatics to larger macro contexts. Interviews and document study. Although the extent to which federal initiatives influenced (or failed to influence) provincial and hospital initiatives remains debateable, events initiated at one level (the hospital's decision to implement software, initiated at the organizational level) are influenced (perhaps indirectly) by developments in other contexts (federal/macro changes gave an initiative more weight; provincial initiatives such as the Labour Accord altered the industrial relations environment in which system development occurred). Micro-studies of work practice, invaluable in addressing interactions between technologies, users and work practices, often fail to account for the historic reach of global actors, although it is often these historic circumstances that contribute to present-day interactions between user, information system and organization, and that find expression - often indirectly - in daily work practices.",

Since the use of oncology information systems enhances the quality of care, improves documentation, optimizes resource allocation, and increases the cost-effectiveness of care services, attention to these systems' performance and their adaptation to workflows seems necessary. The purpose of this study was to identify cancer patient care workflows to design an oncology information system for Iran. This study employed a qualitative design and was conducted in 2019. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 experts to determine their views on identifying workflows for cancer patients' care. The participants were clinical and non-clinical staff at six university hospitals equipped with oncology wards. The method of data analysis was framework analysis. The cancer patient care workflows consisted of two categories, including cancer diagnosis workflows and cancer treatment workflows. Cancer diagnosis workflows fall into three subcategories, i.e., the patient's referral to the clinic, an examination of the patient's condition, and pathology workflows. On the other hand, cancer treatment workflows are divided into various treatments offered to cancer patients and workflows in the chemotherapy and radiotherapy wards. Given the variety of services and the complexity of caring for cancer patients as well as the involvement of various specialists in the process of care, identifying and optimizing workflows in the oncology information system reduces errors, enhances data accuracy, eliminates unnecessary steps, and ultimately improve the service delivery to cancer patients.",

    "title": "Comparison of two heuristic evaluation methods for evaluating the usability of health information systems.",
    "abstract": "In addition to following the usual Heuristic Evaluation (HE) method, the usability of health information systems can also be evaluated using a checklist. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of these two methods in identifying usability problems of health information systems. Eight evaluators independently evaluated different parts of a Medical Records Information System using two methods of HE (usual and with a checklist). The two methods were compared in terms of the number of problems identified, problem type, and the severity of identified problems. In all, 192 usability problems were identified by two methods in the Medical Records Information System. This was significantly higher than the number of usability problems identified by the checklist and usual method (148 and 92, respectively) (p < 0.0001). After removing the duplicates, the difference between the number of unique usability problems identified by the checklist method (n = 100) and usual method (n = 44) was significant (p < 0.0001). Differences between the mean severity of the real usability problems (1.83) and those identified by only one of the methods (usual = 2.05, checklist = 1.74) were significant (p = 0.001). This study revealed the potential of the two HE methods for identifying usability problems of health information systems. The results demonstrated that the checklist method had significantly better performance in terms of the number of identified usability problems; however, the performance of the usual method for identifying problems of higher severity was significantly better. Although the checklist method can be more efficient for less experienced evaluators, wherever usability is critical, the checklist should be used with caution in usability evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, Bhutan has made substantial progress in controlling malaria. The country is now in an elimination phase, aiming to achieve no locally transmitted malaria by 2018. However, challenges remain and innovative control strategies are needed to overcome these. The evaluation and user acceptance of a robust surveillance tool applicable for informing malaria elimination activities is reported here. The Bhutan Febrile and Malaria Information System (BFMIS) is a combination of web-based and mobile technology that captures malariometric surveillance data and generates real time reports. The system was rolled out at six sites and data uploaded regularly for analysis. Data completeness, accuracy and data turnaround time were accessed by comparison to traditional paper based surveillance records. User acceptance and willingness for further roll out was assessed using qualitative and quantitative data. Data completeness was nearly 10 % higher using the electronic system than the paper logs, and accuracy and validity of both approaches was comparable (up to 0.05 % in valid data and up to 3.06 % inaccurate data). Data turnaround time was faster using the BFMIS. General user satisfaction with the BFMIS was high, with high willingness of health facilities to adopt the system. Qualitative interviews revealed several areas for improvement before scale up. The BFMIS had numerous advantages over the paper-based system and based on the findings of the survey the Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme has taken the decision to incorporate the BMFIS and expand its use throughout all areas at risk for malaria as a key surveillance tool.",

A new health care paradigm with focus on chronic treatment and care will actualize the need for interoperable standards based services due to the complexity of care where different health levels and professions are involved. Given the complexity of the domain, we argue the need for a systematic and formal approach to the development of interoperable information systems if there shall be any real support of the cooperating actors. We describe our work on technical interoperability done in the Linkcare project addressing new models of care and technology to support them in the domain of the chronically ill using concrete results from an architecture built using the MAFIIA architecture framework and the UML 2.0 profile for software services, and argue that building formal architectural descriptions on the basis of shared interface descriptions and profiles are an important part of achieving continuity of care based on sustainable health systems.",

The synergistic understanding inherent in such an approach is illustrated by a study linking local AEM model predictions of water elevation with ground water geodatabase objects. This AEM Model Interface provides a key component in establishing a common object-oriented geodatabase modeling approach linking ground water to a variety of natural and social processes.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the rationale for designing and implementing the next-generation of public health information systems using grid computing concepts and tools. Our attempt is to evaluate all grid types including data grids for sharing information and computational grids for accessing computational resources on demand. Public health is a broad domain that requires coordinated uses of disparate and heterogeneous information systems. System interoperability in public health is limited. The next-generation public health information systems must overcome barriers to integration and interoperability, leverage advances in information technology, address emerging requirements, and meet the needs of all stakeholders. Grid-based architecture provides one potential technical solution that deserves serious consideration. Within this context, we describe three discrete public health information system problems and the process by which the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) and the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah in the United States has approached the exploration for eventual deployment of a Utah Public Health Informatics Grid. These three problems are: i) integration of internal and external data sources with analytic tools and computational resources; ii) provide external stakeholders with access to public health data and services; and, iii) access, integrate, and analyze internal data for the timely monitoring of population health status and health services. After one year of experience, we have successfully implemented federated queries across disparate administrative domains, and have identified challenges and potential solutions concerning the selection of candidate analytic grid services, data sharing concerns, security models, and strategies for reducing expertise required at a public health agency to implement a public health grid.",

    "abstract": "The advanced technology of computing system was followed by the rapid improvement of medical instrumentation and patient record management system. The typical examples are hospital information system (HIS) and picture archiving and communication system (PACS), which computerized the management procedure of medical records and images in hospital. Because these systems were built and used in hospitals, doctors out of hospital have problems to access them immediately on emergent cases. To solve these problems, this paper addressed the realization of system that could transmit the images acquired by medical imaging systems in hospital to the remote doctors' handheld PDA's using CDMA cellular phone network. The system consists of server and PDA. The server was developed to manage the accounts of doctors and patients and allocate the patient images to each doctor. The PDA was developed to display patient images through remote server connection. To authenticate the personal user, remote data access (RDA) method was used in PDA accessing the server database and file transfer protocol (FTP) was used to download patient images from the remove server. In laboratory experiments, it was calculated to take ninety seconds to transmit thirty images with 832 x 488 resolution and 24 bit depth and 0.37 Mb size. This result showed that the developed system has no problems for remote doctors to receive and review the patient images immediately on emergent cases.",

Usability is a context-dependent qualitative feature that is measured by multiple quality components that can be related to users' characteristics. This study was conducted to evaluate the usability of a comprehensive national health information system (SIB; an abbreviation for the Persian equivalent of 'integrated health system') from the perspective of different users and to determine the relationship between quality components and users' characteristics. The study population were users of the national health information system (n = 309) at health centers and health homes affiliated to Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran. Data were collected using Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) questionnaire which measures users' experiences of software interface in five quality components (i.e. affect, efficiency, helpfulness, control, and learnability) and provides a global usability score. SUMI scores were analyzed according to an extensive reference database (SUMISCO). The relationships between quality components and users' characteristics were investigated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), independent t-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. A total of 250 users completed the questionnaire (response rate = 81%). The mean scores of all quality components were significantly lower than the mean of SUMISCO. Learnability score had significant relationships with the user's position, education level, and field of education (P < 0.001). Physicians scored significantly lower than other users in efficiency, helpfulness and global usability (P < 0.05). Users' practice experience and age had significant linear inverse relationships with efficiency, helpfulness, and learnability (P < 0.05). The national health information system which is used by a large number of users across a developing country have low usability. Given the significant relationships between the users' characteristics of such systems and quality components, it is essential to consider the characteristics and needs of various user groups during the processes of system analysis and design.",

    "title": "The RaDiCo information system for rare disease cohorts.",
    "abstract": "Rare diseases (RDs) clinical care and research face several challenges. Patients are dispersed over large geographic areas, their number per disease is limited, just like the number of researchers involved. Current databases as well as biological collections, when existing, are generally local, of modest size, incomplete, of uneven quality, heterogeneous in format and content, and rarely accessible or standardised to support interoperability. Most disease phenotypes are complex corresponding to multi-systemic conditions, with insufficient interdisciplinary cooperation. Thus emerged the need to generate, within a coordinated, mutualised, secure and interoperable framework, high-quality data from national or international RD cohorts, based on deep phenotyping, including molecular analysis data, notably genotypic. The RaDiCo program objective was to create, under the umbrella of Inserm, a national operational platform dedicated to the development of RD e-cohorts. Its Information System (IS) is presented here. Constructed on the cloud computing principle, the RaDiCo platform was designed to promote mutualization and factorization of processes and services, for both clinical epidemiology support and IS. RaDiCo IS is based on an interoperability framework combining a unique RD identifier, data standardisation, FAIR principles, data exchange flows/processes and data security principles compliant with the European GDPR. RaDiCo IS favours a secure, open-source web application in order to implement and manage online databases and give patients themselves the opportunity to collect their data. It ensures a continuous monitoring of data quality and consistency over time. RaDiCo IS proved to be efficient, currently hosting 13 e-cohorts, covering 67 distinct RDs. As of April 2024, 8063 patients were recruited from 180 specialised RD sites spread across the national territory. The RaDiCo operational platform is equivalent to a national infrastructure. Its IS enables RD e-cohorts to be developed on a shared platform with no limit on size or number. Compliant with the GDPR, it is compatible with the French National Health Data Hub and can be extended to the RDs European Reference Networks (ERNs). RaDiCo provides a robust IS, compatible with the French Data Hub and RDs ERNs, integrated on a RD platform that enables e-cohorts creation, monitoring and analysis.",

    "title": "Outcomes assessment of clinical information system implementation: a practical guide.",
    "abstract": "Healthcare information systems (HIS) play a vital role in quality of care and the organization's daily operations. Consequently, increasing numbers of clinicians have been involved in HIS implementation, particularly for clinical information systems (CIS). Implementation of these systems is a major organizational investment, and its outcomes must be assessed. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians and frontline informaticians with a practical guide to assess these outcomes, focusing on outcome variables, assessment methods, and timing of assessment. Based on in-depth literature reviews and their empirical experiences, the authors identified 3 frequently used outcomes: user satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and financial impact. These outcomes have been assessed employing various methods, including randomized controlled trials, pre- and post-test studies, time and motion studies, surveys, and user testing. The timing for outcomes assessments varied depending on several factors, such as learning curves or patients conditions. In conclusion, outcomes assessment is essential for the success of healthcare information technology, and the CIS implementation team members must be prepared to conduct and/or facilitate these studies.",

Using qualitative techniques, we performed a task analysis of the activities associated with notifiable conditions reporting at a large urban health department. We identified seventeen primary tasks associated with the use of the department's information system. The results of this investigation suggest that communicable disease information management takes place in a dynamic environment where changing needs may require new solutions for system users. Additionally, our work suggests that task analysis, when applied to document the use of a legacy information system, can provide local public health agencies with valuable information about their information management needs, and can become a part of their information management decision-making strategy.",

One way to do this is to organize a hospital's human resources to facilitate participatory management in the CIS selection process. With our proposed cross-section of hospital staff, all of whom use the same evaluation methodology, the hospital will select a system which addresses defined information needs. Our experience has shown time and again that with careful planning and user participation, a hospital can be confident that the CIS it selects is \"best.\" This process, used successfully in a number of hospitals, will improve the accuracy and timeliness of information flow throughout the hospital while providing a higher level of quality patient care and, concurrently, providing a comprehensive reporting system to control costs and enhance the financial operation of the hospital.",

    "abstract": "In order to access remote medical server, generally the patients utilize smart card to login to the server. It has been observed that most of the user (patient) authentication protocols suffer from smart card stolen attack that means the attacker can mount several common attacks after extracting smart card information. Recently, Lu et al.'s proposes a session key agreement protocol between the patient and remote medical server and claims that the same protocol is secure against relevant security attacks. However, this paper presents several security attacks on Lu et al.'s protocol such as identity trace attack, new smart card issue attack, patient impersonation attack and medical server impersonation attack. In order to fix the mentioned security pitfalls including smart card stolen attack, this paper proposes an efficient remote mutual authentication protocol using smart card. We have then simulated the proposed protocol using widely-accepted AVISPA simulation tool whose results make certain that the same protocol is secure against active and passive attacks including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the rigorous security analysis proves that the proposed protocol provides strong security protection on the relevant security attacks including smart card stolen attack. We compare the proposed scheme with several related schemes in terms of computation cost and communication cost as well as security functionalities. It has been observed that the proposed scheme is comparatively better than related existing schemes.",

The challenge is allowing knowledge transfer to hospital staff while still ensuring compliance with security mandates. Working in collaboration with a private hospital in Turkey; this study aims to reveal the essential elements of a 21st century business continuity plan for hospitals while presenting the security vulnerabilities in the current hospital information systems and personal privacy auditing standards proposed by regulations and laws. We will survey the accreditation criteria in Turkey and counterparts in US and EU. We will also interview with medical staff in the hospital to understand the needs for personal privacy and the technical staff to perceive the technical requirements in terms of network security configuration and deployment. As hospitals are adopting electronic transactions, it should be considered a must to protect these electronic health records in terms of personal privacy aspects.",

Additional programs can be used for billing, displaying the use of (operating room OR) facilities by the various surgical divisions, and showing the actual stage of on-line operations with monitors. The software system MUMPS has been found to be a low-priced yet efficient and versatile multiuser system. The main features of the program are ease of use, prospective data entry (i.e. during the entire stay of the patient), and the possibility of modifying and expanding the system easily. Missing or inaccurate data are automatically brought to the attention of those who have performed the operation or the anesthesia by a program that is run periodically. The system has been found to be a useful tool for the daily scheduling of the OR program. It provides data for better scheduling of personnel and records can also be kept regarding the professional experience of physicians. The major deficiency of the program at this stage is its lack of a hierarchical structure. For example, it is unable to record multiple operations and/or anesthetic procedures for the same patient. This deficiency will be corrected in a newer version of the program.",

In 2018, four districts did not exceed 1% completeness of community reports. Some concerns remain related to a need of local support and inter-sectoral collaboration. The technical and organizational factors affect process and performance of the system directly or indirectly through behavioral determinants. the ability to measure the performance of all health facilities and to share all community reports online are challenges for the health system in Burkina Faso.

The third was a naturalistic quasi-experimental field study that collected data unobtrusively from more than 1200 TravTek rental car drivers with no in-vehicle experimenter. The results suggest that with increased experience, drivers become familiar with the system and develop strategies for substantially more efficient and safer use. The results also showed that drivers over age 65 had difficulty driving and navigating concurrently. They compensated by driving slowly and more cautiously. Despite this increased caution, older drivers made more safety-related errors than did younger drivers. The results also showed that older drivers benefited substantially from a well-designed ATIS driver interface.",

    "abstract": "Ordinary passive surveillance (generally spontaneous reporting) of adverse effects of medical products is not enough to manage medical risks/safety. The Japanese government, following the \"sentinel initiative\" by the US government, started the \"Japanese sentinel project\" as an active surveillance of medical products with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency(PMDA). Using entire prescription data in the hospital information system, data on laboratory examinations, diagnosis, and therapy specific to an adverse effect are checked by detecting differences between before and after prescription of a specific medical product to extract adverse effects and calculate their correct frequency in the surveillance. The project uses standard masters and protocols to analyze data among medial institutes by installation of the SS-MIX standard storage system. Ten hospitals were selected in 2011 to join the project, and the entire system and network will be implemented in those hospitals and PMDA until 2013 fiscal year. JLAC10 is used in the project as the laboratory examination code of the Japanese Society of Laboratory Medicine. Many incorrect coding and ambiguous coding rules were found by voluntary surveillance of 6 of the 10 hospitals in the project. Thus, the Council on Standardized Master Operation of Clinical Laboratory Examinations will launch in 2013 to improve and maintain JLAC10, which is essential not only for the Japanese sentinel project but also for data utilization by many other projects.",

The methodology is contrasted against the Enterprise Electronic Medical Record (EEMR) model for usability, efficiency, and adaptability. The methodology was tested in a Breast Cancer setting where the CIS went through 4 rapid agile stages. Time and motion statistics, training times, system changes, and user feedback data was collected for assessment. The results showed that the Breast CIS increased time efficiency by 30% in the first 3 months of implementation. Users reported high usability and trainability of the system. Over 95% of system design change requests were satisfied with an average turn-around time of 3 days. The results show that systems designed under a CTLD approach, accompanied by Immediately Adaptable system architecture, provide greater efficiency for staff in clinical settings while enabling the workflow processes to be adapted dynamically as part of continuous process improvement.",

A well-designed LTC information system should therefore consider the information requirements of multidisciplinary health care providers to adequately support their care services. This study proposed a modified service blueprint-the PSD service blueprint-for visualizing interdisciplinary service providers' input and output information requirements, which correspond to their service activities. The PSD service blueprint comprises five layers and seven elements. We also present a case study to illustrate the blueprint's application to daily LTC services. Our proposed approach could clearly illustrate the daily care activities, service providers (main actors), actors' input and output information, and suggestions for LTC information system-related applications. The proposed PSD service blueprint can not only gather interdisciplinary LTC service providers' information system requirements but also act as a mapping tool for visualizing the care service process.",

Coverage was calculated as the number of deaths recorded in SIM divided by the total (SIM + active search). The study showed 94.8% coverage and detected an important contribution by notary public offices to the identification of deaths that were missing from the SIM. Of these unreported deaths, 29.7% occurred in health services, 49% occurred at home with death certificates signed by private physicians, and 25.5% had been attested by the forensic examiner's office. The method allowed calculating the coverage rate for the Mortality Information System in a municipality in the metropolitan area.

    "abstract": "Strengthening nutrition routine information system is critical to support nutrition programs with relevant data to inform decision-making. This study analyzed the practices and lessons learned from the implementation in Burkina Faso in strengthening nutrition routine data using institutionalized health management information systems for decision making.Methods This qualitative study was conducted in Burkina Faso in 2022 on the capitalization of best practices after 3 years of implementation through documentary review, semi-structured individual interviews with 64 key implementing informants spread over 2 health districts, 2 regional hospital centers and 2 health regions, and a national triangulation workshop with 40 implementing actors, including 20 from the central level, 15 from the decentralized level, and 5 partners.Results The results of the study show the best practices and progress identified: (i) the integration of new routine data elements and nutrition indicators into District Health Information Software (DHIS2), which filled the data gap for adequate monitoring of the nutrition program; (ii) the design and use of the nutrition indicator dashboard; (iii) data validation and performance review sessions which have improved the quality and use of routine data in decision-making; and (iv) decentralization of data entry of monthly activity reports of health facilities. Lessons learned included: (i) conducting a small-scale phase to test the indicators is an important step to take before national scale-up of the indicators; (ii) a participatory approach involving all actors at different levels is important; (iii) advocacy is important to integrate prevention indicators into health facilities information systems in a more curative-oriented health system; (iv) the decentralized entry of data is a best practice that improves data quality in terms of timeliness, completeness, and internal consistency.Conclusion Beyond the inclusion of indicators, special emphasis should be placed on working on data quality. Future experiences in refining routine data related to nutrition-sensitive interventions in the non-health sectors are key next steps that would further contribute to strengthening the national nutrition information system.",

This paper deals with the consequences for the management of hospital information systems if health professional workstations are introduced as a means for this information logistic and with the experiences gained in the Heidelberg University Hospital. Health professional workstations are formally defined in the context of a three level graph-based model of hospital information systems. It is found that health professional workstations have communication needs not only on the physical level of computer systems in the hospital information system but also on the logical tool level, which is the level of application systems. On this level communication servers or brokers are of considerable importance. In Heidelberg there are about 200 health professional workstations (MEDIAS) in routine use.",

The goal was to determine the agreement between the variables of the TCC-Québec Information System identified by experts and based on an extensive literature review and those found in medical records. The medical records of 82 adults with a head injury were reviewed. The individuals had been hospitalized from 1997 to 1998 at three different acute care facilities or three rehabilitation centers. The abstractor determined if the information pertaining to a variable (e.g. personal history, impairments, or disabilities relating to sensori-motor function) was present in the record. A standardized and reliable procedure was used to ensure the quality of data extraction. The percentage of variables found in the medical records and the number of records in which each variable was documented were calculated for each clinical setting (acute care or rehabilitation) and for the different geographical regions. The results suggest that a large discrepancy exists between what experts desired to be included in the information system and what is really documented clinically. No discrepancy exists between the different regions. Only 23% of variables were found in more than 70% of records. This study provides recommendations about the most relevant variables to be included in an information system based on clinicians'information needs and the clinical reality. As such, these results should facilitate the use and implementation of the information system under study.",

SAKURA-Viewer is based on a concept hierarchy method and focuses the view of consolidated information. This viewer represents order history from two viewpoints simultaneously to eliminate semantic redundancies. FUJI-Viewer is based on two-dimensional mapping method and focuses the flow of periodic information. This viewer represents differences between the plan history and the order history to manage a long-term test order history and test plan history concurrently. These viewers also support data entry methods that input order-related data efficiently and accurately. This interface reduces the workload of the medical stuff. These intelligent viewers are incorporated into a clinical information system.",

    "title": "Digital imaging and electronic patient records in pathology using an integrated department information system with PACS.",
    "abstract": "Picture archiving and communication systems have been widely used in radiology thus far. Owing to the progress made in digital photo technology, their use in medicine opens up further opportunities. In the field of pathology, digital imaging offers new possiblities for the documentation of macroscopic and microscopic findings. Digital imaging has the advantage that the data is permanently and readily available, independent of conventional archives. In the past, PACS was a separate entity. Meanwhile, however, PACS has been integrated in DIS, the department information system, which was also run separately in former times. The combination of these two systems makes the administration of patient data, findings and images easier. Moreover, thanks to the introduction of special communication standards, a data exchange between different department information systems and hospital information systems (HIS) is possible. This provides the basis for a communication platform in medicine, constituting an electronic patient record (EPR) that permits an interdisciplinary treatment of patients by providing data of findings and images from clinics treating the same patient. As the pathologic diagnosis represents a central and often therapy-determining component, it is of utmost importance to add pathologic diagnoses to the EPR. Furthermore, the pathologist's work is considerably facilitated when he is able to retrieve additional data from the patient file. In this article, we describe our experience gained with the combined PACS and DIS systems recently installed at the Department of Pathology, University of Magdeburg. Moreover, we evaluate the current situation and future prospects for PACS in pathology.",

    "abstract": "When healthcare organizations merge, their goal often is to improve operational efficiencies, with information systems (IS) a common target for cost reduction. These cost reductions usually are achieved by reducing staff, consolidating data centers, establishing standardized systems, and sharing resources throughout the system. During this process, however, several common pitfalls can cause merging organizations to stumble. By carefully evaluating their options, merging organizations can avoid these potential traps and reduce their IS costs.",

    "title": "Systemic factors of errors in the case identification process of the national routine health information system: a case study of Modified Field Health Services Information System in the Philippines.",
    "abstract": "The quality of data in national health information systems has been questionable in most developing countries. However, the mechanisms of errors in the case identification process are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of errors in the case identification process in the existing routine health information system (RHIS) in the Philippines by measuring the risk of committing errors for health program indicators used in the Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS 1996), and characterizing those indicators accordingly. A structured questionnaire on the definitions of 12 selected indicators in the FHSIS was administered to 132 health workers in 14 selected municipalities in the province of Palawan. A proportion of correct answers (difficulty index) and a disparity of two proportions of correct answers between higher and lower scored groups (discrimination index) were calculated, and the patterns of wrong answers for each of the 12 items were abstracted from 113 valid responses. None of 12 items reached a difficulty index of 1.00. The average difficulty index of 12 items was 0.266 and the discrimination index that showed a significant difference was 0.216 and above. Compared with these two cut-offs, six items showed non-discrimination against lower difficulty indices of 0.035 (4/113) to 0.195 (22/113), two items showed a positive discrimination against lower difficulty indices of 0.142 (16/113) and 0.248 (28/113), and four items showed a positive discrimination against higher difficulty indices of 0.469 (53/113) to 0.673 (76/113). The results suggest three characteristics of definitions of indicators such as those that are (1) unsupported by the current conditions in the health system, i.e., (a) data are required from a facility that cannot directly generate the data and, (b) definitions of indicators are not consistent with its corresponding program; (2) incomplete or ambiguous, which allow several interpretations; and (3) complete yet easily misunderstood by health workers.Taking systemic factors into account, the case identification step needs to be reviewed and designed to generate intended data in health information systems.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare is an information-intensive field, as information is needed to make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. The purpose of this study was to identify the tactical decisions that middle management healthcare managers make, the information that is available, and the necessary information that is missing using the cardiac care process as an example. Data were collected through focused interviews of nurses and physicians who work in middle management in a secondary healthcare field. The interviews were coded and analyzed using the thematic content analysis method. We identified two main categories of tactical decisions: those concerning the process of care and those concerning the resources for the care. We termed the categories \"process decisions\" and \"resource decisions.\" The availability of information varied. Much of the necessary information was created and processed manually. Our results show that the collection, mining, and systematic use of information are difficult because of the existence of many types of information systems and their varying abilities to produce and report information. Finally, much of the important information is missing. In conclusion, the information management process in healthcare settings needs to be improved, and a new generation of information system is needed to support tactical decision making in middle management.",

    "abstract": "A field-based evaluation is conducted of a Clinical Computerized Information System (CCIS). Following training, the use of the CCIS database, word processing and other programs by thirteen full-time practicing emergency physicians in two urban emergency departments of a University-associated teaching hospital was studied over a one-year period. A tracking program automatically logged frequency and duration of use by the physicians, and user satisfaction was assessed by a reliable and validated questionnaire instrument. Based on utilization data and verbal reports of these physicians, CCIS database searching was not only found to be easy-to-learn but was readily accessible during emergency shifts. Individual physicians were found to perform an average of 3.5 searches per month lasting a mean search time of 8 min. Positive notes about the CCIS system included ease-of-use, accuracy of data, accessibility of system, and value of output while negative perceptions included a lack of integration with other systems, a lack of system completeness, and a high subscription cost. It was suggested that a less costly telephone link to a high-volume Centre would be desirable in actual implementation of the system.",

There are several existing DUE information systems that have some capacity to evaluate the quality of prescribing in specific populations (e.g., veterans, public and private insured groups, hospital service areas). Shortcomings of most DUE information systems include patient identification problems, defects in database design, and lack of software to identify prescribing problems and perform statistical analysis.

We found that the direct financial benefits are modest but the indirect and intangible benefits are large. Benefits of time savings and access to data particularly accrued to pathologists and residents (3.8 h/d saved for 26 pathologists and residents). Integrating the scanned document management system (SDMS) into the AP-LIS has major advantages in terms of workflow and overall simplicity. This simple, integrated SDMS is an excellent value in a practice like ours, and many of the benefits likely apply in other practice settings.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, it is proposed \"Firmly implement the rural revitalization strategy\", and rural revitalization has risen to the level of national-level strategy. Human geography is to respond to the cultural effects produced by various residents with similar living habits together. As a spatial science, GIS, with its unique spatial viewpoint and spatial thinking, reveals the spatial distribution characteristics and dynamic change laws of various things and phenomena from spatial interconnections and interactions. From the spatial objects studied by GIS, this paper puts forward thoughts on the new directions of GIS development: expanding from Earth space to cosmic space, it is necessary to build coordinate system and cosmic geospatial information system, lunar geospatial information system, etc.; extending from outdoor space to indoor space, it is necessary to develop indoor geospatial information system and expand to underwater space and underground space; from macro to micro space, we can develop sports geospatial information system for games, human geospatial information system for life and health management, etc.; facing the era of big data, we can develop theories and methods of spatial analysis of big data and contribute to the development of big data science. Thus, the way of constructing GIS based on human geospatial analysis can be built in the context of the era of rural revitalization. The purpose of the research in this paper is mainly to show the role of GIS in the construction of human geography space. Through GIS means, it can better gather some villages in human geography, have a better form of expression, and can better construct a spatial information system.",

    "abstract": "In the context of \"internet + medical health\" and emphasis on evaluation mechanism for medical and health talents in China, we design an evaluation index system for doctors on online medical platforms by synthesizing two patterns of existing online medical platforms, which is the first step to enhance the capabilities of doctors on online medical platforms. Based on the doctor evaluation model integrating information systems success model (ISS-DE model) and grounded theory, the evaluation indicators were obtained through expert interviews, offline medical institutions investigation, online platforms investigation, and literature research, and were assigned weights using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. A working group composed of 23 experts was set up to review and determine the competency standards of doctors on the online medical platforms. A new indicator framework covering 3 dimensions of system quality, service quality and information quality was constructed in this study. The index system included 3 first-level indicators, 8 s-level indicators and 60 third-level indicators, and each indicator was given different weightage. The complete index system constructed by the Delphi method in this study is suitable for China's online medical platforms, which will help to improve the quality of platforms and the ability of doctors, thus promoting the process of internet medical integration.",

Founded in 1974, it has grown to include more than 16 centers, 22,000 patients, 140,000 patient encounters, and 80,000,000 observations. Traditionally, data storage and computer programs have resided on the IBM \"2\"-370 system at Stanford University. Distant peripheral centers have entered and retrieved data and performed analyses using proprietary long distance telephone networks. With growth, ARAMIS has placed strong emphasis on data quality and epidemiological soundness. \"Core\" groups at Stanford specifically address issues of quality control, biostatistics, health care economics, outcome assessment, study design, and administration. Advances in microcomputers and software has led ARAMIS to begin a migration from mainframe computing to distributed systems using IBM PC/XT/AT type computers and the Medlog software system. Substantial cost savings have been noted with distributed processing. The ability to easily transfer data and software forms a groundwork for international data banks and data exchange, but common vocabulary and common quality control procedures are essential for effective international cooperation and exchange.",

We aim to discuss how the Brazilian National Health Information Systems can help to assess the impact of the ZIKV epidemic on health outcomes potentially related to ZIKV. Health outcomes potentially related to ZIKV infection were described based on a literature review of published studies on ZIKV infection outcomes and on recent protocols developed and published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health for different stages of the life cycle. These outcomes were correlated with the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system, as this is the diagnostic classification registered in the Health Information System. A suggested list of 50 clinical manifestations, dispersed into 4 ICD chapters, and their information sources was created to help monitor the ZIKV epidemics and trends. Correlation of these selected ICD-10 codes and the HIS, as well as, a review of the potentialities and limitations of health information systems were performed. The potential of the Health Information System and its underutilization by stakeholders and researchers have been a barrier in diagnosing and reporting ZIKV infection and its complications. The ZIKV outbreak is still a challenge for health practice and the Brazilian Health Information System.",

In this paper, we examine solutions to address semantic heterogeneity for a complex organ transplantation information system. The information system that has been developed by the French agency for transplantation (EfG) has to gather medical information concerning patients and donors for organ allocation, epidemiological studies, and public health decisions. We analyze in this context the limits of the traditional approach based on a standard vocabulary and a relational database for the transplantation domain. We present its evolution towards a system that combines a terminology server and a data warehouse. The perspective is now to build a formal ontology that may support semantic integration in an advanced transplantation information system. Two open issues in formal ontology design are discussed. First, providing definitions of all medical concepts is not an obvious task if we want those definitions be meaningful, formal, and compatible with other ontologies. Second, propagation of properties along relations raises the needs for extending description logics with rules.",

The Integrated Care Coordination Information System (ICCIS) was iteratively developed with user input to meet these needs. Following 16 months of system use, ICCIS users and developers were interviewed about their experiences. These interviews, along with quantitative information about system use, were analyzed using a combination of Linstone's Multiple Perspective approach and the ABC framework to determine lessons learned about novel system creation. Overall, clinicians saw value in specialized health information technology (HIT) tools for care coordination as long as development focuses on providing user-requested functionality that integrates closely with existing HIT systems and workflows. Close integration between novel HIT and EHRs may increase use by relieving the cited fatigues of duplicative data entry, multiple system logins, and potential data inconsistencies.",

    "abstract": "A service information system using the Internet, which connected the various people who are related to medical treatment and nursing welfare, was constructed. An intractable neurological disease patient who lives in the Onga district, Fukuoka, Japan, and the people who are related to the service were chosen as test users in an experimental model. The communicated service information was divided into open-use data (electronic bulletin board, welfare service, medical care service, and link to private company service home page) and closed-use data (the individual patient's hysterics). The open data server was installed in an Internet service provider The open data could be accessed not only by the patient, but also by the family, information center, companies, hospitals, and nursing commodity store related to patient's nursing and medical treatment. Closed data server was installed in an information center (public health center). Only patient and information center staff can access the closed data. Patients should search and collect the service information of various medical and welfare services by themselves. Therefore, services prepared for the patient are difficult to know, and they cannot be sufficiently utilized. With the use of this information system, all usable service information became accessible, and patients could easily use it. The electronic bulletin board system (BBS) was used by patients for knowing each other or each others' family, and was used as a device for exchange of wisdom. Also, the questions for the specialist, such as doctor, dentist, teacher, physical therapist, care manager, welfare office staff member, and public health nurse, and the answers were shown on the BBS. By arranging data file, a reference of various patients in question and answer, which appeared in this BBS, was made as \"advisory hints\" and was added to the open data. The advisory hints became the new service information for the patients and their family. This BBS discovered the possibility of becoming an important information source for companies, hospital and, administration to know the requirements of patients and their families and the kind of services to be served. Although suppliers provide medical and welfare services for the patient, there is a tendency that the service information is sent by the suppliers at their own convenience. The information system in which various people participated was constructed in order to collect information for the patient, taking a patient-oriented approach. The result of the model test showed that this information system using Internet technology is a good system for both the service supplier and its receiver.",

    "abstract": "In 2006, we were funded by the US National Institutes of Health to implement a study of tuberculosis epidemiology in Peru. The study required a secure information system to manage data from a target goal of 16,000 subjects who needed to be followed for at least one year. With previous experience in the development and deployment of web-based medical record systems for TB treatment in Peru, we chose to use the OpenMRS open source electronic medical record system platform to develop the study information system. Supported by a core technical and management team and a large and growing worldwide community, OpenMRS is now being used in more than 40 developing countries. We adapted the OpenMRS platform to better support foreign languages. We added a new module to support double data entry, linkage to an existing laboratory information system, automatic upload of GPS data from handheld devices, and better security and auditing of data changes. We added new reports for study managers, and developed data extraction tools for research staff and statisticians. Further adaptation to handle direct entry of laboratory data occurred after the study was launched. Data collection in the OpenMRS system began in September 2009. By August 2011 a total of 9,256 participants had been enrolled, 102,274 forms and 13,829 laboratory results had been entered, and there were 208 users. The system is now entirely supported by the Peruvian study staff and programmers. The information system served the study objectives well despite requiring some significant adaptations mid-stream. OpenMRS has more tools and capabilities than it did in 2008, and requires less adaptations for future projects. OpenMRS can be an effective research data system in resource poor environments, especially for organizations using or considering it for clinical care as well as research.",

Not only should they pay attention to the efficiency and effectiveness of the MSWM system, but also take account of social welfare resulting in public engagement. This study introduces three important factors including number of waste stations, maximum allowed walking distance and container capacity devoted to each station having effect on the performance of waste storage service. To investigate how these variables affect the performance of WSS, geographical information system (GIS) and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied. First, according to these three variables, fifteen experiments were designed by Box Behnken Design (BBD), then, all the experiments were modeled by maximized capacitated coverage (MCC) in GIS environment, and the parameters evaluating the performance of WSS were measured. The final response was achieved through integration of effective parameters by two different MADM methods, TOPSIS and OWA. The results showed negative effects of the number of stations and container capacity of each station on the final response, whereas increase in the maximum allowed walking distance improved the performance of WSS.",

    "title": "Progress in immunization information systems --- United States, 2009.",
    "abstract": "An immunization information system (IIS) is a confidential, computerized, population-based system that collects and consolidates vaccination data from vaccine providers and provides tools for designing and sustaining effective immunization strategies at the provider and program levels. Among the capabilities of an IIS are the capacity to inform vaccine providers of upcoming patient vaccination needs; generate vaccination coverage reports, patient reminders, or recalls for past due vaccinations; and interoperate with electronic health record (EHR) systems. In 2010, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommended that immunization information systems be used to increase vaccination coverage after showing strong evidence of their effectiveness. A Healthy People 2020 objective is to increase to 95% the percentage of children aged <6 years whose immunization records are housed in a fully operational IIS. To assess IIS progress toward meeting the Healthy People objective, CDC analyzed data from the 2009 Immunization Information Systems Annual Report (IISAR) survey (completed by 53 of 56 federal grantees with IIS sites), which indicated that 77% of all U.S. children aged <6 years participated in an IIS, an increase from 75% in 2008. In addition, 59% of grantees reported being able to send and receive vaccination data using Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging standards, and 73% reported that some vaccine providers with EHR systems in their geographic area were providing vaccination data directly to an IIS from EHRs. Enhancing IIS and EHR with standards such as HL7 will provide greater consistency in data exchange and likely help to improve the quality and timeliness of IIS data.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the use of reliable evidence for health decision-making among low-and middle-income countries. Ghana has deployed DHIMS2 to replace the previously existing manual data harmonization processes. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 districts comprising 12 district directorates, 10 district hospitals, 29 sub-district health centers, and 38 community health facilities in the Brong-Ahafo Region. Data collection tools were developed based on the Measure Evaluate assessment tools designed for evaluating the performance of routine information systems management tools. Utilization was assessed based on documented evidence and data was analyzed using STATA version 14. Although 93% of the health facilities studied submitted data unto the DHIMS2 platform, evidence suggested low use of this data in decision-making, particularly at the community level facilities where only 26% of the facilities used data from DHIMS2 to inform annual action plans and even less than 20% examined findings and issued directives for action. At the district level, 58% issued directives based on DHIMS2 information, 50% used DHIMS2 information for Advocacy purposes and 58% gave feedback reports based on DHIMS2 data for action. Functional computers were lacking across all facilities. Activities relating to the use of DHIMS2 information skew towards data quality checking with less focus on examining findings, making comparisons, and taking action-based decisions from findings and comparisons. Improving factors like internet access, availability of functional ICTs, frequency of supervisory visits, staff training and the provision of training manuals may facilitate the use of DHIMS2 in decision-making at all levels of the district health system.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring systems are useful epidemiological instruments for assessing the problem of drug abuse. The rapid growth of the drug dependence problem in Malaysia led to increased awareness of the need for a system for continuous monitoring of the situation. Preliminary work on the design of an appropriate monitoring system was initiated in 1976. A fully integrated national reporting system was established in 1978, linking all public services and agencies coming into contact with drug-dependent persons, including law enforcement agencies, drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation centres, and social and welfare institutions. The information system included a mechanism for systematic gathering, processing, analysing and presenting essential data on the prevention, control and management of drug abuse problems. It also included reporting on drug-related events, such as hospitalizations and arrests, as well as data on known drug-dependent persons and new cases of dependence. The system has been used for routine monitoring of the extent, trends, patterns and other characteristics of drug abuse problems in Malaysia, providing basic information for policy-making and programme planning. On the basis of data generated by the system, it was estimated that the prevalence rate of drug-dependent persons per 100,000 population increased from 84.3 in 1976 to 754.6 in 1986. It was estimated that there were 119,001 drug-dependent persons in Malaysia in 1986.",

PAS-MAP was compared to a manual system for collecting data not contained on the face sheets of medical records. The results indicated that, compared to the manual system, PAS-MAP: was less costly if more than 41 per cent of hospitalized patients were included in medical care evaluation studies; was as timely as the manual system for data it could provide but provided fewer clinical data elements than physicians requested; and was less protective against human error. Three decision makers assigned weights indicating the relative importance of these results. The weights were combined in an additive model to arrive at a score for each system. Based on these scores, the manual system was recommended for implementation.",

Study conducted in the state of Rio de Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, between 2003 and 2004. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to municipal managers, containing 11 single-choice questions, three multiple-choice questions and three open questions on the structure available, use of information, indicators valued and satisfaction with the systems. The questionnaire was answered by managers in 127 of the municipalities in this state with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants (37.7%). The responses were tabulated in an electronic spreadsheet and the differences between respondent and non-respondent municipalities were evaluated using the chi-square test, taking the significance level to be p < 0.05. All the municipalities had computers available (mean of three per municipality) and 94% had internet access. The personnel responsible for information system inputs and analysis were public employees (59%) who also performed other tasks. The systems most used related to budget control and transfer of funds. Data analysis and generation of information used in local planning was carried out in 59.1% of the municipalities. The indicators cited as important for local planning were the same ones used in arrangements agreed with the state, but there was difficulty in understanding the terms \"indicators\" and \"statistical data\". Only 4.7% were fully satisfied with the information obtained from the health information systems. Two realities coexisted: municipalities that perceived that inputs to health information systems were a task to be complied with because of orders from central levels, in contrast with municipalities that saw the potential for these systems but had difficulty in using them.",

In such remote environments, medical providers have traditionally had limited access to medical information, a situation quite analogous to that in remote areas of underdeveloped or developing countries. BMIST provides an all-in-one suite of mobile applications that empowers providers via access to critical medical information and powerful clinical decision support tools to accurately create an electronic health record (EHR). This record is synchronized with Department of Defense (DOD) joint health surveillance and medical information systems from the earliest echelons of care through chronic care provided by the Veterans Administration. Specific goals met in the initial phase were: integration of the PDA and wireless interface; development of the local application and user interface; development of a communications infrastructure and development of a data storage and retrieval system. The system had been used extensively in the field to create an EHR far forward that supports a longitudinal medical record across time and across all elements of the Military Healthcare System.",

The health data base is an exhaustive register of sick leave, accidents, permanent disabilities, compensated diseases, causes of death and cancer incidence among active workers. The Occupational Exposure and Working Conditions data base includes the MATEX job-exposure matrix (30 potentially carcinogenic agents) and FINDEX files which record data obtained from the systematic individual surveillance of workers. The GAZEL cohort data base concerns a sample of more than 20,000 volunteer workers, followed since 1989; in addition to data from the data bases, it contains information collected from other different sources, including self-questionnaires. Numerous epidemiological studies based on SI-EPI data have been conducted by in-house epidemiologists as well as by external research groups.

In our academic FHC (Family Health Center) we have developed software that runs on a palmtop computer allowing access to information in the HIS (Hospital Information System) and our FHC's AAMRS (Automated Ambulatory Medical Record System). The resident physicians who staff the hospital and the FHC are frequently at home or otherwise off-site where terminal access is not available. Using a Hewlett-Packard 95LX palmtop computer as the base platform, custom software has been developed to access summary data on in-patients and out-patients. Data is downloaded into a database on a palmtop computer memory card. ASCII data from Medical Information Systems (MIS), is transformed into a database format readable on the palmtop. Our hospital MIS department transmits information daily on our in-patient service (20-30 patients). We also download, weekly, a patient summary on all of our active out-patients in our MUMPS-based AAMRS (2500-3000 patients). Each morning the resident in the Family Practice program updates his palmtop memory card at a central workstation. Palmtop computers with downloaded databases, can be valuable in care of patients when the physical or on-line chart is not easily accessible. They are particularly useful in multi-physician groups when the on-call physician provides care for the patients of other physicians. We have made the palmtop computer even more valuable to physicians by providing an integrated software package.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We analyzed the deaths recorded in the Mortality Information System (SIM) in 2006 and all reports of TB in Brazil during the 2001 to 2006 period. The variables used for the relationship were: report number, city and State of residence, patient name, date and year of birth, sex, mother's name and address. Six blocking steps were performed. Scores above 12.4 were considered pairs, and those below 9.7, doubtful pairs. After each step, we performed a manual review of doubtful pairs. The Reportable Disease Information System (Sinan) had 547,589 records. The SIM had 6,924 records, 39.3% (n = 2,727) of which were not found in Sinan during the period evaluated. We observed that 64.5% (2,707) of deaths were reported in 2006 and after analyzing the proportion of deaths underreported by region and federal units, we found that the highest percentage was in the Northern region, followed by the Southeast and Northeast. The addition of deaths that had not been reported to the Sinan database increased the reporting rate 3.7%. Regarding the proportion of deaths due to TB, such inclusion was responsible for a 60.7% increase in this indicator. The relationship between both databases seems to be an important strategy for improving the quality of the TB surveillance system.",

    "abstract": "A universal healthcare coverage program has been implemented in Thailand since 2001 and the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is restructuring its health information systems to support the management of this reform. The MOPH believes that health information technology (IT) is fundamental to the development of an effective health information system, and that users' adoption of health IT is one of the most important factors to the success of health IT implementation projects. However, there is no national data available regarding the penetration and adoption of health IT in Thai community health centers (CHCs). This cross sectional survey was designed to study the penetration and adoption of health IT in the country's community health centers. A random sample of 1,607 regionally stratified CHC's from a total of 9,806 CHCs was selected. With an 82% response rate, the data showed that people who worked in CHCs were currently heavy users of health IT. They exhibited high IT acceptance and positive attitudes toward using health IT. CHCs' staff was less resistant to adopt health IT than previously anticipated. These results are similar in all of the country's geographic regions. Health IT is pervasive in CHCs across the country and penetrates all regions.",

    "title": "A Secure and Robust User Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Hierarchical Multi-medical Server Environment in TMIS.",
    "abstract": "The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) helps the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and access medical services over the Internet of mobile networks. Recently, Amin and Biswas presented a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for TMIS system using the cryptographic one-way hash function and biohashing function, and claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. Though their scheme is efficient due to usage of one-way hash function, we show that their scheme has several security pitfalls and design flaws, such as (1) it fails to protect privileged-insider attack, (2) it fails to protect strong replay attack, (3) it fails to protect strong man-in-the-middle attack, (4) it has design flaw in user registration phase, (5) it has design flaw in login phase, (6) it has design flaw in password change phase, (7) it lacks of supporting biometric update phase, and (8) it has flaws in formal security analysis. In order to withstand these security pitfalls and design flaws, we aim to propose a secure and robust user authenticated key agreement scheme for the hierarchical multi-server environment suitable in TMIS using the cryptographic one-way hash function and fuzzy extractor. Through the rigorous security analysis including the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, the formal security analysis under the random oracle model and the informal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The simulation results show that our scheme is also secure. Our scheme is more efficient in computation and communication as compared to Amin-Biswas's scheme and other related schemes. In addition, our scheme supports extra functionality features as compared to other related schemes. As a result, our scheme is very appropriate for practical applications in TMIS.",

The variables referred to birth defects (presence and system affected), type of health service, mothers, gestations, live births, and deliveries. Prevalence of birth defects was 83/10,000 live births. The most frequent birth defects involved the musculoskeletal system, central nervous system, cleft lip and palate, and chromosomal anomalies. The majority of cases were born in public (municipal) and private maternity hospitals, with the highest prevalence in the Fernandes Figueira Insitute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. Older women and those with less schooling had more live born infants with birth defects. The proportion of reports with missing information was high, reaching 21% in some institutions. Wider dissemination of SINASC data on birth defects should be encouraged. Reliability studies are recommended for better use of these reports.",

Objects of the static schema lead to a relational model. Events expose various states of Information System; operations allow one to build a dynamic schema. Such a schema is interesting for IS description in order to enhance the analytical capability of the designer, to define IS solutions and to limit the risks of errors. It allows the clinician better management of information relative to patients, especially thanks to the dynamical schema which enables one at any moment to know the patient's state. Finally, it has to free clinicians from managing information and allow them to give an always more important consideration to human relationships in medicine.",

Cost and saving trends of the project were calculated using different tools including project expense, cost saving through cessation of printing radiology films and paper. Net present value with payback period was utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the health information systems. Qualitative improvements in different healthcare functions were also analyzed. The total saving of the project was approximately US$ 5.1 million with net saving of US$ 3.5 million for the period from 2001 to 2011. The net present value of the project is US$ 3.2 million with a payback period of 3.4 years. Electronic hospital information systems and health records hold the potential to be useful tools for quality improvement and error reduction. Adoption of such systems, however, has been slow and erratic, worldwide. Utilizing the concept of net present value, development of such a system may be financially viable for some institutions. Instead of simply replacing paper, these systems may also be used to improve information management and improve quality of patient care.",

    "title": "[Data collection in anesthesia. Experiences with the inauguration of a new information system].",
    "abstract": "In many institutions information systems are used to process off-line anaesthesia data for invoices, statistical purposes, and quality assurance. Information systems are also increasingly being used to improve process control in order to reduce costs. Most of today's systems were created when information technology and working processes in anaesthesia were very different from those in use today. Thus, many institutions must now replace their computer systems but are probably not aware of how complex this change will be. Modern information systems mostly use client-server architecture and relational data bases. Substituting an old system with a new one is frequently a greater task than designing a system from scratch. This article gives the conclusions drawn from the experience obtained when a large departmental computer system is redesigned in an university hospital. The new system was based on a client-server architecture and was developed by an external company without preceding conceptual analysis. Modules for patient, anaesthesia, surgical, and pain-service data were included. Data were analysed using a separate statistical package (RS/1 from Bolt Beranek), taking advantage of its powerful precompiled procedures. Development and introduction of the new system took much more time and effort than expected despite the use of modern software tools. Introduction of the new program required intensive user training despite the choice of modem graphic screen layouts. Automatic data-reading systems could not be used, as too many faults occurred and the effort for the user was too high. However, after the initial problems were solved the system turned out to be a powerful tool for quality control (both process and outcome quality), billing, and scheduling. The statistical analysis of the data resulted in meaningful and relevant conclusions. Before creating a new information system, the working processes have to be analysed and, if possible, made more efficient; a detailed programme specification must then be made. A servicing and maintenance contract should be drawn up before the order is given to a company. Time periods of equal duration have to be scheduled for defining, writing, testing and introducing the program. Modern client-server systems with relational data bases are by no means simpler to establish and maintain than previous mainframe systems with hierarchical data bases, and thus, experienced computer specialists need to be close at hand. We recommend collecting data only once for both statistics and quality control. To verify data quality, a system of random spot-sampling has to be established. Despite the large investments needed to build up such a system, we consider it a powerful tool for helping to solve the difficult daily problems of managing a surgical and anaesthesia unit.",

The data come from a health information system of a non-governmental organization with a decade of experience in health services delivery in Samburu District, Kenya. The differential referral patterns from two communities are examined in some detail to shed more light on the meaning of a 'referral rate' in this context. First, referral rates over time for two clinics are calculated and compared. These quantitative data, obtained from monthly reports from 1989 to 1997, are interpreted in the light of qualitative data obtained from interviews with community health workers, nurses and members of the communities. The main differences in referral between these ostensibly similar communities are for malaria, trauma and anaemia. Social, environmental and specific health services factors are used to explain these differences. We demonstrate that basic information from health information systems, which tell us little on their own because referral in this context is a rare event, can be combined with local knowledge from the community to provide evidence for health managers to set priorities for public health and clinical interventions.",

The main results showed that there are fragilities like the use of the form just for the record and the insufficient training of the teams. However, the positive aspect is that the Primary Health Care Information System is the leading source of health information and statistics, and that its information can and must be used for health planning activities. Thus, it is an information system that assists municipal management and the actions in health of its teams, alerting the community to the need for care of individual health.",

    "title": "Early Effects of Information Revolution Interventions on Health Information System Performance in Ethiopia.",
    "abstract": "Health information systems (HISs) are essential to a country's health system as they provide critical support to health policymaking, management, financing, and service delivery. A well-functioning HIS should produce timely and reliable data that are available and easily accessible to decision-makers throughout the health system. Ethiopia has transitioned from a fragmented, paper-based health management information system (HMIS) to a harmonized, digital system used at points of collection and service delivery.In 2016, the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) launched the Information Revolution (IR), a transformative agenda aimed at enhancing the culture of data use, scaling priority HIS tools and systems, and strengthening HIS governance. Between 2016 and 2022, the MOH, Data Use Partnership, and other partners implemented a series of IR interventions that supported this agenda. These interventions included deploying and harmonizing digital HIS systems; strengthening HIS leadership, coordination, and governance; implementing the IR pathway strategy; enhancing capacity through supportive supervision, mentorship, and training; and improving performance monitoring teams. This article aims to synthesize the key HIS interventions implemented in Ethiopia as part of the IR and document the effects of these interventions on HIS performance.Early studies indicate promising improvements in HIS performance across health facilities in Ethiopia. However, challenges remain. To ensure sustainable progress, it is essential to continue addressing key challenges, such as system interoperability, HIS workforce, and capacity for data use at all levels. By building on the successes of the first Health Sector Transformation Plan and addressing these gaps, Ethiopia can advance its vision of a robust, data-driven health system capable of improving health outcomes and driving evidence-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The Healthcare Informatics Top 100 ranks the leading information system software providers to the healthcare industry by revenues. Due to the limited focus of the healthcare IS industry, many Top 100 companies serve other markets in addition to IS or healthcare. Thus, to most accurately compare companies, we asked cross-industry companies and companies with non-IS specific offerings to separate out those revenues specific to healthcare information systems. For some companies this proved an impossible task. In such cases, we relied on estimated revenues provided by professional sources throughout the industry. (Such companies are marked by an asterisk on the Top 100 list). According to industry analyst Sheldon I. Dorenfest of Sheldon I. Dorenfest & Associates, Chicago, the healthcare information systems marketplace can be divided into three parts: sales of computer and networking equipment account for 62 percent of revenue, software and software associated management services account for 33 percent, and consultation and other management services account for 5 percent. The Healthcare Informatics Top 100 features companies offering software and software associated management services as primary source of revenue (this includes resales of hardware and networking equipment). Companies not eligible for the Top 100 include investment companies, and companies for which consulting, non-software management services, or hardware or medical equipment is the primary source of revenue.",

    "abstract": "A large number of chemicals are used on a regular basis in modern society. Thousands of new chemicals are added each year, many of which may have toxic properties constituting potential health hazards. Rapid assessment of the risk associated with the use of these chemicals is therefore essential to protect people from exposure to potentially harmful substances. Exposures to chemicals (and physical agents) are typically unevenly distributed geographically as well as temporally. Disease occurrence also shows geographically varying patterns. Geographic information systems (GIS) may be used to produce maps of exposure and/or disease to reveal spatial patterns. Exposure mapping using advanced GIS modeling may enhance exposure assessment in environmental epidemiology studies. Disease maps can be valuable tools in risk assessment to explore changes in disease patterns potentially associated with changes in environmental exposures. Spatial variations in risk and trends related to distance from pollution sources may be studied using software tools such as the Rapid Inquiry Facility, developed by the U.K. Small Area Health Statistics Unit and enhanced in the European Health and Environment Information System project, for an initial quick evaluation of any potential health hazards associated with an environmental pollutant.",

Systematic search of literature from 1996-2005 for evaluations of information systems used in the care of chronic illness. The relationship of design, quality, information systems components, setting, and other factors with process, quality outcomes, and health care costs was evaluated. In all, 109 articles were reviewed involving 112 information system descriptions. Chronic diseases targeted included diabetes (42.9% of reviewed articles), heart disease (36.6%), and mental illness (23.2%), among others. System users were primarily physicians, nurses, and patients. Sixty-seven percent of reviewed experiments had positive outcomes; 94% of uncontrolled, observational studies claimed positive results. Components closely correlated with positive experimental results were connection to an electronic medical record, computerized prompts, population management (including reports and feedback), specialized decision support, electronic scheduling, and personal health records. Barriers identified included costs, data privacy and security concerns, and failure to consider workflow. CONCLUSION The majority of published studies revealed a positive impact of specific health information technology components on chronic illness care. Implications for future research and system designs are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional feeling accompanying existing, impending, or potential tissue damage. Valid pain assessment and standardized pain documentation are important in oncology pain management; however, they are still deficient. Thus, we developed a pain assessment and record information system for nurses in the oncology department and implemented a questionnaire survey to evaluate users' acceptance of the system. The pain assessment system focused on usability and efficiency to provide a modified workflow that was safe, less time-consuming, patient centered, enjoyable, and efficient. The pain assessment and record chart types in the system enabled greater standardization of pain assessments and records. The application of the system greatly improved the efficiency of nursing in the oncology department, guiding nurses in an accurate and comprehensive patient pain assessment and contributing significantly to further improvement in pain care standards and care decisions. Nurses and doctors surveyed reported a high degree of satisfaction with factors such as saving time and improving the capacity of pain control, suggesting that the system enhanced the quality of pain management. Through this system, we can promote pain management, improving care quality for patients.",

The recommended method is inspired by the French method based on the work of the Group for the Modernization of the Hospital Information System (GMSIH) [1]. The developed model allows to assign a \"Unique Identifier\" (PatientID) to each patient from his profile of identification features (name, date of birth, gender,…). The patient ID is a sequence of 20 characters plus a security \"key\" of 2 characters. A reliability test of the model has been performed to take into account identity anomalies (duplicate, collision).",

The objective of this study was to show how mathematically weighted, publicly available, relevant demographics data can be integrated with Geographic Information Systems to identify and rank potential locations for new primary healthcare facilities. Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage was mathematically weighted with respect to the usual resident population and the number of people not in the labour force data, at Statistical Area level 1 (SA1). Smoothing was applied by repeating the process at Statistical Area level 2, 3 and 4 to produce a quasi-index of priority. A total of 229 SA1 areas were identified and preselected as potential primary healthcare facility infrastructure sites across Australia. The quasi-index was incorporated into a Geographic Information System to produce a map identifying and ranking areas of relative need. Combining a mathematical approach with Geographic Information Systems can yield significant qualitative and quantitative advantages over conventional methods of site selection.",

    "abstract": "The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS ) is a dynamic system of psychometrically sound patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. There has been a recent increase in the use of PROMIS measures, yet little has been written about the reporting of these measures in the field of orthopedics. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the uptake of PROMIS measures across orthopedics and to identify the type of PROMIS measures and domains that are most commonly used in orthopedic research and practice. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using keywords and database-specific subject headings to capture orthopedic studies reporting PROMIS measures through November 2018. Our inclusion criteria were use of PROMIS measures as an outcome or used to describe a population of patients in an orthopedic setting in patients ≥ 18 years of age. We excluded non-quantitative studies, reviews, and case reports. Our final search yielded 88 studies published from 2013 through 2018, with 57% (50 studies) published in 2018 alone. By body region, 28% (25 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, hand), 36% (32 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the lower extremity (hip, knee, ankle, foot), 19% (17 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the spine, 10% (9 studies) reported PROMIS measures in trauma patients, and 6% (5 studies) reported PROMIS measures in general orthopedic patients. The majority of studies reported between one and three PROMIS domains (82%, 73 studies). The PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) approach was most commonly used (81%, 72 studies). The most frequently reported PROMIS domains were physical function (81%, 71 studies) and pain interference (61%, 54 studies). Our review found an increase in the reporting of PROMIS measures over the recent years. Utilization of PROMIS measures in orthopedic populations is clinically appropriate and can facilitate communication of outcomes across different provider types and with reduced respondent burden. The protocol for this systematic review was designed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and is registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42018088260).",

Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop and analyze an RA following well-established architecture design methods. Domain analysis was performed to scope and model the domain of HISs. For the architecture design, we applied the views and beyond approach and designed the RA's views based on the stakeholders and features from the domain analysis. We evaluated the RA with a case study. We derived the following four architecture views for HISs: The context diagram, decomposition view, layered view, and deployment view. Each view shows the architecture of the HIS from a different angle, suitable for various stakeholders. Based on a Japanese hospital information system study, we applied the RA and derived the application architecture. We demonstrated that the methods of the software architecture design community could be used in the healthcare domain effectively and showed the applicability of the RA.",

This study explored the gaps and factors influencing HMIS in the context of a changing health sector in Tanzania. A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in 11 heath facilities in Kilombero district between January and February 2008. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview 43 health workers on their knowledge, attitude, practice and factors for change on HMIS and HMIS booklets from these facilities were reviewed for completeness. Of all respondents, 81% had never been trained on HMIS, 65% did not properly define this system, 54% didn't know who is supposed to use the information collected and 42% did not use the collected data for planning, budgeting and evaluation of services provision. Although the attitude towards the system was positive among 91%, the reviewed HMIS booklets were never completed in 25% - 55% of the facilities. There were no significant differences in knowledge, attitude and practice on HMIS between clinicians and nurses. The most common type of HMIS booklets which were never filled were those for deliveries (55%). The gaps in the current HMIS were linked to lack of training, inactive supervision, staff workload pressure and the lengthy and laborious nature of the system. This research has revealed a state of poor health data collection, lack of informed decision-making at the facility level and the factors for change in the country's HMIS. It suggests need for new innovations including incorporation of HMIS in the ongoing reviews of the curricula for all cadres of health care providers, development of more user-friendly system and use of evidence-based John Kotter's eight-step process for implementing successful changes in this system.",

The ideal information system that supports malaria elimination includes: rapid and complete case reporting, incorporation of related data, such as census or health survey information, central data storage and management, automated and expert data analysis, and customized outputs and feedback that lead to timely and targeted responses. Spatial information enhances such a system, ensuring cases are tracked and mapped over time. Data sharing and coordination across borders are vital and new technologies can improve data speed, accuracy, and quality. Parts of this ideal information system exist and are in use, but have yet to be linked together coherently. Malaria elimination programs should support the implementation and refinement of information systems to support surveillance and response and ensure political and financial commitment to maintain the systems and the human resources needed to run them. National malaria programs should strive to improve the access and utility of these information systems and establish cross-border data sharing mechanisms through the use of standard indicators for malaria surveillance. Ultimately, investment in the information technologies that support a timely and targeted surveillance and response system is essential for malaria elimination.",

These requirements have been transposed into German legislation by the new radiation protection law and radiation protection ordinance that entered into force simultaneously on December 31 , 2018. The reporting and information system as provided by these regulations as well as the tasks, duties and powers of the parties involved are presented in the first part of this review article. In the second part, the established application-specified criteria for the significance - and thus the notification requirement - of (near-miss) events are itemized and explicated.",

    "title": "Meeting patients' needs with patient information systems: potential benefits of qualitative research methods.",
    "abstract": "This article reports on our pilot evaluation of an electronic patient information system for children with amblyopia and their parents. The aim was to investigate whether the information system would be able to improve the quality of care, as indicated by an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of care, and in an increase in patient satisfaction. In the pilot evaluation, we used qualitative research methods, exploring the impact of the information system on children and their parents, with the aim to find suitable indicators for a potential further, quantitative study. Yet we found that the system was little used and had marginal effects on the quality of care for children with amblyopia and their parents. It appeared that the main problem underlying this patient information system was that the needs of those people who actually would be using the system had never really been investigated. The designers had built their assumptions about these needs into the system. These appeared to be mistaken at so many levels that the system could not become a success. As a result of this pilot evaluation, the patient information project was thoroughly transformed. This study makes clear that a thorough exploration of user needs before building the system, using qualitative research methods, may be crucial because it can prevent mismatches and maximizes the chance that the eventual information system meets its most important aim: to enhance patient empowerment and improve the quality of care.",

    "abstract": "A system ensuring tight control access is used since 5 years at the University Geneva Hospitals (HUG) over a four campuses health care system with ambulatory care settings behaving like a small community care network. Access to identified clinical information is limited to care providers that have a therapeutic relationship with the patient and to those data needed for that relation. The same policy applies to administrative or scientific research accesses. This paper presents how the HUG met the challenging goal of protecting patient privacy within regulatory limits while keeping the system operational in terms of use and management. The main characteristics of the system are: (a) an institution-wide policy for access rights to the computerized patient record; (b) an institutional management of the contracts of the collaborators; (c) access profiles based on application-independent, fine-grained access rights; (d) a decentralized attribution of profession-specific access profiles; (e) a complete, centralized log of all accesses to the clinical information system; and (f) a decentralized verification of the accesses. Many of these characteristics can be maintained when evolving towards a trans-institutional computerized patient record, but new constraints need to be taken into account.",

We studied 9,001 deaths of children under one year registered in the SIM in 2012 and 1,424,691 live births present in the SINASC in 2011 and 2012. The databases were related with linkage in two steps - deterministic and probabilistic. We calculated the percentage of incompleteness of the variables common to the SIM and SINASC before and after using the technique. We could relate 90.8% of the deaths to their respective declarations of live birth, most of them paired deterministically. We found a higher percentage of pairs in Porto Alegre, Curitiba, and Campo Grande. In the capitals of the North region, the average of pairs was 84.2%; in the South region, this result reached 97.9%. The 11 variables common to the SIM and SINASC had 11,278 incomplete fields cumulatively, and we could recover 91.4% of the data after linkage. Before linkage, five variables presented excellent completeness in the SINASC in all Brazilian capitals, but only one variable had the same status in the SIM. After applying this technique, all 11 variables of the SINASC became excellent, while this occurred in seven variables of the SIM. The city of birth was significantly associated with the death component in the quality of the information. Despite advances in the coverage and quality of the SIM and SINASC, problems in the completeness of the variables can still be identified, especially in the SIM. In this perspective, linkage can be used to qualify important information for the analysis of infant mortality.",

Poor user interface design of nursing information system can cause problems in nurses' interaction with the system. This research aimed to evaluate the usability of nursing information system. During this study, five evaluators examined the nursing information system with the heuristic evaluation method and by using the checklist of Nielsen usability principles. Then, the identified problems were categorized into 10 Nielsen usability principles, and the severity of the problems was determined. They also attributed each problem to one of usability attributes. A total of 104 unique problems were identified. Most of the problems were related to the principle of \"consistency and standards.\" More than a third of the identified problems were classed as major and catastrophe, with the highest severity in the average problems of \"help and documentation\" and \"error prevention.\" Most of the identified problems were attributed to effectiveness and satisfaction. Because a significant number of identified usability problems in nursing information system were major and catastrophe and were attributed to effectiveness and satisfaction, being able to remedy the problems could improve nurses' interaction with the system user interface and increase satisfaction and effectiveness of nurses.",

Probabilistic record linkage was used between the SIM (2007-2008) and SINAN (2002-2008). A search was conducted in LPATB and LRLAB (2007-2008) for cases not recorded in SINAN. There were 125 deaths, of which 44.8% were not recorded in SINAN. In LPATB, 58 cases (5.1%) were in treatment and were not reported in SINAN. LRLAB showed 32 smear-positive cases not reported to SINAN and without treatment, representing primary default. Addition of the retrieved cases, led to a 14.6% increase in the incidence rate in 2007 and 11.6% in 2008. Underreporting of deaths from or with TB in the Mortality Information System and primary default revealed difficulties in access to adequate and timely treatment, calling for rethinking of strategies to detect cases for timely treatment.",

    "abstract": "The hospital has been the main target for Medical Informatics since the beginning of its development. Ancillary and clinical systems entered into the scene first when the financial issues were covered. From those kind of applications the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) represents perhaps the most important challenge to achieve where there is a representative subset of the organization with most variables under control to show the performance of the institution. At the ICU, information technology defines many of the tasks which are performed and enable the professionals to process and interpret the great quantities of data that is generated about the patients and the system in which they receive their treatment and quality assurance (QA) is now almost completely dependent upon information technology in pretty much facets of medical care. In this paper, a clinical information system developed for the ICU is presented where the use of validated severity illness scoring systems and standardized definitions for events and outcomes the care delivered can be analysed comparing clinical outcomes and resource utilization. Cost containment can be also applied and observations simultaneously with quality improvement standards can be undergone. Clinical research regarding medical and nursing practice is also very helpful.",

The working files are used to store all information necessary for the inventory of equipment in the local health unit (equipment inventory file) and results of automatic annual economic computations (residual values and amortisation quota file). Starting from data stored in the above-mentioned files the system can perform several procedures, such as control on data entry, economic computations and report printings.

The three essential concepts were data, information and indicators. The system at the AHC moved from unused data to unused information and to operational indicators. It also moved from a concern with data and information to one concerned with communication of information. The way a health information system evolves is, to a large extent, a reflection of the information needed by the group that is planning the system. In the AHC information needs were initially felt by senior management and attempts to involve other staff failed because of lack of timely feedback and a lack of management skills at all levels. In the process of trying to involve people and of getting to the correct type and amount of information, it became obvious that a health information system is complex and involves data as the major outputs, with people being the common thread of the system.",

    "abstract": "The EMS Agenda for the Future describes emergency medical services (EMS) as the intersection between public health, public safety, and health care. The most comprehensive method to describe, evaluate, and optimize these systems of care is using a state EMS data system. A centralized EMS data system can be a valuable tool to identify, evaluate, target, and improve EMS service delivery and patient care. Significant barriers, however, still exist to the standardization of EMS data systems and infrastructure nationally. Indeed, there is no comprehensive measurement of EMS service delivery or patient volume at the national level. In this article, we describe the successful development of a fully integrated, statewide EMS data system for quality improvement of EMS service delivery and patient care in North Carolina. The article also provides a platform for linking EMS with emergency physicians, other health care providers, and public health agencies responsible for planning, disease surveillance, and disaster preparedness. The North Carolina EMS Data System represents the successful development of a large, fully integrated, comprehensive statewide EMS database and quality improvement effort. The North Carolina EMS Data System applications include the Prehospital Medical Information System (PreMIS), the Credentialing Information System (CIS), the State Medical Asset Resource Tracking Tool (SMARTT), and the EMS Performance Improvement Toolkits. The system provides a quality and performance improvement program consistent with the idealized EMS design described in the EMS Agenda for the Future. The program has already achieved significant improvements in the quality of EMS service delivery, patient care, and integrated systems of care. Consistent with the goals of the 2007 Institute of Medicine's recommendations for EMS, the linkage of the North Carolina EMS Data System with other health care registries has created an environment that can evaluate larger systems of care and ultimate patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an introduction to the real-time clinical laboratory information system (LABKA), which is implemented on a Hewlett-Packard 1000 system. The system is optimized for fast data handling combined with easy control of on-line results, data flow, and linking of related information. The design of LABKA is based on the principle of having a short reporting time together with simplified working procedures. The system can be adjusted to small as well as very large laboratories. Data control is achieved by status information being returned to the operator in real-time, thus avoiding having to use matching lists. This information is presented immediately in response to the procedure which has caused the error. This method of early error detection simplifies working procedures, inhibits accumulation of errors, and increases the flexibility and speed of data reporting. As a result, the number of requested stat analyses has been reduced by 50 percent. Working lists are not generally used. Instead, requisition information is transferred on-line to the instruments on request. A fourth-generation program system for entry, calculation, and test of manually entered data, called RUCAT (1), has been developed. This system enables the user to define forms on vdu-terminals, specify calculations, and test all manually entered data. The LABKA system can also produce cumulative reporting as standard reporting, in real time, fast and in a very high print quality. The real-time demands have strongly influenced the design and layout of the lab files and system design.",

    "abstract": "Differences in the terms used to classify diseases in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines and for health information system (HIS) disease surveillance could easily create confusion among health care workers. If the equivalent terms in the two classifications are not clear to health workers who are following the guidelines, they may have problems in performing the dual activities of case management and disease surveillance. These difficulties could adversely affect an individual's performance as well as the overall effectiveness of the IMCI strategy or HIS surveillance, or both. We interviewed key informants to determine the effect of these differences between the IMCI and HIS classifications on the countries that were implementing the IMCI guidelines. Four general approaches for addressing the problem were identified: translating the IMCI classifications into HIS classifications; changing the HIS list to include the IMCI classifications; using both the IMCI and HIS classification systems at the time of consultations; and doing nothing. No single approach can satisfy the needs of all countries. However, if the short-term or medium-term goal of IMCI planners is to find a solution that will reduce the problem for health workers and is also easy to implement, the approach most likely to succeed is translation of IMCI classifications into HIS classifications. Where feasible, a modification of the health information system to include the IMCI classifications may also be considered.",

Researchers explored initial implementation strategies, discussed employee experiences and analyzed employee satisfaction. Transcript-based analysis and axial coding were completed to illustrate recurring phenomena. Common attributes were identified by two gerontological nurse experts and a researcher with human factors expertise. Common themes emerging from 22 focus groups and direct observation of more than 120 nursing home staff were perception and cognition, change, workable systems, competence, and connectedness. Implementation strategies associated with lower satisfaction were availability of equipment, training resources, and the presence of information technology professionals. Initial clinical information system implementation strategies and employee satisfaction could be enhanced by the inclusion of a system life cycle charter plan, emphasizing change management procedures, improving start-up projections, hiring adequately trained information technology staff, and providing a system support plan. Findings will be useful to administrators and policy makers who are contemplating implementation of a clinical information system.",

    "title": "Use of routine health information systems data in developing and monitoring district and facility health plans: a scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Routine Health Information Systems data should be used in a systematic and institutionalised manner to support the making of plans, the monitoring of plans and in supportive supervision. To explore to what extent there is discussion about the linkage between planning, monitoring and supervision of sub-national programs using routine data we conducted a scoping review. The review question was: How are routine health information systems used in developing and monitoring health plans at district and facility level? From a search of Ovid Medline (all), EMBASE and Web of Science along with a review of grey literature and involving a number of key stakeholders in identifying any missing resources a total of over 2200 documents were reviewed and data from 13 documents were extracted. Overall, there are many descriptions of how to implement and strengthen systems, ways to assess and improve data availability and quality, tools to improve the data use context, training in data use and mechanisms to involve stakeholders and strengthen infrastructure. However, there are gaps in examples of routine health data being used in the development, monitoring and supervision of plans at district and facility level. There appears to be no institutionalised obligation of planners to monitor plans, very little guidance on how to practically monitor programs and minimal discussion about how to use the routinely available data to supportively supervise the implementation of the plans. To overcome these shortcomings, we recommend that practical procedures to ensure linkage of existing district plans to regular monitoring of priority programs are institutionalised, that mechanisms for making managers institutionally accountable for monitoring and supervising these plans are put in place, and that practical guidelines for linking plans with routine health information system data and regular monitoring and supportive supervision are developed.",

The present work presents an ontology based model for a future information system to support these activities. The input data contains children health status, and drug characteristics. During clinical practice a database with what specialists mark as successful treatments is created. This database is gradually growing bigger and is built by physicians based on their good results related to a treatment for a certain health condition. The new ontology system proposed in this paper is supporting the e-prescription process. The relations are managed using the open source application Protégé and for suggesting treatments, using the database with successful treatments, we developed a special module that offers to physicians a selection from which they can chose the best treatment for their current case.",

    "title": "INTEROPERABILITY IN PERUVIAN BLOOD BANKS: PERCEPTION AND CHALLENGES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.",
    "abstract": "Blood banks play a fundamental role in healthcare systems, ensuring the availability of safe blood for transfusions. However, the fragmentation of information systems in Peruvian blood banks limits the traceability and efficiency of donor data management. This study aims to evaluate the perception of healthcare professionals regarding the need for an interoperable information system for blood banks. A cross-sectional study was conducted in public (MINSA), social security (ESSALUD), and private sector blood banks in Lima, Peru. A structured survey was applied to 65 professionals to assess the current status of their information systems, perceived limitations, and their acceptance of a new interoperable platform. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Most participants (85%) reported having an information system, but only 22% confirmed its interconnection with other blood banks. Furthermore, 97% supported the implementation of a new system with a centralized database for donor traceability. The main barriers identified were insufficient network infrastructure (43%) and budget constraints (31%). The results highlight the urgent need for an interoperable information system in Peruvian blood banks. Its implementation could enhance efficiency, reduce redundant testing, and improve transfusion safety. Future research should focus on feasibility assessments and policy recommendations.",

The integration consists of acquiring, digitizing, converting and filing the information from the above diagnostic modalities to the hospital's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The PACS, which is installed in the Onasio Cardiosurgery Centre of Athens, Greece, is responsible for archival, cataloging, retrieval and viewing of the large volume of patient examination data accumulated during his/her stay in the Centre. The ultimate goal is for all patient data, from all different examinations, to be viewed on dedicated client workstations. Information from different modalities can then be simultaneously presented to the attending physician, for a complete picture of the patient history and condition.",

    "title": "Adopting a personal digital assistant system: application of Lewin's change theory.",
    "abstract": "This paper reports a study exploring nurses' perceptions of adopting an information system using handheld computers (personal digital assistants) in their daily practice. Handheld computers have recently been used in nursing information systems for patient care, but few studies have explored their impact on users. By understanding clinicians' experiences of using this technology, strategies can be implemented to smooth the change process in adopting their use, thus achieving optimal patient outcomes. A descriptive, exploratory approach was used to study nurses' perceptions of using personal digital assistants as part of a hospital information system. A purposive sample of 15 nurses participated in one-to-one, in-depth interviews from February to March 2004. Nurses' perceptions of the adoption process were analysed using Lewin's force field theory of change as a framework. Nurses initially resisted using the personal digital assistant system (unfreezing stage), then came around to using it (moving stage), and finally adopted the system in their daily practice (re-freezing stage). However, an anticipatory stage also occurred and this could serve as a feedback mechanism to improve the system for current and future use. Educational programmes should be provided and strategic planning should be done in the early stage of implementing a policy to adopt new technology. In addition, the adoption process and learning period could be shortened by improving the system's content design. During this transition stage, dual charting should be used as a backup only for a limited time to avoid adding extra work to nurses' already heavy workload. Finally, the concept of confidentiality should be reinforced and stressed early in the educational programme to protect patient data, which can easily be accessed in computerized systems.",

    "abstract": "A hospital's clinical information system may require a specific environment in which to flourish. This environment is not yet well defined. We examined whether specific hospital characteristics are associated with highly automated and usable clinical information systems. This was a cross-sectional survey of 125 urban hospitals in Texas, United States using the Clinical Information Technology Assessment Tool (CITAT), which measures a hospital's level of automation based on physician interactions with the information system. Physician responses were used to calculate a series of CITAT scores: automation and usability scores, four automation sub-domain scores, and an overall clinical information technology (CIT) score. A multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the relation between hospital characteristics and CITAT scores. We received a sufficient number of physician responses at 69 hospitals (55% response rate). Teaching hospitals, hospitals with higher IT operating expenses (>$1 million annually), IT capital expenses (>$75,000 annually) and hospitals with larger IT staff (> or = 10 full-time staff) had higher automation scores than hospitals that did not meet these criteria (p < 0.05 in all cases). These findings held after adjustment for bed size, total margin, and ownership (p < 0.05 in all cases). There were few significant associations between the hospital characteristics tested in this study and usability scores. Academic affiliation and larger IT operating, capital, and staff budgets are associated with more highly automated clinical information systems.",

    "abstract": "The Maternal and Child Health Information Network--MATCH--was begun in 1984 as a demonstration project with support from the Division of Maternal and Child Health of the Health Resources and Services Administration, Public Health Service. The primary purpose of the project was the development of a system to manage data related to prenatal, child health, family planning, and genetic services that are delivered with State support in clinics in the State of Ohio. The design of MATCH enables the same data base to be used at both the State and local levels. Because it allows all participants, central and district, to manipulate the raw data, it is called an end-user--as opposed to a batch retrieval--system. Data recorded on individual forms during each client's visit to local service clinics are collected and entered into a microcomputer whose software package is a commercial data base. The clinic can then use the data for its purposes: program planning, management, evaluation, client referrals, appointment followup, quality control, and billing. The same data are also uploaded by central office staff to the State's DEC mainframe from data-filled disks mailed in by the clinics. Personnel who staff local projects can access their own data on the mainframe computer to generate reports for local use and send and receive messages electronically. That is, the system is \"interactive.\" The intent is to first link data generated by the primary care and preventive programs of maternal and child health (MCH) in an information system,then link that system to other health data arriving at the State health department (for example, birth and death certificates), and, finally, to use the system as the basis for a State level MCH primary care data system in Ohio for surveillance, planning,management, quality control, accountability,and research purposes.",

    "title": "Intelligibility of Haptic Signals in Vehicle Information Systems.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to verify changes in a driver's emotions through the physical characteristics of haptic signals. This is to improve the performance of drivers by designing haptic signals with emotional semantics. Currently, drivers receive a variety of information through intelligent systems installed in their vehicles. Because this is mainly achieved through visual and auditory channels, an excessive amount of information is provided to drivers, which increases the amount of information and cognitive load that they must accept. This, in turn, can reduce driving safety. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a haptic signal, a sensory channel that has not been widely used in in-vehicle information systems. The experiment was performed to collect a driver's emotions according to the haptic signal in a driving simulator. Haptic signals were designed by various frequencies and accelerations, and driver emotions were collected through Kansei engineering techniques and analyzed through factor analysis. To verify intelligibility, haptic signals were compared and evaluated based on response time, response rate, and amount of transmitted information. The final determined emotional map consisted of dangerousness and urgency. Based on the emotional map, four emotional semantic haptic signals were designed. It was confirmed that these four signals displayed higher performance than the discriminability haptic signal in terms of response time, response rate, and amount of transmitted information. Using emotional maps, it is possible to design haptic signals that can be applied to various driving situations. These maps may also assist in securing design guidelines for haptic signals that apply to in-vehicle information systems.",

    "abstract": "The research of environmental geochemistry entered the big data era. Environmental big data is a kind of new method and thought, which brings both opportunities and challenges to GIS-based spatial analysis in geochemical studies. However, big data research in environmental geochemistry is still in its preliminary stage, and what practical problems can be solved still remain unclear. This short review paper briefly discusses the main problems and solutions of spatial analysis related to the big data in environmental geochemistry, with a focus on the development and applications of conventional GIS-based approaches as well as advanced spatial machine learning techniques. The topics discussed include probability distribution and data transformation, spatial structures and patterns, correlation and spatial relationships, data visualisation, spatial prediction, background and threshold, hot spots and spatial outliers as well as distinction of natural and anthropogenic factors. It is highlighted that the integration of spatial analysis on the GIS platform provides effective solutions to revealing the hidden spatial patterns and spatially varying relationships in environmental geochemistry, demonstrated by an example of cadmium concentrations in the topsoil of Northern Ireland through hot spot analysis. In the big data era, further studies should be more inclined to the integration and application of spatial machine learning techniques, as well as investigation on the temporal trends of environmental geochemical features.",

The data used in this study were obtained from 729 hospitals that belong to both ministries by using a data collection tool. The results indicate that there have been considerable differences among the hospitals owned by the two ministries in terms of human resources and information systems. The hospital managers and decision makers making their decisions based on the data produced by current hospital information system (HIS) would more likely face very important difficulties after merging MoH and MoLSS hospitals in Turkey. It is also possible to claim that the level and adequacy of computing abilities and devices do not allow the managers of public hospitals to use computer technology effectively in their information management practices. Lack of technical information, undeveloped information culture, inappropriate management styles, and being inexperienced are the main reasons of why HIS does not run properly and effectively in Turkish hospitals.",

    "title": "Lightweight application for generating clinical research information systems: MAGIC.",
    "abstract": "Our purpose was to build and test a lightweight solution for generating clinical research information systems (CRIS) that would allow non-IT professionals with basic knowledge of computer usage to quickly define and build a ready-to-use, safe and secure web-based clinical research system for data management. We use the acronym MAGIC (Medical Application Generator InteraCtive) for the system. The generated CRIS should be very easy to build and use, so a common LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL Perl) platform was used, which also enables short development cycles. The application was built and tested using eXtreme Programming (XP) principles by a small development team consisting of one informatics specialist, one physician and one graphical designer/programmer. The parameter and graphical user interface (GUI) definitions for the CRIS can be made by non-IT professionals using an intuitive English-language-like formalism called application definition language (ADL). From these definitions, the MAGIC builds an end-user CRIS that can be used on a wide variety of platforms (from standard workstations to hand-held devices). A working example of a national health-care-quality assessment program is presented to illustrate this process. The lightweight application for generating CRIS (MAGIC) has proven to be useful for both clinical and analytical users in real working environment. To achieve better performance and interoperability, we are planning to recompile the application using XML schemas (XSD) in HL7 CDA or openEHR archetypes formats used for parameters definition and for data interchange between different information systems.",

The transition should be gradual, therefore a multilevel approach to the data is suggested, enabling us the transition, as well as including of the new, upcoming standards. The process of transition was started by the system covering the doctor's work. Responses to this part were very positive; therefore, we estimate that we are on the right way.

    "abstract": "To examine the costs of complementary information generation activities in a resource-constrained setting and compare the costs and outputs of information subsystems that generate the statistics on poverty, health and survival required for monitoring, evaluation and reporting on health programmes in the United Republic of Tanzania. Nine systems used by four government agencies or ministries were assessed. Costs were calculated from budgets and expenditure data made available by information system managers. System coverage, quality assurance and information production were reviewed using questionnaires and interviews. Information production was characterized in terms of 38 key sociodemographic indicators required for national programme monitoring. In 2002-03 approximately US$ 0.53 was spent per Tanzanian citizen on the nine information subsystems that generated information on 37 of the 38 selected indicators. The census and reporting system for routine health service statistics had the largest participating populations and highest total costs. Nationally representative household surveys and demographic surveillance systems (which are not based on nationally representative samples) produced more than half the indicators and used the most rigorous quality assurance. Five systems produced fewer than 13 indicators and had comparatively high costs per participant. Policy-makers and programme planners should be aware of the many trade-offs with respect to system costs, coverage, production, representativeness and quality control when making investment choices for monitoring and evaluation. In future, formal cost-effectiveness studies of complementary information systems would help guide investments in the monitoring, evaluation and planning needed to demonstrate the impact of poverty-reduction and health programmes.",

    "abstract": "Rising obesity rates in the United States has spurred efforts by health advocates to encourage more active lifestyles including walking. Ensuring the availability, quality and safety of pedestrian walkways has become an important issue for government at all levels. Pedestrian paths in Campbell County Kentucky were evaluated using a ranking criteria developed by the Walking and Bicycling Suitability Assessment (WABSA) project at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health. A pedestrian path Geographic Information System (GIS) data-layer was created and mobile GIS units were used to assess the sidewalk segments using the ranking. Data from sidewalk surveys were compared with Census 2000 blockgroup information on age of housing, population density and household transportation characteristics to examine the correlation between these factors and sidewalk presence and quality. The analysis explored to use of census data to predict walkability factors and looked for trends in quality and availability of pedestrian paths over time. Results showed higher overall scores for older urban areas adjacent to the Ohio River and Cincinnati. Housing built in the 1970s and 1980s showed the lowest scores while more recent housing showed improvement over earlier decades. Age of housing was determined to be a useful predictor while economic and population density attributes showed no correlation with walkability factors. Census housing age data are the most useful predictor of walkability demonstrating clear trends over time. The study shows improvements in walkways availability over the past few decades. However infrastructure improvements are needed to provide more extensive pedestrian walkways and linkages between existing walkways in Campbell County.",

    "title": "Arden/J: an architecture for MLM execution on the Java platform.",
    "abstract": "The Arden Syntax was introduced more than 10 years ago, but it is still not in widespread use. One reason might be that for each particular architecture and information system, a different Arden Syntax compiler must be written as well as a program for the runtime execution of the medical logic modules (MLMs). The authors have designed and implemented an architecture that increases the portability of Arden Syntax rules, using the Java platform. The portability to a target information system is achieved by the addition of appropriate adapter components, which they call mappers. These mappers are dynamically selected using explicit and implicit elements of MLMs. Furthermore, they can help translate data from the clinical information system representation into the representation needed by an MLM. This was validated by an experiment in two clinical units. Also, the authors propose a convention to name signals that trigger other MLMs (called intermediate states) so that they remain unique to each institution. The authors implemented this architecture in their clinical system and in an XML-based medical record application that has been used experimentally in their urology and nephrology departments. The Tetrasys company that provided the medical record was able to incorporate their runtime without modifications, and typical MLM execution time was less than 1 sec.",

    "title": "An in-depth, exploratory assessment of the implementation of the National Health Information System at a district level hospital in Tanzania.",
    "abstract": "A well functioning Health Information System (HIS) is crucial for effective and efficient health service delivery. In Tanzania there is a national HIS called Mfumo wa Taarifa za Uendeshaji Huduma za Afya (MTUHA). It comprises a guideline/manual, a series of registers for primary data collection and secondary data books where information from the registers is totalled or used for calculations. A mix of qualitative methods were used. These included key informant interviews; staff interviews; participant observations; and a retrospective analysis of the hospital's 2010 MTUHA reporting documents and the hospital's development plan. All staff members acknowledged data collection as part of their job responsibilities. However, all had concerns about the accuracy of MTUHA data. Access to training was limited, mathematical capabilities often low, dissemination of MTUHA knowledge within the hospital poor, and a broad understanding of the HIS's full capabilities lacking.Whilst data collection for routine services functioned reasonably well, filling of the secondary data tools was unsatisfactory. Internal inconsistencies between the different types of data tools were found. These included duplications, and the collection of data that was not further used. Sixteen of the total 72 forms (22.2%) that make up one of the key secondary data books (Hospital data/MTUHA book 2) could not be completed with the information collected in the primary data books.Moreover, the hospital made no use of any of the secondary data. The hospital's main planning document was its development plan. Only 3 of the 22 indicators in this plan were the same as indicators in MTUHA, the information for 9 more was collected by the MTUHA system but figures had to be extracted and recalculated to fit, while for the remaining 10 indicators no use could be made of MTUHA at all. The HIS in Tanzania is very extensive and it could be advisable to simplify it to the core business of data collection for routine services. Alternatively, the more comprehensive, managerial aspects could be sharpened for each type of facility, with a focus upon the hospital level. In particular, hospital planning documents need to be more closely aligned with MTUHA indicators.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research is to explore factors influencing the management decisions to adopt human resource information system (HRIS) in the hospital industry of Bangladesh-an emerging developing country. To understand this issue, this paper integrates two prominent adoption theories-Human-Organization-Technology fit (HOT-fit) model and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Thirteen factors under four dimensions were investigated to explore their influence on HRIS adoption decisions in hospitals. Employing non-probability sampling method, a total of 550 copies of structured questionnaires were distributed among HR executives of 92 private hospitals in Bangladesh. Among the respondents, usable questionnaires were 383 that suggesting a valid response rate of 69.63%. We classify the sample into 3 core groups based on the HRIS initial implementation, namely adopters, prospectors, and laggards. The obtained results specify 5 most critical factors i.e. IT infrastructure, top management support, IT capabilities of staff, perceived cost, and competitive pressure. Moreover, the most significant dimension is technological dimension followed by organisational, human, and environmental among the proposed 4 dimensions. Lastly, the study found existence of significant differences in all factors across different adopting groups. The study results also expose constructive proposals to researchers, hospitals, and the government to enhance the likelihood of adopting HRIS. The present study has important implications in understanding HRIS implementation in developing countries.",

    "title": "Using hub technology to facilitate information system integration in a health-care enterprise.",
    "abstract": "The deployment and maintenance of multiple point-to-point interfaces between a clinical information system, such as a laboratory information system, and other systems within a healthcare enterprise is expensive and time consuming. Moreover, the demand for such interfaces is increasing as hospitals consolidate and clinical laboratories participate in the development of regional laboratory networks and create host-to-host links with laboratory outreach clients. An interface engine, also called a hub, is an evolving technology that could replace multiple point-to-point interfaces from a laboratory information system with a single interface to the hub, preferably HL7 based. The hub then routes and translates laboratory information to other systems within the enterprise. Changes in application systems in an enterprise where a centralized interface engine has been implemented then amount to thorough analysis, an update of the enterprise's data dictionary, purchase of a single new vendor-supported interface, and table-based parameter changes on the hub. Two other features of an interface engine, support for structured query language and information store-and-forward, will facilitate the development of clinical data repositories and provide flexibility when interacting with other host systems. This article describes the advantages and disadvantages of an interface engine and lists some problems not solved by the technology. Finally, early developmental experience with an interface engine at the University of Michigan Medical Center and the benefits of the project on system integration efforts are described, not the least of which has been the enthusiastic adoption of the HL7 standard for all future interface projects.",

    "abstract": "The demand for cloud computing has drastically increased recently, but this paradigm has several issues due to its inherent complications, such as non-reliability, latency, lesser mobility support, and location-aware services. Fog computing can resolve these issues to some extent, yet it is still in its infancy. Despite several existing works, these works lack fault-tolerant fog computing, which necessitates further research. Fault tolerance enables the performing and provisioning of services despite failures and maintains anti-fragility and resiliency. Fog computing is highly diverse in terms of failures as compared to cloud computing and requires wide research and investigation. From this perspective, this study primarily focuses on the provision of uninterrupted services through fog computing. A framework has been designed to provide uninterrupted services while maintaining resiliency. The geographical information system (GIS) services have been deployed as a test bed which requires high computation, requires intensive resources in terms of CPU and memory, and requires low latency. Keeping different types of failures at different levels and their impacts on service failure and greater response time in mind, the framework was made anti-fragile and resilient at different levels. Experimental results indicate that during service interruption, the user state remains unaffected.",

Therefore, data security, privacy and user authentication are enormously important for accessing important medical data over insecure communication. Recently, many user authentication protocols for TMIS have been proposed in the literature and it has been observed that most of the protocols cannot achieve complete security requirements. In this paper, we have scrutinized two (Mishra et al., Xu et al.) remote user authentication protocols using smart card and explained that both the protocols are suffering against several security weaknesses. We have then presented three-factor user authentication and key agreement protocol usable for TMIS, which fix the security pitfalls of the above mentioned schemes. The informal cryptanalysis makes certain that the proposed protocol provides well security protection on the relevant security attacks. Furthermore, the simulator AVISPA tool confirms that the protocol is secure against active and passive attacks including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The security functionalities and performance comparison analysis confirm that our protocol not only provide strong protection on security attacks, but it also achieves better complexities along with efficient login and password change phase as well as session key verification property.",

This systematic review assessed the quality of HIS data in the region, focusing on the dimensions, and factors influencing this quality. It highlights the importance of systematic evaluation, ongoing training for data collectors in the analysis and use of data for decision-making, and the adoption of information and communication technologies in the healthcare system to improve data quality. These findings point the way to better use of health data and the need for a more integrated approach to digital health in SSA.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to explore the making and scaling of information infrastructures, as well as how the conditions for scaling a component may change for the vendor. The first research question is how the making and scaling of a healthcare information infrastructure can be done and by whom. The second question is what scope for manoeuvre there might be for vendors aiming to expand their market. This case study is based on an interpretive approach, whereby data is gathered through participant observation and semi-structured interviews. A case study of the making and scaling of an electronic system for general practitioners ordering laboratory services from hospitals is described as comprising two distinct phases. The first may be characterized as an evolving phase, when development, integration and implementation were achieved in small steps, and the vendor, together with end users, had considerable freedom to create the solution according to the users' needs. The second phase was characterized by a large-scale procurement process over which regional healthcare authorities exercised much more control and the needs of groups other than the end users influenced the design. The making and scaling of healthcare information infrastructures is not simply a process of evolution, in which the end users use and change the technology. It also consists of large steps, during which different actors, including vendors and healthcare authorities, may make substantial contributions. This process requires work, negotiation and strategies. The conditions for the vendor may change dramatically, from considerable freedom and close relationships with users and customers in the small-scale development, to losing control of the product and being required to engage in more formal relations with customers in the wider public healthcare market. Onerous procurement processes may be one of the reasons why large-scale implementation of information projects in healthcare is difficult and slow.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a recently installed system in the capture of key perianesthesia data. This study used an observational design and was conducted using a convenience sample of nurse anesthetists. Observational data of the nurse anesthetists'delivery of anesthesia care were collected using a touch-screen tablet computer utilizing an Access database customized observational data collection tool. A questionnaire was also administered to these nurse anesthetists to assess perceived accuracy, completeness, and satisfaction with the electronic documentation system. The major sources of data not documented in the system were anesthesiologist presence (20%) and placement of intravenous lines (20%). The major sources of inaccuracies in documentation were gas flow rates (45%), medication administration times (30%), and documentation of neuromuscular function testing (20%)-all of the sources of inaccuracies were related to the use of charting templates that were not altered to reflect the actual interventions performed.",

A special characteristic of the provided decision support is the high degree of integration in the underlying information system GTDS, i.e. the functions are triggered by events in the patient database, existing patient data is reused as input for the reasoning process and generated alerts are presented instantly to the end-user. The first routine field of application was supporting registrars to adhere to integrity constraints as defined by the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) during the documentation process. This information is important for the registrars since the checks of the IARC are an accepted standard for data quality in cancer registries. The expected benefit of this application area is less effort in achieving adherence to the specification of the IARC by preventing the costly rectification at a later time. During the last 5 months of the observation period 164 alerts were displayed. About 65% of the assessed alerts were considered to be correct. Especially, the analysis of the incorrect alerts revealed some shortcomings in the knowledge behind some of the integrity constraints of the IARC. The general feedback from the end-users indicate positive user satisfaction. Currently, the shell is in use in six hospital cancer registries.",

    "abstract": "The use of clinical databases improves quality of care, reduces operating costs, helps secure managed care contracts, and assists in clinical research. Because of the large physician input required to maintain these systems, private institutions have often found them difficult to implement. At LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, we developed a cardiovascular information system (LDS-CIS) patterned after the Duke University Cardiovascular Database and designed for ease of use in a private hospital setting. Features of the LDS-CIS include concise single-page report forms, a relational database engine that is easily queried, automatic generation of final procedure reports, and merging of all data with the hospital's existing information system. So far, data from more than 14,000 patients have been entered. LDS-CIS provides access to data for research to improve patient care. For example, by using data generated by LDS-CIS, the policy requiring surgical backup during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was eliminated, resulting in no increased patient risk while saving nearly $1 million in 1 year. LDS-CIS generates physician feedback reports documenting performance compared with peers. This physician self-evaluation has standardized and improved care. Information from LDS-CIS has been instrumental in securing and maintaining managed care contracts. LDS-CIS risk analysis provides physicians with outcomes data specific to their current patient's demographics and level of disease to assist in point of care decisions. The use of LDS-CIS in the routine operations of LDS Hospital heart services has been found to be feasible, beneficial, and cost-effective.",

However, errors related to documentation have been identified as a significant risk for the quality and safety of care. This study examined whether information system's support for documentation and nurses' documentation competence are associated with how frequently nurses detect documentation-related errors that have caused an adverse event. A nationwide survey was conducted in 2020, and a total of 3610 nurses participated. Results from linear regression analyses showed that high documentation support from the information system and high documentation competence were associated with fewer detected documentation-related errors. Nurses with low documentation support from the system and low documentation competence detected the most errors. The results highlight the need to develop electronic health record functions in a way that they better support accurate documentation. Furthermore, organisations should invest in ensuring the documentation skills of nurses and providing appropriate training.",

Of the 77 studies identified, we selected 29, and 14 met the corrections production criteria for cases of underreporting: underreporting of deaths in the Mortality Information System, deaths declared as ill-defined causes or deaths from external causes declared with nonspecific codes. We found that the underreporting of external causes was not significantly different from what occurs in total deaths and sometimes was higher in small and medium-sized municipalities. The reclassification of ill-defined causes of death corrected external causes to non-negligible values. The selected studies differ on proposals for correction of unspecified external causes.

We extracted the following information from each study included: study year, region, objectives, type of geographic information system used, variables visualized by the geographic information system, and all other variables examined that related to maternal health. Of 5240 articles initially retrieved, 40 were included for detailed review. Most of the studies (n = 32) were done in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the studies (n = 33) visualized mothers' distance to health facilities and travel time to health care centres on geographic information systems. Other factors examined included antenatal care capacity (n = 4) and capacity of maternal health services (n = 3). Comprehensive research on the application of geographic information systems in maternal care is lacking.

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to explore approaches to understanding the usability of health information systems at regional and national levels. Several different methods are discussed in case studies from Denmark, Finland and Canada. They range from small scale qualitative studies involving usability testing of systems to larger scale national level questionnaire studies aimed at assessing the use and usability of health information systems by entire groups of health professionals. It was found that regional and national usability studies can complement smaller scale usability studies, and that they are needed in order to understand larger trends regarding system usability. Despite adoption of EHRs, many health professionals rate the usability of the systems as low. A range of usability issues have been noted when data is collected on a large scale through use of widely distributed questionnaires and websites designed to monitor user perceptions of usability. As health information systems are deployed on a widespread basis, studies that examine systems used regionally or nationally are required. In addition, collection of large scale data on the usability of specific IT products is needed in order to complement smaller scale studies of specific systems.",

A descriptive study was conducted on early neonatal deaths in hospitals between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002, to compare data entry in the Death Certificate (DC) and Mortality Information System (MIS) with a standardized form filled out with data of medical files from the mothers and newborn. The frequency with which the following variables failed to be recorded in the DC and SIM was studied: type of death, address, age of mother, gender, birth weight, and delivery type, age at death and gestational age. MIS reliability was verified using simple concordance, sensitivity and Kappa indicator. MIS recorded 451 deaths, of which 50 were excluded. Mother's age was omitted from MIS in 44.1% of cases. 85.7% to 100% of the variables not filled in for the DC were recovered from the medical files. There was good concordance between DC and medical files for type of delivery, weight and age. Birth weight and age of mother presented the least concordance between medical files and MIS. MIS presented 69.2% sensitivity for weight and 36.3% for age of mother, thus demonstrating little capability to correctly supply information to generate perinatal health indicators. Because of incomplete filling out, quality of the DC becomes precarious and makes the MIS inadequate, even though it covers 100% of neonatal deaths in Maceió. Inefficiency of the system is increased by failure of MIS technicians to correct errors found and input all the information available.",

The programming and maintenance problems of supporting multiple user interfaces to a single information system can be addressed by separating user-interface functionality from data-management subsystems, and by building user interfaces from object-based software components whose functionality is bound to an underlying server-client data-management architecture. Experience with this approach in a patient-tracking system suggests that this object-based approach is viable in the design of a user interface for a clinical information system.",

At present, there is a lack of uniformity and potential applicability in the dimensions employed to evaluate the data quality of health information system. Typically, different approaches (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) were utilized to evaluate data quality for health information system in the publications that were reviewed.

The objective of this study was to assess the quality of data collected in referral hospitals in Mali and Senegal after the routine information system (RIS) was strengthened. This was a multicenter observational study conducted during the pre-intervention period of a randomized controlled trial (trial QUARITE). The RIS was strengthened based on technical, organizational and behavioral factors. We included all women who gave birth in the 46 referral hospitals from October 1, 2007 to October 30, 2008. The completeness, completion and accuracy rates were monitored every 3 months in each hospital. The cost of investment needed to strengthen the existing RIS was also determined. The mean completeness rate ranged from 94 to 97% depending on the study period. The completion and accuracy rates increased during the study period from 72% and 79% to 87% and 93%, respectively (significant differences). The average investment per hospital was less than 1% of state subsidies for public hospitals. Strengthening the existing information system has set up an economically and technologically appropriate system for monitoring maternal and perinatal health in Senegal and Mali. We encourage policy makers and researchers from countries with limited resources to invest in RIS to improve and monitor the performance of health systems.",

We enrolled 19 participants from two local health departments to conduct an information needs assessment, create a conceptual design, and conduct a preliminary design validation. Interviews and thematic analysis were used to characterize information needs and solicit design recommendations from participants. Personas were constructed from participant background information, and scenario-based design was used to create a conceptual information system design. Two focus groups were conducted as a first iteration validation of information needs, personas, and scenarios. Eighty-nine information needs were identified. Two personas and 89 scenarios were created. Public health nurses and nurse managers confirmed the accuracy of information needs, personas, scenarios, and the perceived usefulness of proposed features of the conceptual design. Design artifacts were modified based on focus group results. Persona-driven design and scenario-based design are feasible methods to design for common work activities in different local health departments. Public health nurses and nurse managers should be engaged in the design of systems that support their work.",

Because stakeholders represent diverse groups and needs, it is challenging to reach consensus on how to advance PRO development and harmonize data across settings to enable use for multiple secondary purposes. Collaborative national networks can facilitate the sharing of expertise, resources, and necessary infrastructure; create development, use, and reporting standards; optimize formats to efficiently store and transfer data; and disseminate tools and information for widespread uptake. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System offers an example of how collaborators can work across distances to form essential partnerships, create a common vision, and leverage technology to accelerate the development and testing of universal PROs that are broadly applicable across health conditions and settings.",

Therefore an information system for acquisition, on-line storage and retrieval of infection control data was developed together with Institut für Krankenhausausbau of Technische Universität Berlin. The output from the database of microbiological isolates is presented in diagrams for easy evaluation by the clinician and produced either on a graphic color display or on a plotter. The system was developed using a database which was set up retrospectively including about 5000 microbiological isolates from about 1000 intensive care patients of a Berlin university hospital from a period of 18 months. The first communication covers input and output of the data processing system by way of examples. Acquisition of isolates is facilitated at a display terminal using a program to check the data entry and to store the correct data record in a multiple index key oriented file system. Retrieval may be defined either selectively by means of keys, i.e. code of species, specimen or patient entry number or searching across the whole file and for given time periods. One may determine as well to retrieve only data records including test results from selected antibiotics.",

Third, get the Thai name by searching HN from the hospital information system (HIS). Then, send the new study to the new PACS via hospital level 7 (HL7) message. Finally, send images to the new PACS. The data were migrated from the existing PACS, integrated Thai name and sent them to the new PACS. The total migrated images of CR, CT and MR were 296,269, 692,860 and 42,941 images respectively. The average migrated images per series for CR, CT and MR were about 1.01, 89.84 and 15.53 images in successive order.

    "abstract": "Many information systems have failed when deployed into complex health-care settings. We believe that one cause of these failures is the difficulty in systematically accounting for the collaborative and exception-filled nature of medical work. In this methodological review paper, we highlight research from the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) that could help biomedical informaticists recognize and design around the kinds of challenges that lead to unanticipated breakdowns and eventual abandonment of their systems. The field of CSCW studies how people collaborate with each other and the role that technology plays in this collaboration for a wide variety of organizational settings. Thus, biomedical informaticists could benefit from the lessons learned by CSCW researchers. In this paper, we provide a focused review of CSCW methods and ideas-we review aspects of the field that could be applied to improve the design and deployment of medical information systems. To make our discussion concrete, we use electronic medical record systems as an example medical information system, and present three specific principles from CSCW: accounting for incentive structures, understanding workflow, and incorporating awareness.",

In addition to the detailed step-by-step implementation plan, the overall impact of the new system should be anticipated. The purchasers should consider such issues as new information flow and user communication patterns between patient care and ancillary and support departments; restructuring of fundamental approaches to work allocation for either batch or real-time systems; and new emphasis on any departments vital to problem-spotting and solving. At California Primary Physicians (CPP), an awareness of these changes did not develop until well after the official \"live\" data had passed and the staff had been successfully using the system for several months. This paper explains how the above issues have emerged and the impact they have had on CPP, and provides a framework for anticipating such matters in any system installation.",

    "title": "Health information systems - past, present, future.",
    "abstract": "In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter Reichertz' lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information systems in the future? The following lines of development for HIS were considered as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based processing and storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; (2) the shift from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital information systems towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of patients and health consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals and administrators; (4) the use of HIS data not only for patient care and administrative purposes, but also for health care planning as well as clinical and epidemiological research; (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical HIS problems to those of change management as well as of strategic information management; (6) the shift from mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and now also to data on the molecular level; (7) the steady increase of new technologies to be included, now starting to include ubiquitous computing environments and sensor-based technologies for health monitoring. As consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for institutional and (inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to explore new (transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for education in health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including appropriate knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system architectures, of adequate methods for strategic information management, of methods for modeling and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of comprehensive electronic patient records, providing appropriate access for health care professionals as well as for patients, in the broad sense as described here, e.g. including home care and health monitoring facilities. Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004, we have to recognize that we imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS have become one of the most challenging and promising fields of research, education and practice for medical informatics, with significant benefits to medicine and health care in general.",

A hybrid participatory design-grounded theory (GT-PD) method was used to obtain data and code them for ontology development. Prototyping was used to implement the ontology as a computer-based tool. Usability testing evaluated the computer-based tool. An empirically derived domain ontology and set of three problem-solving approaches were developed as a formalized model of the concepts and categories from the GT coding. The ontology and problem-solving approaches were used to design and implement a HIS that tested favorably in usability testing. The four stage approach illustrated in this paper is useful for designing and implementing an ontology as the basis for a HIS. The approach extends existing ontology development methodologies by providing an empirical basis for theory incorporated into ontology design.",

However, before ICT can be used in a specific patient population, the needs of that population must first be made explicit. In this paper we aim to explore the feasibility and functionality of an electronic information system to support head and neck (H&N) cancer care. We describe communication and information bottlenecks in supportive care for H&N cancer patients. These bottlenecks were used to determine the functionality of an electronic health information support system. We discern three perspectives of problems in H&N cancer care: lacking communication among professionals, lacking information about the disease and its treatment, and lacking supportive measures to reduce uncertainty and fear in patients. To support care, an information support system can facilitate (1). communication among all professionals involved and between professionals and patients, (2). professionals' and patients' access to information, (3). contact with fellow sufferers, and (4). early detection of patient problems by means of monitoring. Based on these analyses we subsequently built such a system and established a setting for evaluation. Information and communication technology can be tailored to address the communication and information bottlenecks in supportive H&N cancer care. As we aim to investigate whether care for H&N cancer patients may benefit from ICT, we are currently performing a clinical evaluation study.",

Thus, operational analysis and information systems are basic managerial tools to improve the efficiency of the projects. This paper presents an information system development methodology which has been used by the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) to assist different development projects of Central America. The methodology is geared on the one hand, towards systematizing the definition of the demand and of applications and, on the other, of the types of response required or deemed convenient, taking into account the technologies that are appropriate to the users' various capacities. The complete development cycle is based on good understanding of the social, organizational and human aspects of the project. Through the whole process, not only is the information system being developed and documented, but personnel is being trained and assisted in solving their problems, contributing thereby, to true transfer of technology. No new set of techniques of systems development is presented. What has been done is to carefully select elements of current technical practices, modifying tools and techniques to generate a unique methodology through which the information systems' requirements, specifications, and details may be expressed.",

Use of information systems improves nurses' ability to make decisions in a timely manner; however, nurses are still reluctant about or avoiding using information systems in their daily work. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among age, nursing education, computer experience, user involvement in implementation, nursing management support to use information systems, nurses' information system use, and information system outcomes (benefits and satisfaction). The study used an input-process-outcome framework, a descriptive correlational design, and a mailed survey with a random sample of staff nurses. Computer experience, user involvement, and nursing management support were found to significantly explain information system use. In addition, information system use was found to significantly explain nurses' perception of the benefits of using information systems and their satisfaction with using information systems. These results assist nursing administrators and leaders to change and/or restructure the appropriate work environment to enhance nurses' information system use and increase their satisfaction, thereby improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the results are presented from recent developments to increase the role of the HISCOM integrated hospital information system to support direct patient care. This process has resulted in an operational Electronic Obstetric Record System (EVS) and the introduction of a generic system (MDS) to document the medical care process starting in the outpatient clinics. These systems are based on a model of the clinical care process, agreed upon by clinicians. The EVS replaces the conventional paper record and was accepted mainly by the way the EVS follows and supports the care process. The main contribution is the completeness, the availability, and the support of the care related processes like scheduling next appointments and examinations, the reporting and the automatic creation of letters. The MDS approach addresses the issue of providing kernel information by episode about the care process to clinicians and managers. The MDS is based on the episode concept, which is not restricted to the outpatient departments, but can also be applied hospital wide, and even across the boundaries of the hospital. In this paper the categorisation of 'a proactive medical record' will be introduced, and the potential benefits of an integrated approach to the electronic medical record (EMR) will be addressed.",

    "title": "Integration of the UNHCR Refugee Health Information System into the National Health Information Management System for Uganda.",
    "abstract": "The Uganda Government, together with development partners, has provided continuing support services (including protection, food, nutrition, healthcare, water and sanitation) to refugee-hosting Districts to successfully manage refugees from different neighbouring countries in established settlements. This service has increased the need for timely and accurate information to facilitate planning, resource allocation and decision-making. Complexity in providing effective public health interventions in refugee settings coupled with increased funding requirements has created demands for better data and improved accountability. Health data management in refugee settings is faced with several information gaps that require harmonisation of the Ugandan National Health Management Information System (UHMIS) and United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Health Information System (RHIS). This article discusses the rationale for harmonisation of the UNHCR RHIS, which currently captures refugee data, with the UHMIS. It also provides insights into how refugee health data management can be harmonised within a country's national health management information system. A consultative meeting with various stakeholders, including the Ugandan Ministry of Health, district health teams, representatives from UNHCR, the United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF), United States Government and civil society organisations, was held with an aim to review the UHMIS and UNHCR RHIS health data management systems and identify ways to harmonise the two to achieve an integrated system for monitoring health service delivery in Uganda. Several challenges facing refugee-hosting district health teams with regard to health data management were identified, including data collection, analysis and reporting. There was unanimous agreement to prioritise an integrated data management system and harmonisation of national refugee stakeholder data requirements, guided by key recommendations developed at the meeting. This article outlines a proposed model that can be used to harmonise the UNHCR RHIS with the UHMIS. The national refugee stakeholder data requirements have been harmonised, and Uganda looks forward to achieving better health data quality through a more comprehensive national UHMIS to inform policy planning and evidence-based decision-making.",

    "title": "Fast choice of separation conditions for analyses by capillary zone electrophoresis using an information system Xemic.",
    "abstract": "An information system Xemic applicable in analytical chemistry is described and its use in capillary electrophoresis for searching suitable separation conditions is demonstrated. This system is capable to provide suitable separation conditions even for analytes for which no electrophoretic experiments have been published so far. The system works with a database of components of anionic character the analyses of which have been performed, published in reviewed scientific journals, and included into a database created by an expert. Moreover, the system learned to search also in abstracts or complete scientific articles to find articles dealing with the determination of a substance in a given sample matrix. When no experiments have been published so far for a defined substance in a specific matrix, Xemic shows the separation conditions for determination of the substance regardless of the matrix. When no response can be found for the analyte of interest at all, the system Xemic works like an expert in the field and searches chemically similar substances and offers a series of substances the physicochemical properties of which are close to the followed analyte with respect to the behavior in the electric field, and shows working conditions for their analysis. Thus, the analyst puts only the order in the form of a given analyte in a given matrix and obtains a recommendation of a separation system that should enable to perform a successful separation. The system is not rigid and enables the operator to change the importance of individual attributes used in similarity search so as to obtain a broader or narrower group of similar components. With a certain probability the analyte of interest can be successfully analyzed under separation conditions that suited for the analysis of the most similar substances in the given matrix.",

As in other fields, smart card use in health systems became popular due to their increased capacity and performance. Their efficient use with easy and fast data access facilities leads to implementation particularly widespread in security systems. In this paper, a smart card based healthcare information system is developed. The system uses smart card for personal identification and transfer of health data and provides data communication via a distributed protocol which is particularly developed for this study. Two smart card software modules are implemented that run on patient and healthcare professional smart cards, respectively. In addition to personal information, general health information about the patient is also loaded to patient smart card. Health care providers use their own smart cards to be authenticated on the system and to access data on patient cards. Encryption keys and digital signature keys stored on smart cards of the system are used for secure and authenticated data communication between clients and database servers over distributed object protocol. System is developed on Java platform by using object oriented architecture and design patterns.",

    "title": "Modeling functional neuroanatomy for an anatomy information system.",
    "abstract": "Existing neuroanatomical ontologies, databases and information systems, such as the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), represent outgoing connections from brain structures, but cannot represent the \"internal wiring\" of structures and as such, cannot distinguish between different independent connections from the same structure. Thus, a fundamental aspect of Neuroanatomy, the functional pathways and functional systems of the brain such as the pupillary light reflex system, is not adequately represented. This article identifies underlying anatomical objects which are the source of independent connections (collections of neurons) and uses these as basic building blocks to construct a model of functional neuroanatomy and its functional pathways. The basic representational elements of the model are unnamed groups of neurons or groups of neuron segments. These groups, their relations to each other, and the relations to the objects of macroscopic anatomy are defined. The resulting model can be incorporated into the FMA. The capabilities of the presented model are compared to the FMA and the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). Internal wiring as well as functional pathways can correctly be represented and tracked. This model bridges the gap between representations of single neurons and their parts on the one hand and representations of spatial brain structures and areas on the other hand. It is capable of drawing correct inferences on pathways in a nervous system. The object and relation definitions are related to the Open Biomedical Ontology effort and its relation ontology, so that this model can be further developed into an ontology of neuronal functional systems.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of vendor-based integrated clinical information technology was studied, and its effect on medication errors throughout the medication-use process in a health care system was evaluated. The integrated systems selected for implementation included computerized physician order entry, pharmacy and laboratory information systems, clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs), electronic drug dispensing systems (EDDSs), and a bar-code point-of-care medication administration system. The primary endpoint was the reduction in related medication errors. Secondary endpoints included the reductions in medication order turnaround time and EDDS override transactions. Integrated clinical information system technology was implemented in a multihospital health care system with a phased-in approach. A positive effect of this integration on medication errors throughout the medication-use process was demonstrated. Most prescribing errors decreased significantly in the selected categories monitored, specifically drug allergy detection, excessive dosing, and incomplete or unclear orders. Pharmacists were also twice as likely to identify dosages requiring adjustment for renal insufficiency when the integrated technology was in place and more than six times as likely for drug levels outside of the therapeutic range. A positive effect on medication administration safety was also demonstrated: 73 administration-related errors were intercepted through electronic bar-code scanning for every 100,000 doses charted. Integration of clinical information system technology decreased selected types of medication errors throughout the medication-use process in a health care system and improved therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with renal insufficiency and in patients receiving drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges through the use of CDSS alerts.",

    "title": "The health information system security threat lifecycle: an informatics theory.",
    "abstract": "This manuscript describes the health information system security threat lifecycle (HISSTL) theory. The theory is grounded in case study data analyzing clinicians' health information system (HIS) privacy and security (P&S) experiences in the practice context. The 'questerview' technique was applied to this study of 26 clinicians situated in 3 large Australian (across Victoria) teaching hospitals. Questerviews rely on data collection that apply standardized questions and questionnaires during recorded interviews. Analysis (using Nvivo) involved the iterative scrutiny of interview transcripts to identify emergent themes. Issues including poor training, ambiguous legal frameworks containing punitive threats, productivity challenges, usability errors and the limitations of the natural hospital environment emerged from empirical data about the clinicians' HIS P&S practices. The natural hospital environment is defined by the permanence of electronic HISs (e-HISs), shared workspaces, outdated HIT infrastructure, constant interruption, a P&S regulatory environment that is not conducive to optimal training outcomes and budgetary constraints. The evidence also indicated the obtrusiveness, timeliness, and reliability of P&S implementations for clinical work affected participant attitudes to, and use of, e-HISs. The HISSTL emerged from the analysis of study evidence. The theory embodies elements such as the fiscal, regulatory and natural hospital environments which impede P&S implementations in practice settings. These elements conflict with improved patient care outcomes. Efforts by clinicians to avoid conflict and emphasize patient care above P&S tended to manifest as security breaches. These breaches entrench factors beyond clinician control and perpetuate those within clinician control. Security breaches of health information can progress through the HISSTL. Some preliminary suggestions for addressing these issues are proposed. Legislative frameworks that are not related to direct patient care were excluded from this study. Other limitations included an exclusive focus on patient care tasks post-admission and pre-discharge from public hospital wards. Finally, the number of cases was limited by the number of participants who volunteered to participate in the study. It is reasonable to assume these participants were more interested in the P&S of patient care work than their counterparts, though the study was not intended to provide quantitative or statistical data. Nonetheless, additional case studies would strengthen the HISSTL theory if confirmatory, practice-based evidence were found.",

A comparison of two cross-sectional study designs was adopted, and the information systems success model, as proposed by DeLone and McLean (2003), was used to explore the effectiveness of the six dimensions of system quality, information quality, service quality, use, user satisfaction, and net benefits at 6 and 12 months after the introduction launch of the nursing information system in hospitals. Multiple regression analysis was used across the two cross-sectional studies. The research results found that the nursing information system conformed to the information systems success model, and half a year to 1 year after the introduction of the nursing information system, use affected the nursing information system net benefits via the mediator variable of user satisfaction; however, the effect of full mediation changed to partial mediation effect with time. The research results can be used as a reference for hospitals and nursing administrators for the newly developed nursing information system.",

    "title": "Utilization of a Clinical Trial Management System for the Whole Clinical Trial Process as an Integrated Database: System Development.",
    "abstract": "Clinical trials pose potential risks in both communications and management due to the various stakeholders involved when performing clinical trials. The academic medical center has a responsibility and obligation to conduct and manage clinical trials while maintaining a sufficiently high level of quality, therefore it is necessary to build an information technology system to support standardized clinical trial processes and comply with relevant regulations. The objective of the study was to address the challenges identified while performing clinical trials at an academic medical center, Asan Medical Center (AMC) in Korea, by developing and utilizing a clinical trial management system (CTMS) that complies with standardized processes from multiple departments or units, controlled vocabularies, security, and privacy regulations. This study describes the methods, considerations, and recommendations for the development and utilization of the CTMS as a consolidated research database in an academic medical center. A task force was formed to define and standardize the clinical trial performance process at the site level. On the basis of the agreed standardized process, the CTMS was designed and developed as an all-in-one system complying with privacy and security regulations. In this study, the processes and standard mapped vocabularies of a clinical trial were established at the academic medical center. On the basis of these processes and vocabularies, a CTMS was built which interfaces with the existing trial systems such as the electronic institutional review board health information system, enterprise resource planning, and the barcode system. To protect patient data, the CTMS implements data governance and access rules, and excludes 21 personal health identifiers according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule and Korean privacy laws. Since December 2014, the CTMS has been successfully implemented and used by 881 internal and external users for managing 11,645 studies and 146,943 subjects. The CTMS was introduced in the Asan Medical Center to manage the large amounts of data involved with clinical trial operations. Inter- and intraunit control of data and resources can be easily conducted through the CTMS system. To our knowledge, this is the first CTMS developed in-house at an academic medical center side which can enhance the efficiency of clinical trial management in compliance with privacy and security laws.",

    "title": "Research and Implementation of Mobile Internet Management Optimization and Intelligent Information System Based on Smart Decision.",
    "abstract": "The way by which artificial intelligence is implemented is similar to the thinking process of the human brain. People obtain information about external conditions through five senses, namely, vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and, through the further processing of the brain, it forms meaningful decision-making elements. Then, through the process of analysis and reasoning, further decisions are made. In the information age, the application of intelligent management information systems in various fields has promoted the modernization and intelligence of social development. From the perspective of intelligent decision-making, this paper analyzes the requirements of intelligent information systems and designs an intelligent information system based on mobile Internet management optimization, including system management optimization, and proposes an environment-based layer, network transport layer, and the three-tier system architecture of the smart service application layer. Finally, this paper considers the problem of data fusion after system expansion. According to the existing fuzzy fusion algorithm, a weight-based fuzzy fusion algorithm is proposed. The simulation analysis shows that the algorithm can be effectively applied in intelligent information systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of health grey literature, there is not a comprehensive information system for managing these valuable resources in Iran. This study aimed at identifying the barriers to and facilitators of implementing a comprehensive national information system for health grey literature. This study applied the qualitative research method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 19 experts in related fields. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data in MAXQDA. The data were codified and revised constantly and classified in some selected main and sub-categories based on their relative similarities and differences. Data analysis identified some barriers to the implementation of an information system for health grey literature in Iran, including two main categories (and some sub-categories): managerial issues (performance related issues, coordination issues, monitoring and supervision issues and attitudinal issues) and issues on data integration (data collecting issues, data recording issues, quality control issues, and issues on data organization, dissemination and use). Designing a national system for health grey literature in Iran needs a powerful authority, removing possible intersectional conflicts, a selection committee, written policies and strict quality control criteria, and protocols for storage, access, retrieval and metadata evaluation.",

    "title": "The impact of a Critical Care Information System (CCIS) on time spent charting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU: a review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "The introduction of a Critical Care Information System (CCIS) into an intensive care unit (ICU) is purported to reduce the time health care providers (HCP) spend on documentation and increase the time available for direct patient care. However, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research that has investigated these assertions. Moreover, those studies that have sought to elucidate the relationship between the introduction of a CCIS and the time spent by staff on in/direct patient care activities have published contradictory findings. The objective of this literature review is to establish the impact of a CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU. Five electronic databases were searched including PubMed Central, EMBASE, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Reference lists of all published papers were hand searched, and citations reviewed to identify extra papers. We included studies that were empirical articles, published in English, and provided original data on the impact of a CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU. In total, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. Workflow analysis (66%) and time-and-motion analysis (25%) were the most common forms of data collection. Three (25%) studies found an increase in time spent charting, five (42%) found no difference, and four (33%) studies reported a decrease. Results on the impact of a CCIS on direct patient care were similarly inconclusive. Due to the discrepant findings and several key methodological issues, the impact of a CCIS on time spent charting and in direct patient care remains unclear. This review highlights the need for an increase in rigorous empirical research in this area and provides recommendations for the design and implementation of future studies.",

    "abstract": "Clinical computing application development at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center has been limited by the lack of a flexible programming environment that supports multiple client user platforms. The World Wide Web offers a potential solution, with its multifunction servers, multiplatform clients, and use of standard protocols for displaying information. The authors are now using the Web, coupled with their own local clinical data server and vocabulary server, to carry out rapid prototype development of clinical information systems. They have developed one such prototype system that can be run on most popular computing platforms from anywhere on the Internet. The Web paradigm allows easy integration of clinical information with other local and Internet-based information sources. The Web also simplifies many aspects of application design; for example, it includes facilities for the use of encryption to meet the authors' security and confidentiality requirements. The prototype currently runs on only the Web server in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University, but it could be run on other Web servers that access the authors' clinical data and vocabulary servers. It could also be adapted to access clinical information from other systems with similar server capabilities. This approach may be adaptable for use in developing institution-independent standards for data and application sharing.",

    "abstract": "The role of pharmacists at primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Indonesia still needs long-term improvement. Enhancing interprofessional collaboration through data-driven collaboration is essential to strengthening cooperation. This study aimed to identify the need for an integrated information system to enhance the role of pharmacists at PHCs in Indonesia. A desk review was applied as the initial step to analyze the role of pharmacists at the PHCs in Indonesia. Furthermore, a qualitative study was conducted using Walt and Gilson's health policy analysis framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in four sections (context, content, process, and actors) with consideration of selected key respondents. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and then analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analyses, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the situation. We identified two significant challenges in optimizing the use of integrated systems at the PHCs to increase the role of pharmacists. Considering context-content-process-actors, implementing integrated pharmaceutical care standards relies significantly on human resources and infrastructures. Key challenges related to human resources are a limited number of human resources, a high workload, and insufficient use of working tools. We found several challenges regarding infrastructure, such as network connectivity issues, non-integrated systems or applications, and suboptimal benefits from the current systems. Various systems or applications in PHC involve reporting to the Ministry of Health, but detailed integration of these systems needs to be achieved immediately. According to informants, the criteria for desired applications are crucial to optimizing the integrated system, using it, and streamlining tasks for pharmacists at PHCs. Common expectations include an integrated system for monitoring drug usage and orders. Apart from usefulness, network connectivity must be assured for accessibility by all parties.",

    "abstract": "Dramatic advances in health information technologies necessitate a comprehensive evaluation framework covering all phases of development, from conception to routine operational use. The purpose of this article was to illustrate the application of an informatics evaluation framework that provides a heuristic for matching the stage of system design and the level of evaluation. An evaluation framework is illustrated in the context of five studies in different stages of system design. The studies discussed in this article represent the various stages of the framework. In addition, they are examples of how evaluation research studies not only contribute to the assessment of system design but also constitute distinct contributions to knowledge. The ability to engineer advanced information systems has exceeded the understanding of how to deploy them effectively in complex settings and to adapt them to a range of user populations. A systematic, continuous evaluation increases the likelihood that the conditions for success will be understood, including how to tailor a system, how to maintain the target population's use of the system, and how to innovate continually to enhance the functionality of the system and the users' experience. Without sound evaluation methodologies throughout the stages of system development, information systems have limited potential to influence healthcare processes positively.",

    "abstract": "The use of health-enabling technologies is regarded as one important means to face some of the challenges which accompany the demographic change with an expected rise in multi-morbidity and an increased need of care. A precondition for the sensible use of these technologies is their integration in existing information system structures, and - preferably - the enhancement of these into sensor-enhanced health information systems (seHIS). The aim of this review is to report on recent progress in seHIS, and thus to identify relevant areas of research that have to be addressed to provide patient-centered services in a semantically interoperable environment. A literature search in PubMed/Medline was combined with a manual search of papers (n = 1004) in three prominent health/medical informatics journals and one biomedical engineering journal starting from the year 2007. Despite a multitude of papers that present advanced systems using health-enabling technologies, only few papers could be identified that explicitly describe the design of seHIS or the integration of health-enabling technologies into health information systems. Recurring statements emphasise the importance of the following areas of research: patient-centered care using all available sources of information, data security, the stringent use of data representation and device connectivity standards, and adequate methods for data fusion and diagnostic analysis. There is a broad range of research in health-enabling technologies, often focused on specific diseases. The transition from current institution-centered health information systems to person-centered seHIS will be gradual, yet unavoidable for tapping the full potential of health-enabling technologies. seHIS is a growing field of research, and many ambitious challenges are still open. This literature review gives a brief outline of the most frequently mentioned research foci.",

Documentation and process improvements ascertained quality of services, operational support, occupational health and safety advice are the basics of the above applications. Communication and codified information among intersted parts is the other target of the survey regarding health issues. Computer networks can offer such services. The network will consist of certain nodes responsible to inform executives on Occupational Health and Safety. A web database has been installed for inserting and searching documents. The submission of files to a server and the answers to questionnaires through the web help the experts to perform their activities. Based on the requirements of enterprises we have constructed a web file server. We submit files so that users can retrieve the files which they need. The access is limited to authorized users. Digital watermarks authenticate and protect digital objects.",

To better understand this need, we identified likely PROMIS reporting formats, developed a multi-center clinical trial process model, and identified gaps between current capabilities and those necessary for PROMIS. These results were evaluated by key trial constituencies. Issues reported by principal investigators fell into two categories: acceptance by key regulators and the scientific community, and usability for researchers and clinicians. Issues reported by the coordinating center, participating sites, and study subjects were those faced when integrating new technologies into existing clinical trial systems. We then defined elements of a PROMIS Tool Kit required for integrating PROMIS into a multi-center clinical trial environment. The requirements identified in this study serve as a framework for future investigators in the design, development, implementation, and operation of PROMIS Tool Kit technologies.",

    "title": "Privacy Management and Networked PPD Systems - Challenges Solutions.",
    "abstract": "Modern personal portable health devices (PPDs) become increasingly part of a larger, inhomogeneous information system. Information collected by sensors are stored and processed in global clouds. Services are often free of charge, but at the same time service providers' business model is based on the disclosure of users' intimate health information. Health data processed in PPD networks is not regulated by health care specific legislation. In PPD networks, there is no guarantee that stakeholders share same ethical principles with the user. Often service providers have own security and privacy policies and they rarely offer to the user possibilities to define own, or adapt existing privacy policies. This all raises huge ethical and privacy concerns. In this paper, the authors have analyzed privacy challenges in PPD networks from users' viewpoint using system modeling method and propose the principle \"Personal Health Data under Personal Control\" must generally be accepted at global level. Among possible implementation of this principle, the authors propose encryption, computer understandable privacy policies, and privacy labels or trust based privacy management methods. The latter can be realized using infrastructural trust calculation and monitoring service. A first step is to require the protection of personal health information and the principle proposed being internationally mandatory. This requires both regulatory and standardization activities, and the availability of open and certified software application which all service providers can implement. One of those applications should be the independent Trust verifier.",

In view of the aged society, improved hygienic, medical, and welfare services must be provided in every community. In order to provide these services efficiently it is necessary to implement a community health care system (CHCS). The role and responsibilities of the medical information system, which is intended to support comprehensively the CHCS with respect to providing the necessary information, will become increasingly important. This paper is intended to discuss the structure, features, and required activities of the community medical information system which will have particular importance in the community health care services in the coming years. Problems in establishing and operating future medical information systems in the CHCS also are discussed. Lastly, problems and obstacles confronted when establishing and operating medical information systems in community health care which is organized around the medical association, which plays an important role and takes on heavy responsibility, are discussed, and a proposal is made.",

Therefore, it is necessary to identify and solve the usability problems of these systems. The present study aimed to evaluate the usability of a NIS using the cognitive walkthrough (CW) evaluation method. Based on five selected scenarios, five evaluators evaluated the NIS in Shafa Hospital Information System. After identifying the problems, the evaluators assigned each problem to one of the usability attributes. The severity of each identified problem was determined by the evaluators and five real users of the system. In total, 24 unique problems were identified. The average severity of the problems was determined by the evaluators (2.77) and the actual users (2.82) in the \"major problem\" category. The highest number of problems were assigned to the scenarios 3 and 2 with 15 and 14 problems, respectively. The highest average severity in terms of evaluations and actual users was related to the scenario 5 (3.06 and 2.94, respectively), which was in the \"major problem\" category. The highest number of problems were associated with learnability (8 problems) and efficiency (6 problems). Since most of the nurses do not have enough time for learning the system, and given that the selected scenarios for evaluation were based on the most frequent daily tasks that nurses performed using the NIS; The correction of usability problems in the scenarios 3 and 2 that had the highest number of problems and the scenario 5 that had the highest average severity and execution time; it can reduce the nurses' cognitive load and the learning time of the system and increase the efficiency of nurses.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of radiology departments are using computers to facilitate management of radiologic information. Transcription, storage, and printing of radiologic reports are among the primary functions of a radiology information system. Consequently, manual signature of radiologic reports is being replaced by on-line electronic authentication. However, the utilities provided on most radiology information systems to review, edit, and otherwise manipulate radiologic reports are relatively crude compared with commercial word-processing and data-base management software available for personal computers. We have developed a personal computer software system that is integrated with our existing radiology information system; expedites the radiologist's task of reviewing, editing, and authenticating (i.e., signing) radiologic reports; provides a teaching file data base on the workstation into which radiologic reports and patients' demographics can be instantly transferred; and provides a similar data base to facilitate follow-up on those examinations deemed appropriate for quality-assurance procedures. These features improve the radiologist's efficiency and increase his or her willingness to more fully exploit the intended purposes of a radiology information system.",

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalent use and advantages of information systems in hospitals, some have failed to meet their predefined objectives. Surgery information system (SIS) is a sub-system of a hospital information system. Its effective and efficient operation could enhance patient care in the busy environment of operating rooms with multiple tasks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SIS in three educational hospitals. Data were collected using a questionnaire completed by 82 users of SIS. This questionnaire contains three parts: 1) participants' demographic information, 2) questions regarding the efficiency of SIS, and 3) questions about its effectiveness. An independent sample t-test was used to compare the efficiency and effectiveness among systems. Chi-squared and Fisher tests were used to determine the relationship between the participants' demographics and efficiency and effectiveness as well as the relationship between efficiency and effectiveness. About 23% of the participants rated the system's efficiency as low, 29% as medium, and 48% as high. Besides, 24% of the participants considered the effectiveness of the system as low, 31% as medium, and 45% as high. There was a significant correlation between the efficiency and effectiveness of SIS (p ≤ 0.0001). Based on the perspective of most participants (44%)the efficiency and effectiveness of both surgery information systems were acceptable. The results suggest that these systems should be designed in a way that facilitate user's interaction and reduce the time takes to complete tasks. The results could be useful for developing and designing an efficient and effective system.",

    "abstract": "Health information systems offer many potential benefits for healthcare, including financial benefits and for improving the quality of patient care. The purpose of District Health Information Systems (DHIS) is to document data that are routinely collected in all public health facilities in a country using the system. The aim of this study was to examine the strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2, with a goal to enable decision makers in different counties to more accurately evaluate the outcomes of introducing DHIS2 into their particular country. A review of the literature combined with the method of meta-synthesis was used to source information and interpret results relating to the strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2. Databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for documents related to strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2, with no time limit up to 8 April 2017. The review and evaluation of selected studies was conducted in three stages: title, abstract and full text. Each of the selected studies was reviewed carefully and key concepts extracted. These key concepts were divided into two categories of strengths and operational challenges of DHIS2. Then, each category was grouped based on conceptual similarity to achieve the main themes and sub-themes. Content analysis was used to analyse extracted data. Of 766 identified citations, 20 studies from 11 countries were included and analysed in this study. Identified strengths in the DHIS were represented in seven themes (with 21 categories): technical features of software, proper management of data, application flexibility, networking and increasing the satisfaction of stakeholders, development of data management, increasing access to information and economic benefits. Operational challenges were identified and captured in 11 themes (with 18 categories): funds; appropriate communication infrastructure; the need for the existence of appropriate data; political, cultural, social and structural infrastructure; manpower; senior managers; training; using academic potentials; definition and standardising the deployment processes; neglect to application of criteria and clinical guidelines in the use of system; data security; stakeholder communications challenges and the necessity to establish a pilot system. This study highlighted specific strengths in the technical and functional aspects of DHIS2 and also drew attention to particular challenges and concerns. These results provide a sound evidence base for decision makers and policymakers to enable them to make more accurate decisions about whether or not to use the DHIS2 in the health system of their country.",

The system, called URIS, has facilitated the management of research data in an academic urological department. It enables end-users, who are not necessarily skilled computer scientists, to design their own databases semi-automatically, by supporting data entry screen design and the specification of research items. The system creates the database tables automatically after these activities. The specification of research items is the most important but also most difficult part in this process.",

    "abstract": "Currently many healthcare systems are supported by an increasing set of Health Information Sys-tems (HISs), which assist the activities for multiple stakeholders. The literature on HISs is, however, fragmented and a solid overview of the current state of HISs is missing. This impedes the understanding and characterization of the required HISs for the healthcare domain. In this article, we present the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that identifies the HISs, their domains, stakeholders, features, and obstacles. In the SLR, we identified 1340 papers from which we selected 136 studies, on which we performed a full-text analysis. After the synthesis of the data, we were able to report on 33 different domains, 41 stakeholders, 73 features, and 69 obstacles. We discussed how these domains, features, and obstacles interact with each other and presented suggestions to overcome the identified obstacles. We recognized five groups of obstacles: technical problems, operational functionality, maintenance & support, usage problems, and quality problems. Obstacles from all groups require to be solved to pave the way for further research and application of HISs. This study shows that there is a plentitude of HISs with unique features and that there is no consensus on the requirements and types of HISs in the literature.",

We describe the shortcomings and inefficiencies inherent in this current process and introduce two national initiatives that attempt to unite these communities. The mission of these two initiatives is to create examples of unambiguous, decidable, and executable clinical guidelines which both utilize and inform HIT terminology and logical expression standards.

To support cooperative work in medical care, computer technology should both augment the capabilities of individual specialists and enhance their ability of interacting with each other and with computational resources. Thus, a major shift is needed from centralized first generation health-care information systems to distributed environments composed of several interconnected agents, cooperating in maintaining a full track of the patient clinical history and supporting health-care providers in all the phases of the patient-management process. This paper outlines a general methodology to make architectural choices while designing or integrating new software components into a distributed health-care information system. A particular stress is laid on the specification of shared conceptual models, or ontologies, providing agents committing to them with the common semantic foundation required for effective interoperation.",

    "abstract": "Medical records contain enormous amounts of data. It is important to extract useful evidence from such data and feedback to clinical medicine. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was introduced in the 1990s and has been widely used for more than 20 years, however, hospital information system environments that take advantage of the ideas of EBM have not yet been established. Recently, the numbers of medical institutions with multilateral search systems for the medical records stored in data warehouses (DWHs) have been increasing, but these institutions' systems cannot deal fully with issues such as data reliability and high-dimensional, high-speed searches. DWHs can control long time-series data. Although, the measurement methods and analytical equipment used have been modified and improved with advances in testing techniques, this may have induced shifting and/or fragmentation of these types of data. Furthermore, database design has to be flexible to satisfy the various demands of information retrieval; systems must therefore have the structures to deal with such demands. We report here our new system infrastructure, which exchanges data in order to absorb the data shifting associated with changes in the testing methods. The system enables the preparation of DWH environments that can be used to seamlessly analyze long time-series data, record in knowledge databases the results of comprehensive analyses of institutions' characteristics of laboratory diagnoses, and use the data in education, research and clinical practice.",

To this end, IT managers and GPs were interviewed. The usage of hospital information systems (HIS) and data warehouse systems (DWS) in hospitals is of major importance for the study. Over 90 % use DWS for administration, 42 % for clinical research. None of the hospitals implemented consent for the use of routine data for research. Only a third of the GPs have participated in studies. The GPs' offices based EHR systems in use offer virtually no support for research projects. The study results demonstrate that technical and organisational measures are required for the further usage of routine data in the region.",

We applied a structured literature research by searching for \"mental workload\" on PubMed. Studies were included into our review if they assessed related to Health Information Systems. The research in PubMed led to 124 articles, resulting in 17 papers taken into in-depth analyses. We identified three categories referring to different study design types. Additionally, articles showed that mental workload was influenced by using health information systems and vice versa. The review was limited to only one database but revealed that future research with sociotechnical focus including mental workload is necessary. In contrast to the high relevance only a few articles address mental workload in Health Information systems. The quality of the studies in terms of evidence and external validity appears to be largely in need of development and should be improved in ongoing research.",

HIS has the potential to improve individuals' health and providers' performance by producing better quality, cost savings, and greater patient involvement in their own health. There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels. Through a state-of-the-art review of HIS, focused on their maturity state, we identify and characterize a set of critical factors recognized as determinants in the context of HIS maturity. The article identifies a broad spectrum of MM applied to the health sector and its characteristics and reinforces the belief that the maturity of HIS can contribute to the quality of information and knowledge management in the sector.",

The purpose of this system is to help students understanding a hospital information system from actual experience. The characteristics of this system are as follows: 1) Students can easily learn a hospital information system on the Web pages in the computer training room. 2) The present system is not as complete as a hospital information system, however, helpful explanations regarding the data processing have been inserted. 3) The fictional patient data have been prepared for the pages relating to the electronic medical chart. Consequently, students can understand what kind of data has been saved in this system. Through a questionnaire, students evaluated this system in terms of understandability. The result from four years between 1999 and 2002 showed that 70% of them evaluated it as good system. We therefore consider this system to be effective over a short period of time, and useful for medical education.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between local health departments' (LHDs') governance structures and their use of information systems (IS) and information technologies (IT). As the US health system moves toward more integrated models of delivering care, LHDs have been identified as key nexus for information exchange. Therefore, understanding how LHDs' governance facilitates or inhibits the adoption and use of such IS and IT tools is critical. The 2008 survey of the National Association of County and City Health Officials' members included a set of questions dedicated to the use of IS/IT and its relationship to governance structures. Ordinal logistic and Poisson regressions are used to identify significant relationships among the variables. The survey sample's results (n = 473) are extended to the national sample (N = 2794) using the variable weightings included in the study design. The 2 dependent variables examined are IS and IT use. The IS variable captures the software and analytic tools used in LHDs. The IT measure primarily captures hardware and infrastructure capabilities. Overall, the use of IS/IT by LHDs is low. Generally, LHDs that have shared governance structures with other state and community bodies tended to have greater IS/IT use. Similarly, larger LHDs with leaders that have higher educational levels used IS/IT in greater amounts. With their current IS/IT capability levels, LHDs will struggle to play a meaningful role in the integration and exchange of health information. Given that LHD also serve at-risk populations in disproportionate numbers, this digital divide may become a real divide in the access to high quality care for some communities.",

It used a high-speed dedicated optical fibre distributed data interface network and for teleradiology an Integrated Services Digital Network solution. Image and other data were captured and archived satisfactorily. Image reporting folders were manually constructed and sent to reporting viewstations. Radiologists were able to directly request 'ad hoc' images from archive. The reporting function of the associated but unlinked radiology information system was satisfactory. Identification was made of data transfer, ergonomic, single point of failure and many other issues. These informed re-specification and the commercial approach for a Digital Images Communication in Medicine/Hyper Text Mark-up Language Picture Archiving and Communication System, the first stages of which have been whole hospital re-networking, Intranet introduction, installation of new Computed Radiography/Fluorography and Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging segments and a new Radiology Information System. The Picture Archiving and Communication System is now seen as part of a full Electronic Patient Record system. Networking and provision of high quality Personal Computer hardware for data review are seen as a corporate responsibility and a hospital overhead, no longer borne by individual projects. Our present work is synergistic with the procurement of a new Clinical Information System and the further development of the hospital Intranet.",

    "abstract": "Medication errors have been identified as one of the most important causes of adverse drug events. Computerized physician order-entry (CPOE) systems, coupled with decision support (Medication allergy checking, drug interactions, and dose calculations), are considered to be appropriate solutions for reducing medication errors and standardizing care. It is quite useful if clinical information system (CIS) supports order sets, which help with standardizing care, preventing omission errors, and expediting the ordering process. Order sets are predefined groups of orders pertinent to one or more specific clinical conditions or diagnoses. The article describes how a clinical information system can be used to support medication process (prescribing, ordering, dispensing, administration and monitoring) and offer participating medical teams real time warnings and key information regarding medications and patient status, thus reducing medication errors. Integrated electronic prescribing support system benefits for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are discussed at the end.",

    "abstract": "Efficient search for and finding drugs is essential for electronic drug information systems which, for their part, are prerequisites for computerized physician order entry systems and clinical decision support with the potential to prevent medication errors. Search failures would be critical: they may delay or even prohibit prescription processes or timely retrieval of vital drug information. We analyzed spelling-correction and error characteristics in drug searches and the suitability of auto-completion as prevention strategy. A blank entry field was presented to the user for unbiased queries in a web-based drug information system containing >105,000 brand names and active ingredients accessible from all 5500 computers of the Heidelberg University Hospital. The system was equipped with an error-tolerant search. Misspelled but found drug names confirmed by users were aligned by dynamic programming algorithms, opposing misspelled and correct names letter by letter. We analyzed the ratios of correctly and incorrectly spelled but found drugs, frequencies of characters, and their position in misspelled search words. Without error-tolerant search, no results were found in 17.5% of all queries. Users confirmed 31% of all results found with phonetic error-correction support. Sixteen percent of all spelling errors were letters in close proximity to the correct letter on keyboards. On average, 7% of the initial letters in misspelled words contained errors. Drug information systems should be equipped with error-tolerant algorithms to reduce search failures. Drug initial letters are also error-prone, thus auto-completion is not a sufficient error-prevention strategy and needs additional support by error-tolerant algorithms.",

Analyses of the coded data allow for more effective management of social work services and permit social work departments to compete for scarce resources, to comply with external regulations and accountability demands, and to assure quality service. In addition they provide a firm data base for research. The problem and service categories were tested for reliability by comparing the independent categorizations of 159 and 154 cases respectively by six social work persons, two each at three different levels of experience. Reliability levels were found to be satisfactory. The development of this system and the method of reliability testing are described and believed to be applicable to other systems.",

    "abstract": "Today, at the era of information technologies Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have organized action for creation of standardized Computer-Based Information Systems (CBISs) in health. These CBISs would enable collection of defined and comparable data and therefore ensure adequate analysis, observation and decision making on a local community level as well on the general level of health information system. Thanks to enthusiasts, local CBISs are created in health care facilities. Those individual local CBISs have similar solutions based on the experience of previous good functioning. Therefore, we can expect that a standardized state CBIS will be formed with the minimal focused action of people in charge. The Zavidovici Medical Center has a CBIS which has been working long enough so that we can analyze the results of usage of such an information system. The system has a modular character, oriented on analysis and documentation of data, and on support for management and decision-making functions. Analyzing the results reached by implementation of such a CBIS, we can conclude that we have achieved better results in patient administration and work organization and that we have less patients in dispensary of primary health care by 20%, shorter time in treatment of patients by 7%, reduced consumption of essential medicines by 8%, costs of treatment in medical facilities are down by 5% and patients have more a positive view toward the services provided now than they had earlier. Moreover, substantial savings in radio and laboratory diagnostics procedures have been achieved by reducing time for doing lab reports, savings in materials and through minimizing human error.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Sources of immunization data include state registries or immunization information systems (IIS), medical records, and surveys. Little is known about the quality of these data sources or the feasibility of using IIS data for research. We assessed the feasibility of collecting immunization information for a national children's health study by accessing existing IIS data and comparing the completeness of these data against medical record abstractions (MRA) and parent report. Staff time needed to obtain IIS and MRA data was assessed. Methods We administered a questionnaire to state-level IIS representatives to ascertain availability and completeness of their data for research and gather information about data formats. We evaluated quality of data from IIS, medical records, and reports from parents of 119 National Children's Study participants at three locations. Results IIS data were comparable to MRA data and both were more complete than parental report. Agreement between IIS and MRA data was greater than between parental report and MRA, suggesting IIS and MRA are better sources than parental report. Obtaining IIS data took less staff time than chart review, making IIS data linkage for research a preferred choice. Conclusions IIS survey results indicate data can be obtained by researchers using data linkages. IIS are an accessible and feasible child immunization information source and these registries reduce reliance on parental report or medical record abstraction. Researchers seeking to link IIS data with large multi-site studies should consider acquiring IIS data, but may need strategies to overcome barriers to data completeness and linkage.",

    "title": "Data-driven knowledge acquisition, validation, and transformation into HL7 Arden Syntax.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to help a team of physicians and knowledge engineers acquire clinical knowledge from existing practices datasets for treatment of head and neck cancer, to validate the knowledge against published guidelines, to create refined rules, and to incorporate these rules into clinical workflow for clinical decision support. A team of physicians (clinical domain experts) and knowledge engineers adapt an approach for modeling existing treatment practices into final executable clinical models. For initial work, the oral cavity is selected as the candidate target area for the creation of rules covering a treatment plan for cancer. The final executable model is presented in HL7 Arden Syntax, which helps the clinical knowledge be shared among organizations. We use a data-driven knowledge acquisition approach based on analysis of real patient datasets to generate a predictive model (PM). The PM is converted into a refined-clinical knowledge model (R-CKM), which follows a rigorous validation process. The validation process uses a clinical knowledge model (CKM), which provides the basis for defining underlying validation criteria. The R-CKM is converted into a set of medical logic modules (MLMs) and is evaluated using real patient data from a hospital information system. We selected the oral cavity as the intended site for derivation of all related clinical rules for possible associated treatment plans. A team of physicians analyzed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the oral cavity and created a common CKM. Among the decision tree algorithms, chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) was applied to a refined dataset of 1229 patients to generate the PM. The PM was tested on a disjoint dataset of 739 patients, which gives 59.0% accuracy. Using a rigorous validation process, the R-CKM was created from the PM as the final model, after conforming to the CKM. The R-CKM was converted into four candidate MLMs, and was used to evaluate real data from 739 patients, yielding efficient performance with 53.0% accuracy. Data-driven knowledge acquisition and validation against published guidelines were used to help a team of physicians and knowledge engineers create executable clinical knowledge. The advantages of the R-CKM are twofold: it reflects real practices and conforms to standard guidelines, while providing optimal accuracy comparable to that of a PM. The proposed approach yields better insight into the steps of knowledge acquisition and enhances collaboration efforts of the team of physicians and knowledge engineers.",

As conclusion, we found the methods to analyze levels of security requirements for each medical information systems employing FTA, basic events for each composition factor and combination of basic events. Methods for searching suitable security measures were found. Namely risk factors for each basic event, number of elements for each composition factor and candidates of security measure elements were found.

Namely optimum distribution of risk factors in terms of basic events were figured out, and comparison of them between each medical information systems became possible.",

The implementation of viable Health Data Networks within hospitals and subsequent connection to the GP's desktop PC enables increased access to patient records, decision-support and communication with experts around the world To address the high usage of expensive health services and lengthy waiting lists health services around the world are embracing programs such as Community, Coordinated, Shared and Managed care. This focus on coordination of care and increased emphasis on evidenced-based medicine is greatly enhanced through the advent of viable health data networks. Other resources such as databases, best-practice guidelines, the web, email, telemedicine and a range of commercial programs that provide further services has created an overload of resources available to the GP. Current human-computer interface guidelines are not adequate for prescribing design solutions to deal with the information overload facing GPs. The challenge for the near future is to present the vast array of information sources to the GP in an acceptable and useable information system interface. Part of the solution may revolve around the development of standards for Electronic Health Record systems for GPs, as is being done currently in Australia; but we suspect that less mainstream interface technologies will be required to exploit the wealth of available healthcare information.",

We validated the ACAS by calculating the level of agreement in patient identification with data generated from manual identification methods. There was substantial agreement between the two methods both for clinical trial (kappa:0.84) and billing (kappa:0.97). Automated identification occurred instantaneously vs. about 2 hours/day for clinical trial and 1 hour 10 minutes/day for billing, and was inexpensive ($98.95, one time fee) compared to manual identification ($1,200/month for clinical trial and $670/month for billing). Automated identification was more efficient and cost-effective than manual identification methods. Repurposing clinical information beyond their traditional use has the potential to improve efficiency and decrease healthcare cost.",

The systems were assessed by analysing the core activities of surveillance and response and support functions (provision of training, supervision, and resources). Data were collected using questionnaires that involved both interviews and observations at regional, district, and health facility levels in three of the 20 regions in the United Republic of Tanzania. An HMIS was found at 26 of 32 health facilities (81%) surveyed and at all 14 regional and district medical offices. The four other surveillance systems were found at <20% of health facilities and <75% of medical offices. Standardized case definitions were used for only 3 of 21 infectious diseases. Nineteen (73%) health facilities with HMIS had adequate supplies of forms; 9 (35%) reported on time; and 11 (42%) received supervision or feedback. Four (29%) medical offices with HMIS had population denominators to use for data analyses; 12 (86%) were involved in outbreak investigations; and 11 (79%) had conducted community prevention activities. While HMIS could serve as the backbone for IDSR in the United Republic of Tanzania, this will require supervision, standardized case definitions, and improvements in the quality of reporting, analysis, and feedback.",

    "title": "What can information systems do for primary health care? An international perspective.",
    "abstract": "The reform of health information systems has been made a priority by health managers, public health specialists and technocrats. While each of these groups has promised major benefits from improvements in information systems, insufficient attention has been paid to the limitations placed upon the theoretical possibilities of information technology by the characteristics of the health system of which the information system is but a part. Managers anticipate improved efficiency and rational allocation of resources, but rational decision making does not automatically follow from improvements in information. Epidemiologists and public health specialists seek more effective and equitable health systems but methodological problems and the expense of many conventional epidemiological approaches continue to limit the usefulness of disease surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation. Both managers and epidemiologists are confronted with the conflicts which arise in seeking to create locally sensitive information systems within centralised health systems. Technocrats see microcomputers as essential for information systems to be truly effective and as a means of liberating health workers from the drudgery of form filling. However, the rate of organisational evolution in the health system has not kept pace with the rapid development of information technology. There are good prospects for considerable health gain to be wrought from reforms in health information systems but to realise these it is necessary that this process be 'action-led' rather than, as is conventional, 'data-led'. The latter approach sees data as the end in itself; the 'action-led' approach, in contrast, regards information as needs to interventions with a focus on how information will influence decisions. For improvements in information to result in improved health, strategies must be adopted which will ensure that information routinely informs decisions and is seen as a means to the end of improving health.",

The appearance of the computer-based information technology has initiated the possibility to significantly ease these routine activities and enable the medical staff to devote more time to enhanced creative work. However, only when medical staff can use computers reliably, effectively, democratically, easily, and in natural, intuitive fashion, medical information system (MIS) will be used enthusiastically and favourably. In that manner special attention must be dedicated to MIS design. The aim of our paper is to introduce the new (M)IS design approach called metaparadigm and show its applicability to MIS design. A metaparadigm is a holistic, participative and systemic approach, incorporating design activities needed to construct both the (M)IS design paradigm and the selected (M)IS. It is our deepest belief that metaparadigms employment can enhance many IS design weaknesses and result in the successful medical information systems design and use.",

    "title": "The modern CIO: forging a new role in the managed care era.",
    "abstract": "The advent of managed care has helped forge new roles for healthcare professionals. Competitive pressures, the profile of the member community, and provider network design drive healthcare delivery via the managed care model. Careful analysis and design of the managed care model charts the success or failure of the health care delivery system--usually an integrated delivery system (IDS). Therefore, those healthcare organizations that have chosen to get on the managed care bandwagon must re-invent themselves, both culturally and technologically. The chief information officer (CIO) leads this technological revolution. To work effectively, the technological infrastructure of the IDS must be closely in line with enterprise goals and objectives. In the managed care environment the old information system (IS) approach of supporting the operational needs of individual departments simply will not work. The CIO's new role will be to master the concept of managed care to ensure that enterprise-wide needs for operational, clinical, and financial information are met, and that IS and enterprise goals are aligned. CIOs who have an intuitive grasp of the managed care environment--although their numbers are growing as managed care mushrooms--make up a minority group. They are a special breed with clearly definable qualities such as business savvy and an affinity for big-picture thinking. To an IDS, a CIO with these qualities is a rare gem indeed. This article introduces Don Winschel, the associate administrator and CIO of Johnson City Medical Center (Johnson City, TN) as an example of one such modern CIO.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the coverage, validity and reliability of Brazil's Information System on Live Births (SINASC) for birth defects in a hospital in the city of Campinas (São Paulo State). The study population consisted of 2,823 newborn infants delivered in 2004 at the Women's Integrated Health Care Center (CAISM). A birth defect registry (ECLAMC) was used as the gold-standard. All birth defect cases reported at CAISM in 2004 (92 cases) were selected from SINASC data files. All 168 birth defect cases from the same city and year registered at ECLAMC were also retrieved. An underreporting of 46.8% was observed for all birth defects, and 36.4% when considering only the major birth defects. The ascertained sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 54.2% and 99.8%. The reliability of three and four-digit ICD-10 coding for birth defects was 0.77 and 0.55 respectively (kappa statistic). These results suggest that information provided by birth certificates in Campinas still presents limitations when seeking to ascertain accurate estimates of the prevalence of birth defects, hence indicating the need for improvements in the SINASC database to enable it to portray birth defect prevalence at birth in this city.",

Interoperability is one of the privileged ways to improve the integration of different systems because nowadays a HIS is no longer just a single monolithic software system, which is run on a single machine. This paper presents a semantic interoperability architecture, which is based on a mediation approach.

    "title": "Kenya's health workforce information system: a model of impact on strategic human resources policy, planning and management.",
    "abstract": "Countries worldwide are challenged by health worker shortages, skill mix imbalances, and maldistribution. Human resources information systems (HRIS) are used to monitor and address these health workforce issues, but global understanding of such systems is minimal and baseline information regarding their scope and capability is practically non-existent. The Kenya Health Workforce Information System (KHWIS) has been identified as a promising example of a functioning HRIS. The objective of this paper is to document the impact of KHWIS data on human resources policy, planning and management. Sources for this study included semi-structured interviews with senior officials at Kenya's Ministry of Medical Services (MOMS), Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MOPHS), the Department of Nursing within MOMS, the Nursing Council of Kenya, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, Kenya's Clinical Officers Council, and Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board. Additionally, quantitative data were extracted from KHWIS databases to supplement the interviews. Health sector policy documents were retrieved from MOMS and MOPHS websites, and reviewed to assess whether they documented any changes to policy and practice as having been impacted by KHWIS data. Interviews with Kenyan government and regulatory officials cited health workforce data provided by KHWIS influenced policy, regulation, and management. Policy changes include extension of Kenya's age of mandatory civil service retirement from 55 to 60 years. Data retrieved from KHWIS document increased relicensing of professional nurses, midwives, medical practitioners and dentists, and interviewees reported this improved compliance raised professional regulatory body revenues. The review of Government records revealed few references to KHWIS; however, documentation specifically cited the KHWIS as having improved the availability of human resources for health information regarding workforce planning, management, and development. KHWIS data have impacted a range of improvements in health worker regulation, human resources management, and workforce policy and planning at Kenya's ministries of health.",

    "abstract": "A conceptual model of a health care structure is described. The management of protocols viewed as structured, flexible, and coherent descriptions of activities aimed to solve specific problems in the system is the kernel of the model. A global approach to the protocols is proposed. Each protocol is modeled from two points of view: the nature of the actions (clinical, administrative, programming, and control) and the life cycle of protocols (theoretical, customized, and performed). In our approach the patient folder not only records information about the patient, but also contains and controls the execution of the protocols planned to be performed on the patient. As a consequence, all aspects related to protocol execution are chronologically reported in the folder in a federated manner. In this way the patient folder becomes a complex, multifaceted object, able to capture all information needed to evaluate the patient evolution in a given period.",

Telenurses use health information systems (HIS) as their main source of health information in order to assist callers with their health related concerns on the telephone. In order to ensure that the telenurse-caller encounter supports a safe, appropriate and patient focused outcome, it was important to evaluate the usability of (HIS) that telenurses use. The purpose of this paper is to describe usability issues that emerged during a clinical simulation study of nurses working in a call centre. Clinical simulation was thus chosen as the most comprehensive methodology in this study and its benefits will be discussed.",

    "title": "Proposal for tuberculosis death surveillance in information systems.",
    "abstract": "To propose a tuberculosis-related death surveillance strategy based on the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Data on 55 tuberculosis-related deaths, which occurred in two large hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, between September 2005 and August 2006, were obtained from the SIM. These cases were searched and compared with cases in the National Notification System (Sinan). The increment in the number of notifications and completeness of data were evaluated, as well as entry type and outcome in Sinan. Of the 55 deaths, 28 were registered in Sinan. Comparison between systems allowed for the following corrections: 27 new cases were notified, 14 new notifications performed by the hospitals where death occurred and ten outcomes corrected. This represented an increment of 41/144 (28%) notifications by these two hospitals in 2006. Nine cases, previously classified as unconfirmed tuberculosis were reclassified as bacteriologically confirmed, and another five cases were reclassified from tuberculosis to AIDS as the primary cause of death. The proposed surveillance system for tuberculosis-related death was useful to increase data completeness, decrease under-notification and cases with unknown outcome, to evaluate epidemiological surveillance and death certificate quality and to trace previously unidentified contacts.",

A fully integrated database system was implemented in this tertiary-care university hospital. Terminals are available in the patient-care areas, order entry is uncomplicated, and typing is not necessary. When entering medication orders, the physician can select screens that display either general-order or specialty-order sets that are similar to preprinted-order sheets. A program was developed by the pharmacy and nursing departments to help the physicians learn to use the computer system and to demonstrate its benefits. Physicians were offered a training program that could be taken in one six-hour session or as six one-hour segments. Pharmacy technicians were trained to assist physicians with order entry in the patient-care areas during the implementation phase. Hospital policy requires that orders not personally entered by the physician must be written by hand in the patient chart and reviewed and entered in the computer system by a pharmacist before being dispensed. The delays inherent in this procedure give physicians an incentive to use the terminals. The policy encouraging direct order entry by physicians has been broadly accepted and has enabled the hospital to standardize drug therapy ordering and encourage adherence to the formulary.",

An \"electronic questionnaire\" in the form of an interrogation questionnaire was used to extract a subset of data from practice computers running a standard software package (the general practice administrative system for Scotland, GPASS). The data were retained by each practice and also collected and analysed centrally to produce regional and national data. All 257 general practices in Scotland using GPASS software were sent the electronic questionnaire; data from 154 practices, including 759 general practitioners and covering 1,010,452 patients, were collected. Ninety three practices had all their patient records on computer; others had selectively entered data on, for example, only those patients receiving repeat prescriptions. The number of computerised patient records per practitioner ranged from 46 to 2373. Altogether 194,261 patients had repeat prescribing data and 204,005 morbidity or clinical data. An electronic questionnaire is a simple and effective way of investigating the information held on practice computers, allowing analysis and feedback of information to practitioners. Development of this system will provide a cumulative information system for Scottish general practitioners.",

    "title": "Cell/tissue processing information system for regenerative medicine.",
    "abstract": "When conducting clinical studies of regenerative medicine, compliance to good manufacturing practice (GMP) is mandatory, and thus much time is needed for manufacturing and quality management. It is therefore desired to introduce the manufacturing execution system (MES), which is being adopted by factories manufacturing pharmaceutical products. Meanwhile, in manufacturing human cell/tissue processing autologous products, it is necessary to protect patients' personal information, prevent patients from being identified and obtain information for cell/tissue identification. We therefore considered it difficult to adopt conventional MES to regenerative medicine-related clinical trials, and so developed novel software for production/quality management to be used in cell-processing centres (CPCs), conforming to GMP. Since this system satisfies the requirements of regulations in Japan and the USA for electronic records and electronic signatures (ER/ES), the use of ER/ES has been allowed, and the risk of contamination resulting from the use of recording paper has been eliminated, thanks to paperless operations within the CPC. Moreover, to reduce the risk of mix-up and cross-contamination due to contact during production, we developed a touchless input device with built-in radio frequency identification (RFID) reader-writer devices and optical sensors. The use of this system reduced the time to prepare and issue manufacturing instructions by 50% or more, compared to the conventional handwritten system. The system contributes to producing more large-scale production and to reducing production costs for cell and tissue products in regenerative medicine. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

We have installed some hierarchical, textual database systems on the same computer that runs our radiology information system. Several different databases are maintained, including protocol manuals, emergency procedures, and a directory of telephone and pager numbers. This information is accessible from any terminal connected to our radiology information system and from any personal computer connected to our department's local area network or terminal server. Advantages include decreased costs from the photocopying, consumption, and distribution of paper; ubiquitous access for all users to a single source of information; faster and more powerful ways to access data than paper-based media provide; decreased risk of inadvertently using information from an obsolete document; and convenience in maintaining computerized versus paper-based information. Because we use software that is either free or that came with our computer's operating system, no additional software costs were involved.",

Many other actors are also involved with these processes, both on the administrative side, such as registration officers, administrators and on the clinical side, nurses and other care providers. Applications have been developed within hospital information systems for capturing and disseminating information according to these specific actors and dedicated purposes. But more and more appears the need to integrate these data for insuring the coherence of information and avoiding redundancy of data capture. How to conciliate these objectives?

Articles related to the epidemiology of injury, population survey, and letters to the editor were excluded, while the review and research articles related to ISISs were included in the study. Initially 324 articles were identified, and finally 22 studies were selected for review. Having reviewed the articles, the data needed were extracted and the results were synthesized narratively. The results showed that most of the systems reviewed in this study used the minimum data set suggested by the World Health Organization injury surveillance guidelines along with supplementary data. The main functions considered for the system were injury track, data analysis, report, data linkage, electronic monitoring and data dissemination. ISISs can help to improve healthcare planning and injury prevention.

This paper aims to describe and give an overview of the possibilities and potential uses of a Geographical Information System (GIS) in the field of surveillance and monitoring of animal diseases. The following areas in which GIS and special GIS-functions could be incorporated are presented: recording and reporting information, epidemic emergency, cluster analysis, modelling disease spread, and planning control strategies. Different sources of data; geographical data, farm locations and disease information, used in the development of the GIS at the National Veterinary Institute in Norway are thoroughly described in the paper. Further, it presents a few examples where the GIS has been applied to studies of epidemiology and surveillance of animal diseases in Norway, which shows the significant value of GIS in these areas. At the same time, the incorporation of GIS in this field shows the scarcity of the data available, which should encourage improvement in the data recording and the quality of the registries.",

VFC is an entitlement program providing free vaccine to eligible children. We timed the staff of the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) and 72 private VFC practices for administrative VFC-related tasks from September 2003 through March 2004. Time measurements included time for practices to produce VFC reports and for UDOH staff to assess practice coverage levels and process VFC reports manually or via the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS). Median cost savings to the state health department could be as much as $11 740 annually. Utah VFC practices could save up to a maximum of $446 annually per practice by using USIIS for VFC tasks. If applied to the 218 enrolled private practices statewide, this would result in a median total cost savings of $17,615 ($15,519 for reports and $2,096 for pulling medical charts).",

Informed by socio-technical systems (STS) theory, AR was used to design an intervention to enhance an existing patient administration system (PAS) to enable data entries in real time while contributing to the literature. The study analyzed qualitative data collected through interviews, participant observations, and document reviews. The study found that the design of the PAS was unsuitable to the work of the three units of the OTD. Based on the diagnoses and STS theory, the project developed and implemented a successful intervention to enhance the legacy system for data entries in real time. The study demonstrates the value of AR from a socio-technical perspective for improving existing systems in healthcare settings. The steps adopted in this study could be applied to improve similar systems. A follow-up study will be essential to assess the sustainability of the improved system.",

The central role assigned to primary care in conceptual frameworks clashes with the severe limitations in the quality and availability of the data required to construct the indicators. The lack of systematic and standardized databases covering diagnosis, procedures and intermediate results in individual patients is endemic across countries. Filling this gap has become a priority in most countries, especially during the last decade. In Spain, the concept of the Primary Care Information System appeared in 2003 and the first data/results were published in 2006. Since then, distinct elements have been progressively incorporated with the involvement of the various autonomous regions in Spain. Currently, the system includes various aspects such as the population assigned, the available resources, a national catalogue of primary care centers, and activity. The next challenge in this work in progress is to build a database of clinical information.",

However, almost no information system has been developed which links hospitals and clinics. Medical care and welfare services are still separated activities and there are no information systems which exchange the data between the two sectors. Emergency medical information systems have been developed in the past, but they are usually used only for the exchange of bed occupancy information. Doctors started using the Internet, but there have been few medical books in Japanese in cyber space. Initiatives of medical personnel who are engaged in the daily health care delivery are necessary to solve the above stated problems. Some promising systems are emerging by the efforts of pioneers. Administrative agencies should assist the efforts of these initiatives to improve the community health care delivery. In the near future, the information systems will have some influence on the shape of medical care. Patient's medical data will be disclosed to patients. Specialty of hospitals will be also disclosed to the public. As a result, doctors will start to seek for more objective evidence for their medical care to patients. Clinical practice guidelines will be produced for common diseases in Japan as in Europe. Hospitals will cooperate with each other in the delivery of care, because it will be impossible for one hospital to give all types of care to patients. Hospitals in a community will function as if a virtually single hospital even though they are different in management.",

A significantly shorter LOS was found between patients whose information was available and was communicated effectively in comparison to patients whose data were not available. Furthermore, longer LOS was associated with patients who required clinical services (pathology, radiology) due to the manual retrieval of results. This study has found that future implementation of a comprehensive electronic information system will facilitate effective communication workflow and timely access to patient data in the emergency department.",

Authenticated key agreement protocol is very important for protecting the security in TMIS. Recently scholars have proposed a lot of authenticated key agreement protocols. In 2016, Chiou et al. demonstrated that Chen et al.'s authentication scheme fails to provide user's anonymity and message authentication and then proposed an enhanced scheme (Chiou et al., J. Med. Syst. 40(4):1-15, 2006) to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that Chiou et al.'s scheme is defenseless against key compromise impersonation (KCI) attack and also fails to provide forward security. Moreover, we propose a novel authentication scheme namely ICASME to overcome the mentioned weaknesses in this paper. Security analyses show that ICASME achieves the forward security and KCI attack resistance. In addition, it is proved that the time taken to implement the ICASME is not intolerable compared to the original protocol.",

Using the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) tool that assumes relationships between technical, behavioural and organizational determinants of the routine information processes and performance, this paper highlights some behavioural factors affecting the quality of routinely collected data in South Africa. In the context of monitoring maternal and child health programmes, data were collected from 161 health information personnel in 58 health facilities and 2 district offices from 2 conveniently sampled health districts. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess confidence and competence levels of routine health information system (RHIS) tasks, problem solving anddata quality checking skills, and motivation. The findings suggest that 64% of the respondents have poor numerical skills and limited statistical and data quality checking skills. While the average confidence levels at performing RHIS tasks is 69%, only 22% actually displayed competence above 50%. Personnel appear to be reasonably motivated but there is considerable deficiency in their competency to interpret and use data. This may undermine the quality and utility of the RHIS.",

The comparisons were conducted using equivalence testing with weights created for PROMIS by raking. The weighted PROMIS population and subsample had similar demographics compared with the 2000 U.S. Census, except that the subsample had a higher percentage of people with higher education than high school. Equivalence testing shows similarity between PROMIS general population and national norms with regard to body mass index, EQ-5D health index (EuroQol group defined descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and self-rating of general health. Self-rated health of the PROMIS general population is similar to that of existing samples from the general U.S. population. The weighted PROMIS general population is more comparable to national norms than the unweighted population with regard to subject characteristics. The findings suggest that the representativeness of the Internet data is comparable to those from probability-based general population samples.",

A software framework is described for developing such a system within a distributed architecture that includes spatial and symbolic anatomy information resources, Web and custom servers, and authoring and end-user client programs. The authoring tools have been used to create 3-D atlases of the brain, knee and thorax that are used both locally and throughout the world. For the one and a half year period from June 1995-January 1997, the on-line atlases were accessed by over 33,000 sites from 94 countries, with an average of over 4000 \"hits\" per day, and 25,000 hits per day during peak exam periods. The atlases have been linked to by over 500 sites, and have received at least six unsolicited awards by outside rating institutions. The flexibility of the software framework has allowed the information system to evolve with advances in technology and representation methods. Possible new features include knowledge-based image retrieval and tutoring, dynamic generation of 3-D scenes, and eventually, real-time virtual reality navigation through the body. Such features, when coupled with other on-line biomedical information resources, should lead to interesting new ways for managing and accessing structural information in medicine.",

    "title": "[The development of the medical information system for the improvement of the quality of work of the Crimean spa and health resorts].",
    "abstract": "The Crimea has the enormous potential for the health promotion activities. However, neither the profile of these activities nor the demand for the socio-medical services is clearly defined for the majority of the local spa and health resort facilities. The possibilities of modern information technology are not used in the full measure either. The objective of the present work was to elaborate the new medical information system and demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, the article describes the main advantages of the system for the optimization of healthcare in the Crimean spa and health resort facilities. We reviewed and analyzed various literature publications, legal framework, standards, regulations, guidelines, and questionnaire survey data obtain at 50 spa and health resort facilities of the Crimea. The results of the assessment indicate the necessity of the systematic approach to the analysis of the quality of medical care and the process of its further development. Statistical and mathematical methods were used to elaborate the medical information system for the optimization of the activities of the Crimean spa and health resorts. The distinctive features of the proposed information system are modularity and the possibility of flexible adjustment to the conditions of individual settings, one-step data loading with the subsequent multiple application for the formulation of documents, automated filling of records in compliance with the medical standards, and taking into consideration the possible changes in or amendments to the form of the documents. The data obtained in the course of project implementation were used for the first time in the Republic of Crimea to design, substantiate, and recommend for the practical application the algorithm for the comprehensive estimation of the results of treatment of the patients based at the spa and health resort facilities with due regard for the specific regional conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Chemical Accidents Response Information System (CARIS) was developed at the Center for Chemical Safety Management in South Korea in order to track and predict the dispersion of hazardous chemicals in the case of an accident or terrorist attack involving chemical companies. The main objective of CARIS is to facilitate an efficient emergency response to hazardous chemical accidents by rapidly providing key information in the decision-making process. In particular, the atmospheric modeling system implemented in CARIS, which is composed of a real-time numerical weather forecasting model and an air pollution dispersion model, can be used as a tool to forecast concentrations and to provide a wide range of assessments associated with various hazardous chemicals in real time. This article introduces the components of CARIS and describes its operational modeling system. Some examples of the operational modeling system and its use for emergency preparedness are presented and discussed. Finally, this article evaluates the current numerical weather prediction model for Korea.",

Today, the needs of physicians in medical information, including therapeutic information, are not met. Further, the information reaching the doctors is rarely consistent with the available evidence. The growth rate of emerging evidence and its increasing complexity make the doctors unable to cope with it within the current medical information system. So, there is a real need to sort out a new way for transferring therapeutic information to doctors and patients. We conceived a new paradigm and designed an Internet process based on it by which unbiased evidence is brought to doctors in such a format that it can be accessed and used during the visit.",

    "abstract": "South Africa initiated a national District Health Information System rollout strategy in the latter half of 1999. Experience has demonstrated that the implementation of an information system as a vehicle for the delivery of accountability in the management of health services, demands organisational change within a framework of human resource development and technical support. The aim of training, to empower facility and district staff to use locally generated information to improve coverage and quality of primary health care services, can only be realized if training and innovation for change are appropriately marketed and supported. The appeal of HISP software, a locally developed application system lies in its user acceptance. While computers form a vital tool in providing easily accessible information for decision-making, their use must not be seen as a panacea for all information problems in primary health care services. Strategies for promoting sustainability of DHIS implementation lie in the social processes of human resource development, changing organisational infrastructure and the use of ongoing evaluation rather than those of technical infrastructure. South Africa has developed a variety of mechanisms to facilitate this process.",

In response to this demand, health care facilities have sought to upgrade or replace their computer systems with ones that have greater ability to enhance decision making in real time. The standard development process dictates a requirements analysis, with a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a likely product. This document, which delineates the institution's needs and provides a guide for appropriate vendor responses, has been given scant attention in the literature, particularly in the health care environment. This paper attempts to provide insight into what the goals and objectives of the RFP should be and explicates those elements that are necessary to produce an effective instrument. It details what information should be included about the institution, basic hardware and software issues that should be addressed, and proposes guidelines for response and evaluation. It is suggested that the proper development of an RFP will be a key factor in the successful acquisition of an appropriate health care information system.",

In this paper, we show that though their scheme is efficient, their scheme still has two security weaknesses such as (1) it has design flaws in authentication phase and (2) it has design flaws in password change phase. In order to withstand these flaws found in Lee-Liu's scheme, we propose an improvement of their scheme. Our improved scheme keeps also the original merits of Lee-Liu's scheme. We show that our scheme is efficient as compared to Lee-Liu's scheme. Further, through the security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition, we simulate our scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks.",

We also need comprehensive Clinical Information System with computer database to manage such system. In our research we were using HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) and AN-DRG (Australian National-DRG) methodology for DRG classification. We also used ICD 10-Revision for diagnosis coding. We have chosen ORL Clinic for DRG classification because of two reasons: 1) They treat two basic types of patients medical and surgical and 2) They had pretty good sorted patients' records. Our base for DRG classification was 1997 year. During our research we found many deficiencies in patient records in both its parts: medical and financial. Since all records were processed and stored manually, financial data didn't exist. So we had to use other ways for direct and indirect costs allocation (for Prospective Payment System purpose). In 1998 we processed 680 patient records (treated in 1997), and made DRG classification putting all 680 patients' records into 183 DRG: 47 medical and 136 surgical. This is so called CASE-MIX of the ORL Clinic for year 1997. DRG classification we made at Tuzla ORL Clinic was identical with HCFA DRG classification system in 92%.",

A secure and efficient authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system provides safeguarding patients' electronic patient records (EPRs) and helps health care workers and medical personnel to rapidly making correct clinical decisions.

However, their scheme is still vulnerable to lost smart card and stolen verifier attacks. This investigation discusses these weaknesses and proposes a secure and efficient authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system as alternative. Compared with related approaches, the proposed scheme not only retains a lower computational cost and does not require verifier tables for storing users' secrets, but also solves the security problems in previous schemes and withstands possible attacks.",

For trust calculation a novel set of measurable context-aware and health information-sensitive attributes is developed. The architecture enables a person to manage his or her privacy in ubiquitous environment by formulating context-aware and service provider specific policies. Focus groups and information modelling was used for developing a wellness information model. System analysis method based on sequential steps that enable to combine results of analysis of privacy and trust concerns and the selection of trust and privacy services was used for development of the information system architecture.

The current study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Mortality Information System (MIS) for discriminating between basic causes of neonatal deaths and defining percentages of reducible causes. The basic causes of early neonatal deaths in hospitals in Maceió, Alagoas State, were analyzed, and the causes recorded in medical records were compared to the MIS data in order to measure reliability and validity. The modified SEADE Foundation and Wigglesworth classifications were compared to analyze the capacity for reduction of neonatal mortality. Maternal causes predominated in the medical records, as compared to respiratory disorders on the death certificates and in the MIS. The percentage of avoidable deaths may be much higher than observed from the MIS, due to imprecision in completing death certificates. Based on the MIS, the greatest problems are in early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal causes. However, the results show that the most pressing problems relate to failures in prenatal care and lack of control of diseases.",

This study attempts to develop a new logic separation inference method applied to a database with a format like most real-world medical records containing many missing data and miscellaneous variables. It is expected that this method should have better performance than currently accessible methods. The newly developed logic separation inference method shows a classification power of 0.997 (elimination method is 1), which is better than the simple replacing method (replaced by mode shows 0.974). Both inference methods (mode and mean) have superior classification power to the simple replacing method. The missing data treatment processes introduced in this study can be completed on a MS Excel spreadsheet without any complicated calculation; therefore, they can satisfy general users. This new missing data treatment method is only applied up to 60% of the missing data (missing at random). However, when there is large amount of data, it is expected that this method also can be applied to a database missing more than 60%.",

    "abstract": "The clinical laboratory's use of computers has evolved beyond the single minicomputer stand-alone system. Our laboratory information system is now part of an institutional network. The laboratory also uses smaller systems and workstations for a wide variety of functions, often with much data duplication among systems. We have been developing a network-based virtual database for laboratory test information. This system uses World Wide Web standards for hypertext and multimedia displays, which allows for the display of information retrieved from various department computer sources without the necessity of data duplication, modification of existing systems, or centralization of data. The medical technologists can continue to write testing procedures on their word processors. Maintenance of reference values, specimen requirements, etc., can continue as a laboratory information system function. Yet information from all of these disparate sources can be viewed in a consolidated format that has platform independence.",

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based solutions are widely used for providing many healthcare applications include patient monitoring, object traceability, drug administration system and telecare medicine information system (TMIS) etc. In order to reduce malpractices and ensure patient privacy, in 2015, Srivastava et al. proposed a hash based RFID tag authentication protocol in TMIS. Their protocol uses lightweight hash operation and synchronized secret value shared between back-end server and tag, which is more secure and efficient than other related RFID authentication protocols. Unfortunately, in this paper, we demonstrate that Srivastava et al.'s tag authentication protocol has a serious security problem in that an adversary may use the stolen/lost reader to connect to the medical back-end server that store information associated with tagged objects and this privacy damage causing the adversary could reveal medical data obtained from stolen/lost readers in a malicious way. Therefore, we propose a secure and efficient RFID tag authentication protocol to overcome security flaws and improve the system efficiency. Compared with Srivastava et al.'s protocol, the proposed protocol not only inherits the advantages of Srivastava et al.'s authentication protocol for TMIS but also provides better security with high system efficiency.",

    "title": "How best to geo-reference farms? A case study from Cornwall, England.",
    "abstract": "The commonest way of geo-referencing farms as single points is using the location of the farmhouse as either read off a map or approximated by its postcode. While these two methods may be adequate for small farms, they are unlikely to be satisfactory for large ones, or alternatively when they are comprised of several discrete units or holdings. In order to investigate the best representation of the total farm polygon(s) by a single point, we undertook a study using nearly 500 actual farm boundaries in the county of Cornwall, England. For each farm, the farm boundaries were digitised, and its area and centroid determined using ArcView 3.2. A variety of point geo-referencing systems were tested to find the best single point location for a farm, as judged by the proportion of farm area captured. Whilst the centroid was found to capture the largest area, the main farm building was judged to be the best geo-referencing method for practical purposes. In contrast, the various systems of geo-coding using the farm postal address performed relatively poorly. Where there are separate parcels of land managed together in a single parish, they may be identified as a single unit, but if there are separate parcels in different parishes they should be identified as separate units.The implications of these results for Great Britain's national animal health information system (VETNET) are discussed.",

Distributed cognition provides researchers a richer theoretical understanding of human-computer interactions and enables re-searchers to capture the phenomenon that emerges in social interactions as well as the interactions between people and structures in their environment.",

    "title": "Exploring the Integration Model of Industry Chain Information System Based on Energy Internet and Its Key Technologies.",
    "abstract": "Many enterprises have elevated industrial chain management to an important strategic factor for successful operation in a competitive market environment. There are many reasons for the low success rate of enterprise information construction, one of which is that in the process of information construction, only the research of information technology and the construction of information systems are emphasized, but not the integrated management of information resources, and the strategy, mode and method of information resource management are not studied. As a solution for sustainable energy development in the future, the energy Internet has become a hot topic of research in academia and industry today. Integrated innovation, at the enterprise level, is the key to improving core competitiveness and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. In order to achieve a deep integration of information technology and energy technology, the energy Internet must be supported by a corresponding system, i.e., an energy information system. In this paper, we propose an information system integration model based on the nature of the industry chain, describe its functional components, and analyze the key technologies of integration. The results show that the integrated model achieves the highest value of each output solution in the time period of 4h, and the calculated transmission capacity of the line is 0.7pu The integrated model of the information system is optimal for the adaptation of the energy environment of each distributed power source in the energy Internet. Therefore, this study provides theoretical support and practical reference for further research on the construction and mechanism of the integrated energy Internet in China's theoretical and business communities, and provides important insights into the construction of the mechanism and countermeasures for the integration of the industrial chain in energy Internet enterprises.",

The data were obtained from the SIM of the Municipal Health Department, municipal police enquiries, and local newspaper articles, resulting in a databank with 495 deaths from external causes. The results showed a high proportion of deaths with indeterminate intent (21%) in the SIM, suggesting problems with quality of information. Comparison of data from the SIM and police department detected problems with coverage in the SIM (21%) and thus in the official statistics on mortality from accidents and violence. The results emphasize the importance of searches in other data sources to upgrade the SIM and expand its coverage, and especially the need for studies to identify and analyze problems faced by small and medium-sized cities in the production of mortality data.",

Nursing practice is under pressure of the changes, which often lead to dysfunctional workflow. The purposes for this literature review were (1) to identify what has been examined about disruptions of nursing care workflow in using Clinical information systems and (2) to obtain a lesson for future research to investigate disruptions of nursing care workflow in using Clinical information systems. In reviewed studies, nursing workflow disruptions have limitedly been reported. Nursing care workflow has not been investigated sufficiently; thus, what happened to nursing care workflow by using a Clinical information system has not been fully known. Nurses have a need for the use of a Clinical information system in aspects of nursing perspective in patient care. Unless the use of Clinical information systems provides effective workflow of nursing care, it will result in confusion in nursing practice as well as poor quality of patient care. It is essential to capture disruptions and/or effectiveness in nursing care workflow from the perspectives of nurses. The required research approach to clinical settings is to identify all facets of adverse consequences triggered from the use of a Clinical information system by following the context of nursing care workflow.",

    "title": "Integrating pharmacokinetics into point-of-care information systems.",
    "abstract": "Computer-based patient care information systems (PCIS) have emerged as an integral component of healthcare organisations. Currently, 4 models of PCIS exist: the centralised model, the hub-and-spoke model, the network model, and the distributed model. The centralised model has the advantage of a central patient database; however, a major disadvantage of this model is the inability to easily interface with other software packages. The hub-and-spoke model links satellite or feeder systems into a mainframe computer; thus, each satellite has the ability to work independently. This system is limited by the ability to interface satellite systems with the mainframe computer. The network model works via a local area network (LAN) using client server technology which allows for high speed data access and transfer. The network model does not provide an integrated view of patient information and can access only 1 host system at a time. The distributed model is similar to the network model in design but provides for data and system integration via relational databases. This allows for the creation of a central data repository and support for decision-support tools. Computer-assisted decision support has the potential to significantly improve clinical decision-making. Six types of computer-assisted decision-support have been defined: alerting, interpreting, assisting, critiquing, diagnosing and managing. Software representing each type of decision-support software has been incorporated into clinical practice; however, with the exception of drug interaction programs, widespread incorporation of decision-support software into PCIS is uncommon. Clinical pharmacokinetic programs are a category of pharmacy-related decision-support software, and current clinical pharmacokinetic software systems can be categorised as interpreting, assisting or critiquing decision-support. Despite the potential for significant clinical contributions, the integration of clinical pharmacokinetic software into PCIS is uncommon. Most packages are available only as stand alone programs or as a module of a pharmacy information system. These packages usually maintain their own centralised database and require special file transfer protocols for integration. Although PCIS are becoming more commonplace, the integration of commercial clinical pharmacokinetic packages into PCIS is limited. New technology using standardised and relational databases should allow for easier integration in the future.",

The methodology was based on the theory of the technology acceptance model. This study adopted a cross-sectional study method to survey and collect data. In total, 167 questionnaires were distributed to subjects. Approximately 94.6%, or 158 valid questionnaires, were collected. The data were analyzed using SPSS and PLS software.The data analysis indicated that the factors that most significantly influenced the willingness of nurses to use the nursing information system were their degrees of satisfaction with the system and their perceptions of its usefulness. A nursing information system that can provide functions that are useful and convenient and that facilitate the avoidance of tedious repetitive writing and improve the quality of provided care can encourage nurse satisfaction with the system and thus stimulate their interest in using it for their work. The ease of use of the system can also affect the willingness of nurses to use it.",

    "abstract": "While studies have shown that usability evaluation could uncover many design problems of health information systems, the usability of health information systems in developing countries using their native language is poorly studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of a nationwide inpatient information system used in many academic hospitals in Iran. Three trained usability evaluators independently evaluated the system using Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. The evaluators combined identified problems in a single list and independently rated the severity of the problems. We statistically compared the number and severity of problems identified by HIS experienced and non-experienced evaluators. A total of 158 usability problems were identified. After removing duplications 99 unique problems were left. The highest mismatch with usability principles was related to \"Consistency and standards\" heuristic (25%) and the lowest related to \"Flexibility and efficiency of use\" (4%). The average severity of problems ranged from 2.4 (Major problem) to 3.3 (Catastrophe problem). The experienced evaluator with HIS identified significantly more problems and gave higher severities to problems (p<0.02). Heuristic Evaluation identified a high number of usability problems in a widely used inpatient information system in many academic hospitals. These problems, if remain unsolved, may waste users' and patients' time, increase errors and finally threaten patient's safety. Many of them can be fixed with simple redesign solutions such as using clear labels and better layouts. This study suggests conducting further studies to confirm the findings concerning effect of evaluator experience on the results of Heuristic Evaluation.",

While hospital librarians have increased their computer literacy, IS staff have begun to recognize the value of knowledge-based information as an IS resource. Parallel growth and mutual interest have resulted in increased opportunities for information professionals to share skills and network for mutual advantage. Creating positive relationships between the hospital librarian and IS staff can be critical to the success of the hospital library. This paper provides a framework in which to explore the levels of relationship that exist within institutions between hospital librarians and IS staff. The \"knowing/caring ladder\" is presented as a model to illustrate levels of relationship and their consequences. The authors contend that recognition of the levels of professional relationship determines the success or failure of team building.",

As researchers conducting separate studies in the United States, The Netherlands, and Australia, using similar qualitative methods to investigate implementing PCISs, the authors have encountered many instances in which PCIS applications seem to foster errors rather than reduce their likelihood. The authors describe the kinds of silent errors they have witnessed and, from their different social science perspectives (information science, sociology, and cognitive science), they interpret the nature of these errors. The errors fall into two main categories: those in the process of entering and retrieving information, and those in the communication and coordination process that the PCIS is supposed to support. The authors believe that with a heightened awareness of these issues, informaticians can educate, design systems, implement, and conduct research in such a way that they might be able to avoid the unintended consequences of these subtle silent errors.",

    "title": "Reflections on the role of open source in health information system interoperability.",
    "abstract": "This paper reflects on the role of open source in health information system interoperability. Open source is a driving force in computer science research and the development of information systems. It facilitates the sharing of information and ideas, enables evolutionary development and open collaborative testing of code, and broadens the adoption of interoperability standards. In health care, information systems have been developed largely ad hoc following proprietary specifications and customized design. However, the wide deployment of integrated services such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) over regional health information networks (RHINs) relies on interoperability of the underlying information systems and medical devices. This reflection is built on the experiences of the PICNIC project that developed shared software infrastructure components in open source for RHINs and the OpenECG network that offers open source components to lower the implementation cost of interoperability standards such as SCP-ECG, in electrocardiography. Open source components implementing standards and a community providing feedback from real-world use are key enablers of health care information system interoperability. Investing in open source is investing in interoperability and a vital aspect of a long term strategy towards comprehensive health services and clinical research.",

The 14 Safe Communities active in Sweden during 2002 were invited to participate and 13 accepted. A questionnaire on computer usage and a critical incident technique instrument were distributed. Sharing of management information, creating social capital for safety promotion, and injury data recording were found to be key areas that need to be further supported by computer-based information systems. Most respondents reported having access to a personal computer workstation with standard office software. Interest in using more advanced computer applications was low, and there was considerable need for technical user support. Areas where information systems can be used to make health promotion practice more efficient were identified, and patterns of computers usage were described.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory information systems are widely used health information systems that have the potential to improve health care quality. Despite their benefits, many studies have indicated problems with user interaction with these systems due to poor interface design. To evaluate the usability of a laboratory information system. In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we used heuristic evaluation to examine the user interface design of a laboratory information system in an academic hospital affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences in 2017. This system is also used in 59 other Iranian hospitals .We investigated the usability of different parts of the usability of a laboratory information system (outpatient admission, inpatient admission, sample collection, and test result reporting). Data were collected using a standard form based on the heuristic evaluation method, and categorized based on their severity and violated heuristics. The content validity was confirmed by 3 medical informatics specialists. We identified 162 usability problems. In terms of the heuristics, the highest number of problems concerned flexibility and efficiency of use (n = 32, 19.75%) and the lowest concerned help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (n = 2, 1.23%). In terms of different modules of the system, the highest number of problems (n = 51, 31.48%) concerned outpatient admission and the lowest (n = 29, 17.9%) concerned sample collection. In terms of severity, 45.06% of the problems were rated as major. Despite widespread use of laboratory information systems, their user interface design has usability problems that diminish the quality of user interaction with these systems and may affect the quality of health care. Consideration of standards and principles for user interface design, such as the heuristics used in this study, could improve system usability.",

Employees and all cleaning and disinfected instruments and equipment from 56 inpatient departments in our hospital were selected as the subjects of observation. The period before the intervention (January 2023) was designated as the control group, while the period after the intervention (July 2023) was designated as the study group. In the control group, the instruments and equipment under routine management were disinfected. The research team applied the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method to clean and disinfect the surfaces of instruments and equipment on the basis of standardization and cleaning and disinfection information system management. Employees' theoretical knowledge points and operational skill scores before and after the intervention were compared and evaluated. The changes in the risk priority coefficient (RPN) values of high-risk factors were analyzed. Fifty-six clinical medical staff from 56 inpatient departments in the hospital were selected to evaluate the clinical satisfaction of the cleaning and disinfection management of instruments and equipment before and after the intervention, and the clinical satisfaction of the two groups was compared. The scores of theoretical knowledge and operational skills of the staff in the research group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The passing rates of theoretical knowledge and operational skills in the control group and the research group were 44.64 and 94.64% respectively, and 55.36 and 96.43%, respectively. The qualified rate of theoretical knowledge and operational skills of staff in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group ( < 0.05). The RPN scores of medical personnel, environment, system and system guarantee factors in the control group were 80, 80, 80, and 100, respectively. The RPN scores of medical personnel factors, environmental factors, system factors and system guarantee factors in the research group were 6, 24, 24, and 36, respectively.

    "abstract": "Over the last six years since University Hospital opened, the University Hospital Information System (UHIS) has continued to evolve to what is today an advanced administrative and clinical information system. At University Hospital UHIS is the way of conducting business. A wide range of patient care applications are operational including Patient Registration, ADT for Inpatient/Outpatient/Emergency Room visits, Advanced Order Entry/Result Reporting, Medical Records, Lab Automated Data Acquisition/Quality Control, Pharmacy, Radiology, Dietary, Respiratory Therapy, ECG, EEG, Cardiology, Physical/Occupational Therapy and Nursing. These systems and numerous financial systems have been installed in a highly tuned, efficient computer system. All applications are real-time, on-line, and data base oriented. Each system is provided with multiple data security levels, forward file recovery, and dynamic transaction backout of in-flight tasks. Sensitive medical information is safeguarded by job function passwords, identification codes, need-to-know master screens and terminal keylocks. University Hospital has an IBM 3083 CPU with five 3380 disk drives, four dual density tape drives, and a 3705 network controller. The network of 300 terminals and 100 printers is connected to the computer center by an RF broadband cable. The software is configured around the IBM/MVS operating system using CICS as the telecommunication monitor, IMS as the data base management system and PCS/ADS as the application enabling tool. The most extensive clinical system added to UHIS is the Physiological Monitoring/Patient Data Management System with serves 92 critical care beds. In keeping with the Hospital's philosophy of integrated computing, the PMS/PDMS with its network of minicomputers was linked to the UHIS system. In a pilot program, remote access to UHIS through the IBM personal computer has been implemented in several physician offices in the local community, further extending the communications horizons of University Hospital's Information System. The implications of remote access to PDMS through the IBM PC emulating a Siemens Model 420 Patient Data Management Terminal are being examined.",

    "abstract": "Big data has revolutionized the world by providing tremendous opportunities for a variety of applications. It contains a gigantic amount of data, especially a plethora of data types that has been significantly useful in diverse research domains. In healthcare domain, the researchers use computational devices to extract enriched relevant information from this data and develop smart applications to solve real-life problems in a timely fashion. Electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) facilities alongwith the availability of new computational models have enabled the doctors and researchers to extract relevant information and visualize the healthcare big data in a new spectrum. Digital transformation of healthcare systems by using of information system, medical technology, handheld and smart wearable devices has posed many challenges to researchers and caretakers in the form of storage, minimizing treatment cost, and processing time (to extract enriched information, and minimize error rates to make optimum decisions). In this research work, the existing literature is analysed and assessed, to identify gaps that result in affecting the overall performance of the available healthcare applications. Also, it aims to suggest enhanced solutions to address these gaps. In this comprehensive systematic research work, the existing literature reported during 2011 to 2021, is thoroughly analysed for identifying the efforts made to facilitate the doctors and practitioners for diagnosing diseases using healthcare big data analytics. A set of rresearch questions are formulated to analyse the relevant articles for identifying the key features and optimum management solutions, and laterally use these analyses to achieve effective outcomes. The results of this systematic mapping conclude that despite of hard efforts made in the domains of healthcare big data analytics, the newer hybrid machine learning based systems and cloud computing-based models should be adapted to reduce treatment cost, simulation time and achieve improved quality of care. This systematic mapping will also result in enhancing the capabilities of doctors, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to use this study as evidence for future research.",

    "title": "Performance and cost evaluation of health information systems using micro-costing and discrete-event simulation.",
    "abstract": "Innovation and health-care funding reforms have contributed to the deployment of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve patient care. Many health-care organizations considered the application of ICT as a crucial key to enhance health-care management. The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology to assess the organizational impact of high-level Health Information System (HIS) on patient pathway. We propose an integrated performance evaluation of HIS approach through the combination of formal modeling using the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) models, a micro-costing approach for cost evaluation, and a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) approach. The methodology is applied to the consultation for cancer treatment process. Simulation scenarios are established to conclude about the impact of HIS on patient pathway. We demonstrated that although high level HIS lengthen the consultation, occupation rate of oncologists are lower and quality of service is higher (through the number of available information accessed during the consultation to formulate the diagnostic). The provided method allows also to determine the most cost-effective ICT elements to improve the care process quality while minimizing costs. The methodology is flexible enough to be applied to other health-care systems.",

    "abstract": "GNU Health, an open-source clinical information system, offers a comprehensive solution for managing health records, hospital information, and laboratory data. Despite its robust functionality and cost-effective nature, GNU Health remains underutilized in the European healthcare context. This paper explores the potential benefits of implementing GNU Health in European healthcare systems, emphasizing its capacity for customization, integration, and scalability. We also examine the barriers to its widespread adoption, including regulatory challenges, interoperability issues, and resistance to change from established proprietary systems. Through one case study and expert interviews, we provide insights into why these obstacles can hardly be overcome.",

    "abstract": "Nurse information needs at the point of care exist; however, once provided with access to resources, nurses seek evidence-based answers. The success of answering an information need through an automated Infobutton relies on the program's ability to anticipate a clinician's question. This study's six process methodology aims to meet context-specific information needs related to clinical information system (CIS) nursing orders. Context-specific questions were derived from nurse generic questions generated from nurse focus group data, observational data, and an established taxonomy. The context-specific questions, were filtered by nursing order semantic type within a logical clinical context cluster (LCCC), which is a clinical association identified from the nurse perspective. Nursing orders of the same semantic type are associated with similar types of nurse information needs and are used to assess Internet-based resources for the capability to answer those information needs. LCCCs help identify resources and CIS areas ripe for an Infobutton.",

    "abstract": "To develop information systems (IS) in the changing environment of the health sector, a simple but throughout model, avoiding the techno-jargon of informatics, might be useful for the top management. A platform neutral, extensible, transparent conceptual model should be established. Limitations of current methods lead to a simple, but comprehensive mapping, in the form of a three-dimensional cube. The three 'orthogonal' views are (a) organization functionality, (b) organizational structures and (c) information technology. Each of the cube-sides is described according to its nature. This approach enables to define any kind of an IS component as a certain point/layer/domain of the cube and enables also the management to label all IS components independently form any supplier(s) and/or any specific platform. The model handles changes in organization structure, business functionality and the serving info-system independently form each other. Practical application extends to (a) planning complex, new ISs, (b) guiding development of multi-vendor, multi-site ISs, (c) supporting large-scale public procurement procedures and the contracting, implementation phase by establishing a platform neutral reference, (d) keeping an exhaustive inventory of an existing large-scale system, that handles non-tangible aspects of the IS.",

    "abstract": "Information systems, either computer or paper based, are the key to business effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare organizations. The rationale of starting a large healthcare informatics project by the Ministry of Health and Welfare may be argued by two needs: (1) the need of medical data transformation into the information required for public health policy decision-making; and (2) measures in the field of health and pharmacoeconomics, i.e. systematic surveillance of healthcare costs that define the prospects for savings without lowering the level of service (estimated at 20%-30% of potential savings), along with the need of transparency and adoption of European Union directives and standards. Implementation of the proposed system results in two groups of fundamental functions: (1) the creation of a central public health information system which facilitates real-time tracking of primary healthcare cost generators, which in turn are used for creating health economics policy, and (2) to automatize the process of generating a consolidated national health budget including the Croatian Institute of Health Insurance and hospitals as well as consolidated financial reports for all those involved in the healthcare system. The model of the National Health Information System of the Republic of Croatia is described.",

    "abstract": "The customary medicinal plant knowledge possessed by the Australian Aboriginal people is a significant resource. Published information on it is scattered throughout the literature, in heterogeneous data formats, and is scattered among various Aboriginal communities across Australia, due to a multiplicity of languages. This ancient knowledge is at risk due to loss of biodiversity, cultural impact and the demise of many of its custodians. We have developed the Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb), an integrated multidisciplinary resource, to document, conserve and disseminate this knowledge. CMKb is an online relational database for collating, disseminating, visualising and analysing initially public domain data on customary medicinal plants. The database stores information related to taxonomy, phytochemistry, biogeography, biological activities of customary medicinal plant species as well as images of individual species. The database can be accessed at http://biolinfo.org/cmkb. Known bioactive molecules are characterized within the chemoinformatics module of CMKb, with functions available for molecular editing and visualization. CMKb has been developed as a prototype data resource for documenting, integrating, disseminating, analysing multidisciplinary customary medicinal plant data from Australia and to facilitate user-defined complex querying. Each species in CMKb is linked to online resources such as the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), NCBI Taxonomy, Australia's SpeciesLinks-Integrated Botanical Information System (IBIS) and Google images. The bioactive compounds are linked to the PubChem database. Overall, CMKb serves as a single knowledgebase for holistic plant-derived therapeutics and can be used as an information resource for biodiversity conservation, to lead discovery and conservation of customary medicinal knowledge.",

To achieve this, active participation from the medical-dental staff via an advisory committee, system education and emphasis on physician benefits was sought. Advance preparation included selection of light pen technology, field trips by selected physicians to other hospitals with the same system, and strategic placement and availability of terminals. During implementation, training was scheduled at the convenience of the physician. This training continues to be offered immediately to new physicians as they join the staff. System upgrades and added functions prompt scheduling of demonstrations for interested physicians. Many developmental ideas come from physicians using MIS indicating their interest in maintaining the system. New approaches that will make order entry easier for physicians so that everyone can benefit from their cooperation and participation are continually being looked for.",

Accordingly, nurse case managers must take an active role in defining and communicating their needs. The purpose of this article (the first of two) is to present a general overview of the information needs of the nurse case manager and the computerized information system tools available (and emerging) to meet these needs. A follow-up article in the next issue of Nursing Case Management will focus on a typical clinical information system selection process; outline specific ways the nurse case manager can effectively influence that process; and provide a checklist that will enable the nurse case manager to assist the institution in selecting and implementing the most appropriate system.",

This study is the first to introduce a patient safety-based acupuncture treatment information system that integrates advanced healthcare devices to reduce the risks associated with acupuncture treatment using a computerized physician order entry system for traditional Chinese medicine. The acupuncture treatment information system considerably improved patient safety and increased clinicians' workflow efficiency. The importance-performance analysis indicated that improvement in the vital sign measurement function was of the highest priority. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment--the demand for which is increasing--can be performed more safely using an acupuncture treatment information system.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare as a worldwide industry is experiencing a period of growth based on health information technology. The capabilities of cloud systems make it as an option to develop eHealth goals. The main objectives of the present study was to evaluate the advantages and limitations of health information systems implementation in a cloud-computing context that was conducted as a systematic review in 2016. Science direct, Scopus, Web of science, IEEE, PubMed and Google scholar were searched according study criteria. Among 308 articles initially found, 21 articles were entered in the final analysis. All the studies had considered cloud computing as a positive tool to help advance health technology, but none had insisted too much on its limitations and threats. Electronic health record systems have been mostly studied in the fields of implementation, designing, and presentation of models and prototypes. According to this research, the main advantages of cloud-based health information systems could be categorized into the following groups: economic benefits and advantages of information management. The main limitations of the implementation of cloud-based health information systems could be categorized into the 4 groups of security, legal, technical, and human restrictions. Compared to earlier studies, the present research had the advantage of dealing with the issue of health information systems in a cloud platform. The high frequency of studies conducted on the implementation of cloud-based health information systems revealed health industry interest in the application of this technology. Security was a subject discussed in most studies due to health information sensitivity. In this investigation, some mechanisms and solutions were discussed concerning the mentioned systems, which would provide a suitable area for future scientific research on this issue. The limitations and solutions discussed in this systematic study would help healthcare managers and decision-makers take better and more efficient advantages of this technology and make better planning to adopt cloud-based health information systems.",

    "abstract": "The selection of a new healthcare information system (HIS) has always been a daunting process for clinicians, health care providers and policy makers. The objective of this study is to present the lessons learned and the main findings from several relevant case studies to support this process. Data were collected by retrospectively reviewing the summative results of three well-established systems, acquiring feedback from two E.U. projects, and conducting semi-structured interviews with a number of collaborators involved in electronic healthcare interventions. Selection issues were identified and classified into the following five categories: (i) data creation, (ii) data management, (iii) data sharing, (iv) data presentation and (v) modules management. A mind map was also structured to provide a more manageable list of issues concerning the most common electronic clinical technologies (e-CT). The vendor manual is intended as an overview of the merchandise e-CT and therefore has limited potential in supporting effectively the selection process of a new HIS. The present classification and the mind map - based on lessons learned - provide a ready-to-use toolkit for supporting the HIS selection process when healthcare organisations are unable to employ research development groups to lay the groundwork for building a new HIS from scratch.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the legal and strategic issues raised by the use of information systems in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care organizations. Given the critical nature of information systems to an HMO's business success and regulatory compliance, the large financial investment HMOs make in their systems, and the widely publicized concerns over the year 2000 \"millennium bug\" problem, information systems are appropriately a matter of concern to an HMO's board of directors. The recent experience of Oxford Health Plans, Inc. offers a case study in the apparent failure of the directors to monitor adequately the in-house development of an information system. The systems disaster which this corporation suffered in 1997 led to a dramatic drop in stock price, from which the company has yet to recover, as well as intense scrutiny by state and federal regulators and countless shareholder derivative actions against the directors. Corporate directors are subject to the fiduciary duty of care. Despite statutes in some states requiring directors to act prudently, state courts almost always apply the standard of gross negligence. As a result, even when directors act without due deliberation in their decision, it is rare that a court will find them to have failed in their duty of care. The business and regulatory community may find otherwise, however, when directors fail to evaluate information systems options carefully and the business suffers as a result.",

    "abstract": "The integration of health care and social welfare services together with the consolidation of health care information systems (HISs) and client information systems (CISs) has become a timely topic. Despite this development, there is a scarcity of systematic research on physicians', registered nurses' (RNs) and social welfare professionals' (SWPs) experiences of participating in the development of HISs and CISs. This study aimed to examine how physicians, RNs and SWPs experience collaboration with HIS or CIS vendors, and what kinds of end users have participated in HIS or CIS development. National cross-sectional usability surveys were conducted in Finland among RNs and SWPs in 2020 and physicians in 2021. Questions concerning participation experiences were analyzed by professional group, working sector, managerial position, and age. In total, 4683 physicians, 3610 RNs, and 990 SWPs responded to the surveys. In all 3 professional groups, those working in nonmanagerial positions and the youngest respondents participated least in HIS or CIS development, and 76% (n=3528) of physicians, 78% (n=2814) of RNs and 67% (n=664) of SWPs had not participated at all. When comparing the groups, physicians were least aware of feedback processes and least satisfied with vendors' interest in end-user feedback and the manner and speed of HIS development. Those who had dedicated working time for HIS or CIS development were less critical of vendors' interest and responsiveness to development ideas than those who had not participated at all. In all 3 professional groups, the youngest were most dissatisfied with HIS and CIS vendor collaboration. Experiences of participation in HIS and CIS development were relatively negative across all 3 professional groups, with physicians being the most critical. Dialogue and collaboration between developers and end users-also the youngest ones and frontline workers-need improvement; simply increasing allotted working time is unlikely to produce more positive participation experiences.",

    "title": "Improving blood transfusion practice: role of a computerized hospital information system.",
    "abstract": "The recent focus on medical risk and financial cost has prompted a need for better guidelines for prescribing the transfusion of blood components. In 1987, to respond to the issues of quality transfusion practice and accurate evaluation, LDS Hospital (Salt Lake City, UT) began using a computerized, knowledge-based blood-ordering system. Each transfusion request was reviewed and flagged by the computer when it did not meet the criteria established by the medical staff. The study reviewed the use of red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma in 13,082 transfusion orders for 5847 consecutive patients from July 1, 1988, through June 30, 1989. The evaluation assessed, first, the adherence of physicians to computerized criteria and, second, their adherence to the quality of transfusion practice. A high percentage of the blood units ordered met the established criteria: 91.2 percent for the red cell transfusions, 72.9 percent for platelets, and 81.7 percent for fresh-frozen plasma. From the July 1, 1987, implementation date through June 1989, the mean hematocrit of persons being transfused dropped from 28.6 to 27.7 percent (0.29 = 0.28) (p less than 0.005) and the number of orders requiring review by the quality assurance department dropped from 100 to 14 percent; moreover, there was a true-exception rate of only 0.37 percent. The use of the computer system effected the implementation of the following measures: 1) identification of the indications and establishment of clear clinical and biologic parameters for every transfusion, and 2) measurement and improvement of institutional transfusion practice. These results demonstrated the efficacy of a computerized hospital information system in implementing continuous quality improvement for transfusion practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Sites lacking clinician attention varied from poor (eg, LUNG - 23.23% [13.24%]) to largely incomplete (eg, BRAIN - 2.01% [0.38%]).This disappointing medical data completion rate makes its use in a 'Big Data' effort suspect.

It was first vetted at an informatics retreat held in 1989 at Columbia University's Arden Homestead. The syntax was intended to be readable by clinician experts but to provide powerful array processing, which was derived largely a programming language called APL. The syntax was improved and implemented by a number of researchers and vendors in the early 1990's and was initially adopted by the consensus standards organization, the American Society for Testing and Materials.",

In this article, prevention is used as an example of the implementation of protocols. After a short definition of prevention, the implementation of preventative modules (or protocols) in the ISAAC GP information system is discussed. There are several conditions or critical factors if the implementation of prevention (and protocols) in a GP information system and in a GP practice is to be successful.

Second, we claim that, though Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are often still seen as the standard approach, this type of design hardly generates relevant information for the organizational decision maker. Interpretive study of evaluation literature. The field of evaluation is scattered and the types of questions that can be asked and methods that can be used seem infinite and badly demarcated. Different stakeholders, moreover, often have different priorities in evaluating ICT. The most important reason for the lack of relevance of RCTs is that they are ill suited for investigating why and how a PCIS is being used, or not, and what the (often unplanned) effects and consequences are. Subsequently, our aim is to contribute to the discussion about the viability of qualitative versus quantitative methods in PCIS evaluation, by arguing for a specific integration of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The joint utilization of these methods, we claim, yields the richest results.",

After many years of internally building almost all components of a hospital clinical information system (HELP) at Intermountain Health Care, we changed our architectural approach as we chose to encompass ambulatory as well as acute care. We now seek to interface applications from a variety of sources (including some that we build ourselves) to a clinical data repository that contains a longitudinal electronic patient record. We have a total of 820 instances of interfaces to 51 different applications. We process nearly 2 million transactions per day via our interface engine and feel that the reliability of the approach is acceptable. Interface costs constitute about four percent of our total information systems budget. The clinical database currently contains records for 1.45 m patients and the response time for a query is 0.19 sec. Based upon our experience with both integrated (monolithic) and interfaced approaches, we conclude that for those with the expertise and resources to do so, the interfaced approach offers an attractive alternative to systems provided by a single vendor. We expect the advantages of this approach to increase as the costs of interfaces are reduced in the future as standards for vocabulary and messaging become increasingly mature and functional.",

Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the potential disparities in information systems in the application and data collection of health programs among Indonesian community health centers (CHCs) based on provinces and regions. This cross-sectional research used data from 9831 CHCs from the Health Facilities Research 2019 (RIFASKES). Significance was assessed using a chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The number of applications was depicted on a map using the spmap command with STATA version 14. It showed that region 2, which represented Java and Bali, was the best, followed by regions 1, which comprised Sumatra Island and its surroundings, and 3, Nusa Tenggara. The highest mean, equaling that of Java, was discovered in three provinces of region 1, namely, Jambi, Lampung, and Bangka Belitung. Furthermore, Papua and West Papua had less than 60% for all types of data-storage programs. Hence, there is a disparity in the health information system in Indonesia by province and region. The results of this analysis recommend future improvement of the CHCs' information systems.",

To describe the development of a NMDS in Thailand and explore the challenges of implementing it, including the issue of the comparability with data sets in other countries, primarily the United States of America. The process of developing a NMDS specific to Thailand is reviewed. Strategies for implementing this data set and important issues related to it are then discussed. Although a preliminary Thai NMDS has been identified, challenges associated with its development and implementation within the Thai National health information system remain. A Thai NMDS and its elements have been identified. The International Classification of Nursing Practice was translated and is to be used to implement the data set describing the nursing care of patients and their families. However, many issues, such as the need for conceptual translation and increasing nurses' involvement in the process, still need to be addressed in order to implement the data set successfully.",

    "title": "Modeling and eliciting organizational and information system requirements.",
    "abstract": "Two things have influenced organizational development more than any other: the coffee machine and the computer. The reason for this is that they mediate social relationships. Computers are also being used more and more within every type of organization in an attempt to make the organization faster, more cost efficient, and more competitive. With the adoption of such technology we need to recognize that computers encapsulate social values and can consequently be seen as instruments of power. Within the area of safety critical systems, such as a medical information system, it is vital that, when specifying and capturing requirements about the system, the technical and social values are identified and made explicit. In this paper an outline of a modeling framework will be presented that allows for the encapsulation and analysis of the social and technical aspects of an organizational information system. A modeling language and notation will be constructed and used to construct and analyze both the static and dynamic models of organizations and organizational behavior. The construction and analysis is achieved through the use of concepts such as role and responsibility. The conceptual modeling framework is then applied to a case study. This case study is based upon an accident and emergency department of an inner-city hospital situated within the center of Dublin, Ireland.",

    "title": "Nursing Information Systems Requirements: A Milestone for Patient Outcome and Patient Safety Improvement.",
    "abstract": "Considering the integral role of understanding users' requirements in information system success, this research aimed to determine functional requirements of nursing information systems through a national survey. Delphi technique method was applied to conduct this study through three phases: focus group method modified Delphi technique and classic Delphi technique. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the proposed requirements within 15 general hospitals in Iran. Forty-three of 76 approved requirements were clinical, and 33 were administrative ones. Nurses' mean agreements for clinical requirements were higher than those of administrative requirements; minimum and maximum means of clinical requirements were 3.3 and 3.88, respectively. Minimum and maximum means of administrative requirements were 3.1 and 3.47, respectively. Research findings indicated that those information system requirements that support nurses in doing tasks including direct care, medicine prescription, patient treatment management, and patient safety have been the target of special attention. As nurses' requirements deal directly with patient outcome and patient safety, nursing information systems requirements should not only address automation but also nurses' tasks and work processes based on work analysis.",

    "title": "A secure user anonymity-preserving three-factor remote user authentication scheme for the telecare medicine information systems.",
    "abstract": "Recent advanced technology enables the telecare medicine information system (TMIS) for the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and also to access medical services over the Internet of mobile networks. Several remote user authentication schemes have been proposed in the literature for TMIS. However, most of them are either insecure against various known attacks or they are inefficient. Recently, Tan proposed an efficient user anonymity preserving three-factor authentication scheme for TMIS. In this paper, we show that though Tan's scheme is efficient, it has several security drawbacks such as (1) it fails to provide proper authentication during the login phase, (2) it fails to provide correct updation of password and biometric of a user during the password and biometric update phase, and (3) it fails to protect against replay attack. In addition, Tan's scheme lacks the formal security analysis and verification. Later, Arshad and Nikooghadam also pointed out some security flaws in Tan's scheme and then presented an improvement on Tan's s scheme. However, we show that Arshad and Nikooghadam's scheme is still insecure against the privileged-insider attack through the stolen smart-card attack, and it also lacks the formal security analysis and verification. In order to withstand those security loopholes found in both Tan's scheme, and Arshad and Nikooghadam's scheme, we aim to propose an effective and more secure three-factor remote user authentication scheme for TMIS. Our scheme provides the user anonymity property. Through the rigorous informal and formal security analysis using random oracle models and the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool, we show that our scheme is secure against various known attacks, including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, our scheme is also efficient as compared to other related schemes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many authentication protocols have been presented using smartcard for the telecare medicine information system (TMIS). In 2014, Xu et al. put forward a two-factor mutual authentication with key agreement protocol using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, the authors have proved that the protocol is not appropriate for practical use as it has many problems (1) it fails to achieve strong authentication in login and authentication phases; (2) it fails to update the password correctly in the password change phase; (3) it fails to provide the revocation of lost/stolen smartcard; and (4) it fails to protect the strong replay attack. We then devised an anonymous and provably secure two-factor authentication protocol based on ECC. Our protocol is analyzed with the random oracle model and demonstrated to be formally secured against the hardness assumption of computational Diffie-Hellman problem. The performance evaluation demonstrated that our protocol outperforms from the perspective of security, functionality and computation costs over other existing designs.",

The main part of this paper focuses on the priority research considerations for occlusion. The paper concludes with a description of some alternatives to occlusion and future research needs. It is concluded that the occlusion test has some promise, however the empirical basis for occlusion is lacking.

    "abstract": "In this article, we have investigated how researchers use the data provided by the Brazilian Information System of Primary Care . We also searched, for the first time, studies that evaluated the quality and reliability of the information provided by the Primary Care Information System. An integrative review of the literature was performed using the keywords 'information systems, primary care and SIAB' on search databases, and 53 of 174 articles were selected. These publications were classified into two large subgroups: those using the Primary Care Information System as 'data source' and those that took it as the 'object of study'. The first group included 35 studies, 18 of which used demographic and social health data records, and nine described data about diseases, specifically hypertension and diabetes. These data were used by researchers for association with health indicators (20%) or comparison with other information systems (17%), sample or population calculus (9%), estimation of prevalence and characterization of the epidemiological profile of a population (26%) or, more generally, to carry out the assessment of health status (29%). The Primary Care Information System as the 'object of study' group included 18 works, describing the knowledge and practices of professionals in relation to the information system. These researchers pointed out issues in the process of production and information consolidation, mainly due to the lack of training and supervision of community health workers and bureaucratization of their work process. Although some issues in the quality of data provided by the Primary Care Information System were reported by researchers, these findings were not corroborated by two studies that assessed the reliability of information disclosed by this system. Despite changes in the Brazilian health policies, the issue of data quality in health information systems continues to be a challenge preventing data from being used for decision-making and knowledge production.",

In this study, we intended to identify users' adoption, utilization and helpfulness derived from HISs to determine the status of medical informatization by using 2016 Korean Physician Survey data. A total of 8564 members responded to the 2016 survey, we extracted the data of 6949 HISs related part for this study. As a result, about 68% of the self-employed physicians adopted the Order Communication System and Electronic Medical Records, while only one-third adopted the Picture Archiving and Communication System. Overall, the proportions of utilization and helpfulness of HISs were higher for females; for employed physicians or professors; for physicians working in hospitals; and for those specializing in surgical medicine. As applying information technology to the medical environment becomes more important, HIS will become a necessary requirement and the demand for information systems considering user and patient oriented information environments will be increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the HISs use environment considering not only technical aspects but also users' or patients' viewpoints. In that respect, this study will give a meaningful evidence of HIS related policies.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether the national information system on available beds in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) leads to fair distribution and good efficiency and quality of care. Two out of the ten NICUs in the Netherlands. Descriptive. Data were gathered through observations and 18 interviews with among others neonatologists, gynaecologists and paediatricians. Another 19 doctors were interviewed by phone after a patient they had referred was refused. Interviews were analysed by means of Kwalitan, a computer programme for analysis of qualitative research. When a patient could not be admitted in his own region, the information system was often used to find out which NICUs had a bed available. Sometimes a NICU was called that, according to the information system, did not have a place available. Reasons were: the information was not up to date and not all available beds were reported. This last reason had to do with the wish to keep a bed free for patients from the NICU's own region. Because most doctors were aware of this, they sometimes negotiated about beds, which was time-consuming. The information system was used often, but was working below optimal level, resulting in diminished efficiency. This was primarily caused by the priority given to patients of the own region, which had to do with quality of care considerations. The existing variation in use of the priority policy deserves attention from the viewpoint of procedural justice.",

Information was collected by a telephone survey of Trust information and clinical service managers. Most Trusts have a complex array of different information systems--the median number is four. Even where fully integrated systems are in place, these do not necessarily cover all data areas over the whole of the Trust's operations. Sixty-three percent of Trusts use more than one patient numbering system. Sixty-percent have implemented or formally piloted routine collection of outcome scoring, 51% using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS). A simple model suggested that the proposed data set could realistically be implemented nationally over a 4-year timescale.

HIS supports Universal Health Coverage (UHC) delivery by managing health data efficiently and aligning national health policies with organisational needs for a more patient-centred approach. This paper explores the barriers and opportunities in developing robust HIS software architectures in such healthcare settings. Key barriers include unreliable infrastructure, insufficient technical support, poor data quality, and financial constraints. However, opportunities for improvement exist, such as adopting interoperable systems, open-source standards, cloud-based solutions, modular upgrades, and capacity-building initiatives. Involving key stakeholders and developing strong policy frameworks are also essential. Future research should focus on improving global interoperability, data quality, sustainability, and scalability to ensure HIS can support UHC goals in resource-limited environments.",

The integration of business and medical applications in one single medical information system reduces financial exposure and permits the agency to expand its range of services to include high-value medical tests. The resulting close working relationship with local physicians will develop into a strong referral linkage. A medical information system, when applied expertly and designed to meet specific local requirements, may represent an important source of additional revenue for the agency and thus more than pay for itself.",

The essential elements of the system are demonstrated and the basic principles of the data processing apparatus type R300 are described. Here the author particularly enters the calculator-internal testing processes for elimination of codation and punching errors. Finally the further development of the information system provided is briefly sketched. The advantages of the use of electronic data processing result from 1. the simplificstion and unification of the information relations, 2. the reduction of writing work, 3. the centralised transmission of findings, 4. the increased security of data and 5. the possibility of mathematico-statistical evaluations of the stored data material. According to its basic conception the information system ISM may be used universally and it is possible to enlarge it.",

    "title": "Issues and challenges in the design of curriculum information systems.",
    "abstract": "Medical schools are increasingly using curriculum information systems to better manage their curricula, to incorporate alternative learning environments, to expand subject-specific instruction, or to adapt the curricula to the changing health care environment. A curriculum information system contains key features, selected by the system's designers, that describe the objectives, the specific content, and/or the educational activities that compose the curriculum. The underlying purpose of such a system is to document and describe the knowledge, behaviors, skills, attitudes, or activities students will be expected to develop or learn. While it might be ideal to have one system that would meet the needs of all possible users, the programming and maintenance requirements of such a single system would exceed most medical schools' resources. Thus, designers of curriculum information systems must first identify the primary intended-user group: students, faculty, or administrators. The system designed for one group will typically differ from the systems for other groups in the emphasis on and level of content detail and curriculum structure information. The general structure and purposes of curriculum information systems are expressed in three distinct system designs: a curriculum database (most helpful for administrators), a curriculum textbase (for faculty), and an electronic syllabus (for students). The authors describe these different designs, and they discuss challenges faced by system designers.",

Since this conception has not yet been realized into systems and modules commercially available, two university hospitals in Norway had to specify an alternative model for openness when they, in a joint project, screened the market for a new LIS. To be open, a LIS must be (1) based on main-trend hardware and system software running under a standardized operating system, (2) designed for network-based distributed computing, (3) have sufficient documentation available to local staff, (4) be configurable through parameters, tables and scripts, and (5) have general and configurable access mechanisms both to real-time processes and to the database. The present study describes the selection process and examines the compliance of the selected LIS (NetLab) with this model of openness. It is shown that local staff have been able to adapt this LIS to various and changing requirements in the laboratory.",

At district or even at neighbourhood level, data are collected on health status and factors related to health, including lifestyle, social and physical and environment, and the health care system. Data are collected from central and municipal Bureaus of Statistics, health care services, regional and municipal institutions, and by means of regularly performed local health surveys. The 84 neighbourhoods of the Rotterdam Municipality. In the local health information system three sorts of data are collected: data on health status, data on health risk factors, and socioeconomic and demographic data. Two examples of data on health status are given (mortality and mental health) which were analysed. These data show differences in health status between several districts in Rotterdam, which can be related to differences in socioeconomic status between these districts. Examples are given of the influence of the project on local health policy in Rotterdam. The main conclusion is that the local health information system has great promise as an information system to give direction to local health policy. However if this promise is to be fulfilled, it will be necessary to obtain data from more varied sources.",

The first step in designing an effective system is to describe the user's view of the system, a view that incorporates how the system will help users to manage information in their particular organizational environment. For nurses involved in designing a nursing information system, a useful way of considering the organizational environment is provided by Perrow. The organizational technologies described by Perrow can be viewed as different models of nursing practice, each with particular requirements for a knowledge base and a data base. Nurses can identify the model that most closely corresponds to actual or desired nursing practice in their agencies and use the model's associated knowledge base and data base requirements as a guide to specifying the information system to be developed.",

A free text radiology report and image search application known as Render was created to allow users to find pertinent cases for a variety of purposes. Render is a radiology report and image repository that pools researchable information derived from multiple systems in near real time with use of (a) Health Level 7 links for radiology information system data, (b) periodic file transfers from the picture archiving and communication system, and (c) the results of natural language processing (NLP) analysis. Users can perform more structured and detailed searches with this application by combining different imaging and patient characteristics such as examination number; patient age, gender, and medical record number; and imaging modality. Use of NLP analysis allows a more effective search for reports with positive findings, resulting in the retrieval of more cases and terms having greater relevance. From the retrieved results, users can save images, bookmark examinations, and navigate to an external search engine such as Google. Render has applications in the fields of radiology education, research, and clinical decision support.",

Consequently, care is ill adapted to meet the demand. The Multi-Source Information System is the basis of the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). It is dedicated to improve and organise our medical and epidemiological knowledge of ESRD and to aid public health decision-making in this area. The proposed approach is based on the datawarehouses. This model allows a unified vision of scattered data into distinct databases, for a better management, be it particular (patient follow-up) or global (regional follow-up), with a finality of aid in decision-making. Several categories of problems were considered: the global conception of the information system, the organisation of the datawarehouse, which offers different viewpoints of the data, the integration of heterogeneous data coming from different sources, data exchange and definition of a specific ontology.",

The purpose of this study was to validate information provided by two GIS databases, comparing the positional accuracy of food service places within a 1 km circular buffer surrounding 34 schools in Ontario, Canada. A commercial database (InfoCanada) and an online database (Yellow Pages) provided the addresses of food service places. Actual locations were measured using a global positioning system (GPS) device. The InfoCanada and Yellow Pages GIS databases provided the locations for 973 and 675 food service places, respectively. Overall, 749 (77.1%) and 595 (88.2%) of these were located in the field. The online database had a higher proportion of food service places found in the field. The GIS locations of 25% of the food service places were located within approximately 15 m of their actual location, 50% were within 25 m, and 75% were within 50 m. This validation study provided a detailed assessment of errors in the measurement of the location of food service places in the two databases. The location information was more accurate for the online database, however, when matching criteria were more conservative, there were no observed differences in error between the databases.",

The ESB bus high-availability architecture effectively eliminates multiple points of failure. Compared with the traditional dual-machine Cluster solution, the security is significantly improved. The nodes based on load balancing can be scaled horizontally according to the growth of the hospital's business volume. The construction of the ESB bus high-availability architecture effectively solves the performance and security issues caused by business growth, and provides practical experience for medical information colleagues.

Representation of rare diseases in Orphanet encompasses levels of increasing complexity: lexical (multilingual terminology), nosological (multihierarchical classifications), relational (annotations-epidemiological data-and classes of objects-genes, manifestations, and orphan drugs-integrated in a relational database), and interoperational (semantic interoperability). Rare disorders are mapped to International Classification of Diseases (10th version), SNOMED CT, MeSH, MedDRA, and UMLS. Genes are cross-referenced with HGNC, UniProt, OMIM, and Genatlas. A suite of tools allow for extraction of massive datasets giving different views that can be used in bioinformatics to answer complex questions, intended to serve the needs of researchers and the pharmaceutical industry in developing medicinal products for rare diseases. An ontology is under development. The Orphanet nomenclature is at the crossroads of scientific data repositories and of clinical terminology standards, and is suitable to be used as a standard terminology.",

This study aimed to estimate the progress made between these two evaluations. We performed an analysis of the secondary data from the evaluations of the NHIS, which was based on the comparison of the satisfaction level between the six components of this tool between 2009 and 2015, namely: resources, indicators, data sources, data management, information products, dissemination and use of data. Between 2009 and 2015, respondents' satisfaction level changed as follow: resouces 49% vs 61%; indicators 73% vs 88%; data sources 52% vs 61%; data management 41% vs 45%; information products 74% vs 77%; dissemination and use of data 51% vs 51%. In general the average score increased from 59% to 64% with \"satisfactory\" mark. Our study shows that the NHIS in the DR Congo has not changed significantly between 2009 and 2015 and that it couldn't provide real-time reliable health information for decision-making and health program planning.",

We calculated each variable's incompleteness (blank/unknown data) by municipality of residence. Based on these data, we calculated the percentage of municipalities with excellent completeness (> 95%), constructed a simple linear regression model, and calculated the determination coefficient. An important increase was observed in the percentage of municipalities with excellent completeness, highlighting the following variables: race/color, maternal schooling, maternal marital status, and number of prenatal visits. The study emphasizes the importance and relevance of using the SINASC database for analyzing maternal and child health conditions.",

    "abstract": "To ensure reliable telecare services some user authentication schemes for telecare medical information system (TMIS) have been presented in literature. These schemes are proposed with intent to regulate only authorized access to medical services so that medical information can be protected from misuse. Very recently Jiang et al. proposed a user authentication scheme for TMIS which they claimed to provide enhanced privacy. They made use of symmetric encryption/decryption with cipher block chaining mode (CBC) to achieve the claimed user privacy. Their scheme provides features like user anonymity and user un-traceability unlike its preceding schemes on which it is built. Unluckily, authors overlook some important aspects in designing their scheme due to which it falls short to resist user impersonation attack, guessing attacks and denial of service attack. Besides, its password change phase is not secure; air message confidentiality is at risk and also has some other drawbacks. Therefore, we propose an improved scheme free from problems observed in Jiang et al.'s scheme and more suitable for TMIS.",

The system generally was well accepted, but laboratory technologists differed in their responses to it. Technologists in some laboratories focused on work increases, whereas in other laboratories they emphasized improved information flow. The paper considers how changes in processes and outcomes of work might affect responses to a computer system. It also considers the implementation process, and suggests some areas where management could benefit from an improved understanding of responses to a computer information system.",

The updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems from the CDC were used to describe the purpose and operation of the system and to analyse its attributes for the period 1985-2003. For the evaluation of the sensitivity the regional database of antiretrovirals distribution was used. The HIV surveillance system of Navarra is confidential and name-based, and includes all HIV-infection cases diagnosed each year. The information sources of the system are: (a) all the laboratories in the public health system that perform the western blot test, and (b) hospital discharge registries. The system covers the entire population of Navarre (584,734 inhabitants). It uses the HIV case definition proposed by the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS. The system is well-accepted by the community and by all the stakeholders, including those providing data. By the end of 2003 it included 2302 HIV cases, and 98.8% of all patients who had ever received antiretrovirals in Navarra. The HIV information system of Navarra is simple, useful, well-accepted and highly sensitive. The information about antiretroviral distribution was useful for this evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Since the health information system (HIS) in public health care services in Serbia was introduced in 2009, it has gradually expanded. However, it is unclear how well the HIS components have developed and the whole system's stage of maturity. In June-September 2021, a maturity assessment of the Serbian HIS was conducted for the first time using the HIS Stages of Continuous Improvement (SOCI) toolkit. The toolkit measures HIS status across 5 HIS domains: leadership and governance, management and workforce, information and communication technology (ICT), standards and interoperability, and data quality and use. The domains were further divided into 13 components and 39 subcomponents whose maturity stage was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale, indicating the level of development: (1) emerging/ad hoc; (2) repeatable; (3) defined; (4) managed; and (5) optimized. The toolkit was applied in a working group of 32 professionals and experts who were engaged in developing the new national eHealth strategy and action plan. The overall maturity score of the Serbian HIS was 1.6, which indicates a low level. The highest baseline score (2) was given to the standards and interoperability domain, and the lowest (1.1) was given to ICT infrastructure. The remaining 3 domains (leadership and governance, Management and Workforce, and Data Quality and Use) were similarly rated (1.7, 1.7, and 1.6, respectively). A baseline assessment of the maturity level of Serbian HIS indicates that the majority of components are between the emerging/ad hoc stage and repeatable, which represent isolated, ad hoc efforts, with some basic processes in place and existing and accessible policies. This exercise provided an opportunity to address identified weaknesses in the upcoming national eHealth strategy.",

    "abstract": "Getting a new concept or project up and running is never an insignificant undertaking. In many cases, however, the successful completion of a project signals the start of the \"real work\" in which the greater challenge is in turning that initial success and investment into results that can be sustained over the long-term. This was the challenge facing Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) once they developed and deployed the Wait Time Information System (WTIS) on behalf of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC). With the launch of the WTIS, the government, Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs), hospitals and patients had--for the first time--standardized, near real-time data to make more informed healthcare decisions and better manage access to critical health services. But much more work was ahead. The next step was to begin leveraging the technology and the wealth of data it provided to help drive significant performance improvements within the overall health system. The time had come to shift gears from an IT deployment project to a sustainable operations and information management program that could continue to provide value for the province. This article looks at the future of the WTIS and describes the journey CCO has taken to establish a permanent Wait Time Information Program.

In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information. To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed. With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient. Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place. After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information. The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.",

    "abstract": "Robust, flexible, and integrated health information (HIS) systems are essential to achieving national and international goals in health and development. Such systems are still uncommon in most low and middle income countries. This article describes a first-phase activity in Tanzania to integrate the country's vertical health management information system with the help of an interoperability layer that enables cross-program data exchange. From 2014 to 2019, the Tanzanian government and partners implemented a five-step procedure based on the \"Mind the GAPS\" (governance, architecture, program management, and standards) framework and using both proprietary and open-source tools. In collaboration with multiple stakeholders, the team developed the system to address major data challenges via four fully documented \"use case scenarios\" addressing data exchange among hospitals, between services and the supply chain, across digital data systems, and within the supply chain reporting system. This work included developing the architecture for health system data exchange, putting a middleware interoperability layer in place to facilitate the exchange, and training to support use of the system and the data it generates. Tanzania successfully completed the five-step procedure for all four use cases. Data exchange is currently enabled among 15 separate information systems, and has resulted in improved data availability and significant time savings. The government has adopted the health information exchange within the national strategy for health care information, and the system is being operated and managed by Tanzanian officials. Developing an integrated HIS requires a significant time investment; but ultimately benefit both programs and patients. Tanzania's experience may interest countries that are developing their HIS programs.",

    "title": "[Information system in primary health care].",
    "abstract": "The Croatian Ministry of Health started a health care system computerization project aimed at strengthening the collaboration among health care institutions, expert groups and individual health care providers. A tender for informatic system for Primary Health Care (PHC) general practice, pediatrics and gynecology, a vital prerequisite for project realization, has now been closed. Some important reasons for undertaking the project include rationalization of drug utilization, savings through a reduced use of specialists, consultants and hospitalization, then achievement of better cooperation, work distribution, result linking, data quality improvement (by standardization), and ensuring proper information-based decision making. Keeping non-standardized and thus difficult to process data takes too much time of the PHC team time. Since, however, a vast amount of data are collected on only a few indicators, some important information may remain uncovered. Although decisions made by health authorities should rely on evidence and processed information, the authorities spend most of the time working with raw data from which their decisions ultimately derive. The Informatic Technology (IT) in PHC is expected to enable a different approach. PHC teams should be relieved from the tedious task of data gathering and the authorities enabled to work with the information rather than data. The Informatics Communication Technology (ICT) system consists of three parts: hardware (5000 personal computers for work over the Internet), operative system with basic software (editor, etc.), and PHC software for PHC teams. At the national level (National Public Health Informatics System), a software platform will be built for data collection, analysis and distribution. This data collection will be based on the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2) standard to ensure the utilization of medical records and quality assessment. The system permits bi-directional data exchange between a central database and sources at different levels, across the spectrum from basic PHC teams to local authorities. This will enable data collection control, comparisons with national averages and prompt distribution of information over the Internet. The investment into IT is a strategic imperative having no alternative. A cost/benefit analysis has shown its operation in the PHC system to return the investment in two years. As defined according to the Project priorities (with measurable objectives), the use of new technologies will be introduced by stages.",

    "title": "Understanding and valuing the broader health system benefits of Uganda's national Human Resources for Health Information System investment.",
    "abstract": "To address the need for timely and comprehensive human resources for health (HRH) information, governments and organizations have been actively investing in electronic health information interventions, including in low-resource settings. The economics of human resources information systems (HRISs) in low-resource settings are not well understood, however, and warrant investigation and validation. This case study describes Uganda's Human Resources for Health Information System (HRHIS), implemented with support from the US Agency for International Development, and documents perceptions of its impact on the health labour market against the backdrop of the costs of implementation. Through interviews with end users and implementers in six different settings, we document pre-implementation data challenges and consider how the HRHIS has been perceived to affect human resources decision-making and the healthcare employment environment. This multisite case study documented a range of perceived benefits of Uganda's HRHIS through interviews with end users that sought to capture the baseline (or pre-implementation) state of affairs, the perceived impact of the HRHIS and the monetary value associated with each benefit. In general, the system appears to be strengthening both demand for health workers (through improved awareness of staffing patterns) and supply (by improving licensing, recruitment and competency of the health workforce). This heightened ability to identify high-value employees makes the health sector more competitive for high-quality workers, and this elevation of the health workforce also has broader implications for health system performance and population health. Overall, it is clear that HRHIS end users in Uganda perceived the system to have significantly improved day-to-day operations as well as longer term institutional mandates. A more efficient and responsive approach to HRH allows the health sector to recruit the best candidates, train employees in needed skills and deploy trained personnel to facilities where there is real demand. This cascade of benefits can extend the impact and rewards of working in the health sector, which elevates the health system as a whole.",

It has been shown that such web based virus identification approach provides results with high confidence in those cases where identification matrix uses large number of independent characters. Protein sequence data for animal viruses have been analyzed and oligopeptides specific to each virus family and also specific to each virus species are identified for several viruses. These peptides thus could be used to identify the virus and to assign the virus family with high confidence showing the usefulness of sequence data in virus identification.",

The Geographical Information System (GIS) has recently become one of the most common methods utilized to provide disease information technology with computer supported technology in many countries. The most important qualities of GIS are the formation of a powerful database, continual updating and rapid provision of coordination related to units. Many factors are evaluated at the same time by the system and also, results from analysis of data related to disease and their causes could reduce or prevent economical losses due to parasitic disease.

This investigation reports the results from a survey, conducted among the persons involved in the start-up process. The aim of this study is to generate knowledge contributing to the clarification of the motivations, expectations, and intentions underlying the development and implementation of the system. The decision to implement a classification and information system for pharmaceuticals was the result of a combination of several driving forces, mainly political pressure and a possibility to increase the industries' goodwill, while at the same time keeping the process under the industries' control. The expected possible effects of the system, other than increased goodwill, are according to this survey assumed to be low. The system offers little guidance for end-users in the substitution of one pharmaceutical for another. One possible reason for this could be that LIF needs to observe the interests of all its members' and should not affect competition. The affiliation of the involved actors correlates to how these actors view and value the system, but this has not hampered the collaborative process to develop and implement it.",

For efficient exchange of information, mutual cooperation between all departments and medical specialists in the hospital is of great importance. The development of a sufficient hospital information system has to start with the composition of an information design, based on the concept of an open hospital database with connections to subsystems of the different departments and medical specialisms. Within this design basic, organizational, management and (medical) knowledge-providing programs can be applied. General, medical, scientific and organizational aspects of electronic support in internal medicine are discussed with some practical examples. A brief comment is made on the necessity of using code numbers for diagnoses.",

Facility directors, directors of nursing, information system managers, and frontline staff at each facility were targeted, and questionnaires were developed for each to assess factors viewed as important to successful implementation. A convergence was found in recommended action steps reported across sites to facilitate introduction and implementation of new RAI/MDS software. An example of how benchmarking results were used to develop an implementation plan is provided. Benchmarking provided a useful methodology for identifying best practices to guide implementation planing for adoption of a new computerized RAI/MDS system in the current trial. The benchmarking steps described are replicable and can be used to guide implementation of other new systems in the nursing home setting.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral health agencies will soon implement automated information-management systems to support their administrative, financial, and clinical care functions. Assessing current information-management capabilities and delineating future needs are prerequisite to recommending a specific information technology solution. Quantifying the discrepancy between current information-management capabilities and future requirements highlights the areas of greatest unmet need for information management. Selecting an information system that addresses the most critical areas of unmet need is a prudent purchase decision. This article describes the results of a process to assess the information-management requirements for agencies that were considering implementation of an integrated behavioral health information-management system. The assessment revealed that these agencies already employed automated systems to manage most financial functions and many administrative functions. Few agencies, however, utilized automated systems to manage clinical care functions. Selection of a behavioral health electronic medical record (EMR) effectively addressed clinical care information-management needs without duplicating existing financial and administrative management functions. Also, the EMR included features that addressed some administrative functions for which a discrepancy between current capabilities and future needs was found. Selecting an EMR instead of an integrated behavioral health information system was associated with a significant reduction in information system acquisition costs.",

The goal of this paper was to propose a standard to pharmaceutical semisolid and liquid external use forms preparation. First was performed a study to check the characteristics on drug preparation at different establishments. Then, a standardization proposal was specified represented by flowcharts, including sequence, features and drug elaboration restrictions. Relevant variables were also identified and defined. Active's name, pH and compatibilities are some examples. Flowcharts cover prescription analysis, actives compatibility verification, solubility, pharmaceutical incipient addition and other aspects that are important considering drug preparation. These flowcharts were validated by compounding pharmacy specialists applying Delphi Method. An Information System to support compounding pharmacist's decision and help actives selection was developed, using the standard proposed, and the defined variables as knowledge base. Six common medical prescriptions, generally elaborated with wrong characteristics were used to evaluate the system. To all of them, the system offered a correct action plan to drug elaboration.",

The fact that different communities have different systems makes it difficult to share information and data between different CHISs. To explore a solution for addressing this problem, we constructed a demonstration CHIS in Beijing's Dongcheng District. This system is based on the Software-as-a-Service model, in which a central data center is used to store users' health records and to provide different services. This system provides a comprehensive platform combining disease prevention, health protection, medical care, rehabilitation, health education, and family planning. In this article, we first show the challenge of implementing e-health-oriented CHIS in China, then we briefly introduce our solution, and finally we share our experience learned from the modern CHIS implementation practice.",

Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital Group (SPPHG) is a network of hospitals with different levels of expertise, and all the members with radiotherapy form a radiotherapy network (RTN). Addressing the inadequacy and imbalance of radiotherapy services of Sichuan Province, China, a tele-radiotherapy system for RTN-SPPHG is designed, which includes the business model and corresponding technical implementation of an information system. In the RTN-SPPHG, a distributed remote collaboration business model is explored and a tele-radiotherapy information system is customized for this telemedicine model. Both the business model and tailored information system were evaluated in actual use. Based on the tele-radiotherapy system of RTN-SPPHG, multitype hospitals are linked together and serve as a whole. Through the internet, the experience of experts of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital is effectively deployed to member hospitals at the grassroot level. A close-knit medical alliance based on a tele-radiotherapy system should be a way to rapidly improve radiotherapy services and promote the homogenization of service in a region.",

SIMAN was thus designed to collect all relevant information on outbreaks of animal diseases and to provide a useful tool for the management of activities to be implemented in emergencies. SIMAN is able to collect and report information concerning suspected or confirmed animal outbreaks in a consistent way and allows veterinary services to enter data electronically, instead of using paperwork, within the framework of the process of e-government and dematerialisation of the administrative acts. Data are immediately accessible for local and national authorities. The system provides the relevant national authorities with information relative to the planning of control measures in case epidemic emergencies. SIMAN is part of the e-government process that involves all public administrations of the European Union (EU) and refers to the use of information and communication technologies for the digital processing of documents so as to simplify the system and to make administrative procedures on the Internet much easier to follow.",

Information is indispensable for effective management and development of health services and therefore considered as an important operational asset or resource. A Health Information System is mainly required to support management and operations at four levels: namely transactional and functional; operational control; management planning and control; and strategic planning. To provide the necessary information needs of users at these levels of management in the health care system, a structured information system coupled with appropriate information technology is required. Adequate and relevant information is needed regarding population characteristics, resources available and expended, output and outcome of health care activities. Additionally information needs to be reliable, accurate, timely, easily accessible and presented in a compact and meaningful form. With a well-planned health information system health authorities would be in a position to provide a quality, cost-effective and efficient health service for as many people as need it, optimal utilisation of resources and to maintain and improve the community's health status.",

This strategic plan was developed by members of the Ontario Nursing Informatics Group (ONIG), an affiliated group of the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO), in response to priorities set by its membership. This project management approach is an overview of the step-by-step approach described in the workbook Framework for Planning Nursing Information Systems [1]. 2. PLANNING PROCESS. The first phase, \"Getting Ready,\" of the planning process emphasizes the importance of developing a strategic vision and preparing a business case. The objectives to be attained include a review of the current healthcare trends and state-of-the-art, the development of commitment from managers, and the establishment of a project structure. Secondly, one must \"Analyze the Needs\" of the health care facility. The current system is reviewed and future information requirements are defined. To facilitate this analysis, a detailed review of the current system is undertaken, the current system costs are identified, the technical and functional requirements are determined, and anticipated costs and benefits are outlined. Phase three, \"Choosing a System,\" involves selecting system(s) that best meet the needs of the healthcare facility. A detailed system review is undertaken; it includes planning for the selection process, developing a request for information and/or a request for proposal, attending vendor demonstrations, attending site visits, and negotiating the contract. \"Implementing the System\" outlines the project plan for integrating the selected system in the work environment. The activities involved in managing the change process include the identification of the project team, defining the project plan, reviewing the budget, tailoring the system to meet the health care facility requirements, developing policies and procedures, outlining educational requirements, installing new hardware and software, piloting the system, and managing the transition. During the \"Going Live\" phase, the new system is integrated in the health care facility work activities. To manage this transition, an implementation checklist is developed, all staff that will be using some component of the system is educated, and the old system is converted to the new system. Following implementation of the system, a preventative \"Maintenance\" program must be developed to ensure the optimum level of functioning of the new system. This includes maintenance of the healthcare facility processes implemented during the conversion and maintenance of the application software and hardware. The last phase of the planning process is \"Continuous Quality Improvement\" (CQI). This phase stresses the importance of evaluating the system on an ongoing basis. A CQI program should be developed, on-going review must be scheduled, and the evaluation documented and communicated.",

Sample outputs and statistics from the system for one district are presented. The implementation dynamics and the preliminary performance of the system are discussed. The development of the mHMIS was a collaborative effort between the provincial Department of Health, the medical university and the Danidasupported Madhya Pradesh Basic Health Services project. One of India's most socioeconomically backward provinces, Madhya Pradesh is spread over an area of 304,000 km(2), and has a population of 60.4 million distributed in its 55,392 villages and 394 towns. A primary survey of all healthcare providers (public and private) in the province was done to map these. Secondary data sources for sociodemographic information (census of India), vital statistics and health program indicators (health worker records) were used in developing the system. The process of mapping from obtaining hand-drawn maps of the villages from the commissioner, land records, to final digitizing is also described. Sample outputs and statistics for one district (Chindwara) from the system are presented. There were 20.35 trained doctors in rural areas and 72.78 in urban areas per 100,000 population. Preliminary experience after a year, advantages, constraints (both systemic limitations and weakness in the mHMIS) to optimal usage, and future prospects for use in this setting are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Hospital information systems (HISs) are becoming more important and covering more parts in daily hospital operations as order-entry systems become popular and electronic charts are introduced. Thus, HISs today need to be able to provide necessary services for hospital operations for a 24-h day, 365 days a year. The provision of services discussed here does not simply mean the availability of computers, in which all that matters is that the computer is functioning. It means the provision of necessary information for hospital operations by the computer software, and we will call it the availability of software services. HISs these days are mostly client-server systems. To increase availability of software services in these systems, it is not enough to just use system structures that are highly reliable in existing host-centred systems. Four main components which support availability of software services are network systems, client computers, server computers, and application software. In this paper, we suggest how to structure these four components to provide the minimum requested software services even if a part of the system stops to function. The network system should be double-protected in stratus using Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) as its base network. Client computers should be fat clients with as much application logic as possible, and reference information which do not require frequent updates (master files, for example) should be replicated in clients. It would be best if all server computers could be double-protected. However, if that is physically impossible, one database file should be made accessible by several server computers. Still, at least the basic patients' information and the latest clinical records should be double-protected physically. Application software should be tested carefully before introduction. Different versions of the application software should always be kept and managed in case the new version has problems. If a hospital information system is designed and developed with these points in mind, it's availability of software services should increase greatly.",

    "abstract": "One of the tasks of information management is systematic planning of a Hospital Information System (HIS). However, the description and the analysis of the current state of a HIS typically create high costs and are not well supported. The aim of this paper is therefore to report about the specification of a reference model for the domain layer of a Hospital Information System. We developed a reference model for the domain layer of a Hospital Information System based on the requirements index for information processing in hospitals for describing the enterprise functions, and based on the object types from the Health Level 7 Reference Information Model (HL7-RIM) for describing the entity types. The developed reference model is a comprehensive hierarchic model of the enterprise functions of hospital information systems. The central enterprise function \"patient treatment\" for example is described with 35 enterprise functions and 38 entity types on a three-level hierarchy. Reference models provide a kind of modelling patterns that can easily be used and adapted to a respective Information System. The availability of reference models should therefore provide a highly valuable contribution to keep the costs for modelling Hospital Information Systems low. We will start to evaluate the reference model by using it in the description of the information systems of a University Clinic of the Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten GmbH (TILAK), Austria. If this pre-test is positive, it is planned to extend the use of the reference model to the overall Hospital Information System of the TILAK.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate Use Case Maps (UCMs) as a technique for Requirements Engineering (RE) in the development of information systems with functions for spatial analyses in inter-organizational public health settings. In this study, Participatory Action Research (PAR) is used to explore the UCM notation for requirements elicitation and to gather the opinions of the users. The Delphi technique is used to reach consensus in the construction of UCMs. The results show that UCMs can provide a visualization of the system's functionality and in combination with PAR provide a sound basis for gathering requirements in inter-organizational settings. UCMs were found to represent a suitable level for describing the organization and the dynamic flux of information including spatial resolution to all stakeholders. Moreover, by using PAR, the voices of the users and their tacit knowledge is intercepted. Further, UCMs are found useful in generating intuitive requirements by the creation of use cases. With UCMs and PAR it is possible to study the effects of design changes in the general information display and the spatial resolution in the same context. Both requirements on the information system in general and the functions for spatial analyses are possible to elicit when identifying the different responsibilities and the demands on spatial resolution associated to the actions of each administrative unit. However, the development process of UCM is not well documented and needs further investigation and formulation of guidelines.",

Here, the medical information event in a basic data unit is handled by a medical information system. The timing of decision making and treatment for a patient in the processing of his medical information is sometimes very critical. The time-oriented data warehouse was developed, to provide a search feature on the time axis. Our medical information event model has a unique simple data structure. PC-ORDERING2000 developed by NEC, which used Oracle, had about 600 pages of tables. However, we reduced these 600 complicated data structures to one unique and simple event model. By means of shifting clinical data from the old type order entry system into the new order entry system of the medical information event model, we produced a simple and flexible system, and the easy secondary use of clinical data of patients was realized. Evaluation of our system revealed heightened data retrieval efficiency and shortened response time 1:600 at a terminal, owing to the 1:600 reduction of the number of tables as mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "Lean management applied to healthcare aims at creating maximum value for patients by reducing waste and waits. It puts the patient's needs center stage, emphasizes employee involvement and continuous improvement. To realize this, visual tools such as the huddle board or the patient board are implemented in hospital wards. The boards are currently realized by whiteboards or flipcharts, which leads to duplicated data entries and loss of information. The objective of this work is to introduce a concept for digitalizing the patient board and integrate with a hospital information system (HIS) for improved data availability. Data on appointments, personnel planning and master patient data can be directly accessed from the HIS database. A digital patient board has several benefits: data can be collected from information systems, making it obsolete to record information several times. Even more functionalities, in particular, those supporting the communication between a patient and a healthcare team can be included by means of a digital board which improves patient involvement.",

    "title": "Information systems integration in radiology.",
    "abstract": "Advances in information systems and technology in conjunction with outside forces requiring improved reporting are driving sweeping changes in the practice of radiology. In most academic radiology departments, there can be at least five separate information systems in daily use, a clinical picture archiving and communication system (PACS), a hospital information system (HIS), a radiology information system (RIS), a voice-recognition dictation system, and an electronic teaching/research file system. A PACS will have incomplete, incorrect, and inconsistent data if manual data entry is used. Correct routing of studies for diagnostic reporting and clinical review requires accurate information about the study type and the referring physician or service, often not easily entered manually. An HIS is a hospital-wide information system used to access patient information, reports from various services, and billing information. The RIS is typically a system specifically designed to place radiology orders, to receive interpretations, and to prepare bills for patients. Voice-recognition systems automatically transcribe the radiologist's dictation, eliminating transcription delays. Another system that is needed in a teaching hospital holds images and data for research and education. Integration of diverse systems must be performed to provide the functionality required by an electronic radiology department and the services it supports. Health Level 7 (HL7) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) have enabled sharing of data among systems and can be used as the building blocks for truly integrated systems, but the user community and manufacturers need to specify the types of functionality needed to build clinically useful systems. Although technology development has produced the tools for interoperability for clinical and research/educational use, more work needs to be done to define the types of interaction that needs to be performed to realize the potential of these systems.",

    "title": "The computer in general practice.",
    "abstract": "Interest in computers is becoming commonplace in general practice. Many practices in the UK have already installed complete systems, others are in the processes of developing them. Most general practitioners will buy complete systems off-the-shelf, but a small minority will do their own systems design and programming. The computer, as part of an information system for general practice, will go through three phases: the cross-indexing system, the narrative record, and the decision aid. All systems currently installed are at the level of the cross-indexing system. This retains the traditional clinical record as the main repository of information stored in hard copy, but provides convenient and entropy proof methods of identifying cohorts of patients by such characteristics as age, sex, social class, geographical distribution, or disease entity. The purposes for this will be preventive medicine, quality control, administrative planning, educational planning, and possibly research. These functions replace manual systems which have been in use by a small number of general practitioners for twenty years, but which have never gained general acceptance partly because of their clumsiness and partly because they were seen as research tools. The step to the narrative record will not be worth the investment in resource or energy if it is purely to store the current undisciplined paper record in electronic medium. It will only be worthwhile if two preconditions are met: firstly, that some standardized form of recording such as problem-orientated medical records are accepted and, secondly, if it is accepted by the doctor that he is handing over a certain amount of control to the system which will prompt, cue and remind him of things that have to be done.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To characterize question types that residents received on overnight shifts and what information sources were used to answer them. Across 30 overnight shifts, questions asked of on-call senior residents, question askers' roles, and residents' responses were documented. External sources were noted. 158 of 397 questions (39.8%) related to the plan of care, 53 (13.4%) to medical knowledge, 48 (12.1%) to taskwork knowledge, and 44 (11.1%) to the current condition of patients. For 351 (88.4%) questions residents provided specific, direct answers or visited the patient. For 16 of these, residents modeled or completed the task. For 216 questions, residents used previous knowledge or their own clinical judgment. Residents solicited external information sources for 118 questions and only a single source for 77 (65.3%) of them. For the 118, most questions concerned either the plan of care or the patient's current condition and were asked by interns and nurses (those with direct patient care responsibilities). Resident physicians serve as an information system and they often specifically answer the question using previous knowledge or their own clinical judgment, suggesting that askers are contacting an appropriately knowledgeable person. However, they do need to access patient information such as the plan of care. They also serve an educator role and answer many knowledge-related questions. As synchronous verbal communications continue to be important pathways for information flow, informaticians need to consider the relationship between such communications and workflow in the development of healthcare support tools.",

Each DC was matched with a CLB through manual review. Of the 11,182 births in SINASC, 69 duplicate CLB and 3 CLB without the mother's name were eliminated. The 211 SIM/infant death investigations showed the following: 25 CLB (35.2% of deaths), 33 CLB (55.9% of deaths), 57 CLB (75% of deaths), and 4 CLB (80% of deaths). For 92 DC (43.6% of 211 deaths), matching was not possible, since there was no CLB. Infant death investigations were an important complementary source of 53 DC and 17 CLB.

    "abstract": "Foundational to a well-functioning health system is a strong routine health information system (RHIS) that informs decisions and actions at all levels of the health system. In the context of decentralization across low- and middle-income countries, RHIS has the promise of supporting sub-national health staff to take data-informed actions to improve health system performance. However, there is wide variation in how \"RHIS data use\" is defined and measured in the literature, impeding the development and evaluation of interventions that effectively promote RHIS data use. An integrative review methodology was used to: (1) synthesize the state of the literature on how RHIS data use in low- and middle-income countries is conceptualized and measured; (2) propose a refined RHIS data use framework and develop a common definition for RHIS data use; and (3) propose improved approaches to measure RHIS data use. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 2009 and 2021 investigating RHIS data use. A total of 45 articles, including 24 articles measuring RHIS data use, met the inclusion criteria. Less than half of included articles (42%) explicitly defined RHIS data use. There were differences across the literature whether RHIS data tasks such as data analysis preceded or were a part of RHIS data use; there was broad consensus that data-informed decisions and actions were essential steps within the RHIS data use process. Based on the synthesis, the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework was refined to specify the steps of the RHIS data use process. Conceptualizing RHIS data use as a process that includes data-informed actions emphasizes the importance of actions in improving health system performance. Future studies and implementation strategies should be designed with consideration for the different support needs for each step of the RHIS data use process.",

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality methodology was followed to create the infrastructure and registry. The database needs assessment survey was completed by 99 individuals and most respondents wanted to collect more standardized data than currently available in existing systems. Satisfaction with the existing systems was rated low. The COR was created and a pilot test was successful. The COR was implemented and has been functioning for more than 2 years. By identifying physicians needs, evaluating existing technology and incorporating a multidisciplinary team, the COR was created and implemented to maintain clinical data on a variety of patient diagnoses and outcomes using a single technology platform that enhances potential research collaborations and minimizes redundant data entry and data collection, such as quality of life assessments for the patients.",

    "abstract": "The authors describe a comprehensive system for public health surveillance for the United States based on a network of data systems ranging from population surveys and physician-based records to electronically linked laboratory and administrative data. They also discuss traditional uses of surveillance data, legal and ethical issues associated with using data from any surveillance system (particularly the tension between individual privacy and the public right to a healthful environment), and factors impeding the development of a comprehensive system. Just as provisional data on notifiable diseases are critical in protecting communities from disease, data from other information systems should be applied to prevention practice with the same urgency. The major barriers to a successful comprehensive, nationwide, integrated public health surveillance and information system are a lack of appreciation for the value of high-quality provisional surveillance data and a weak societal commitment to public health.",

    "abstract": "Patient Safety Information Systems (PSIS) are prerequisite for any patient safety program. The purpose of the study was to review PSISs in developed countries and to customize a preliminary framework for such systems for Iran. Three developed countries in the field of patient safety including the USA, England and Australia were selected and their PSISs or reporting systems were studied. In addition, 15 unstructured interviews were conducted with Iranian informants. In the developed countries, specific regulations have been formulated regarding reporting and recording of patient safety incidents. Based on these regulations, a variety of patient safety data needs to be collected. In addition, the reportable incidents, the mechanisms of data analysis, the entities involved in the system, tools and technologies as well as feedback mechanisms have been defined well. In the field of patient safety, the Iranian health system is still in its infancy and lacks a formal information system for collecting, analyzing, disseminating and sharing patient safety information. Based on other countries' experiences, a preliminary framework for an Iranian PSIS was suggested. Developing a PSIS for Iranian hospitals is crucially needed. In this regard, Iranian hospitals and health authorities should develop standardized data sets, standard forms for reporting, mechanisms for data analysis and feedback modes.",

    "title": "Design and development of a medical big data processing system based on Hadoop.",
    "abstract": "Secondary use of medical big data is increasingly popular in healthcare services and clinical research. Understanding the logic behind medical big data demonstrates tendencies in hospital information technology and shows great significance for hospital information systems that are designing and expanding services. Big data has four characteristics--Volume, Variety, Velocity and Value (the 4 Vs)--that make traditional systems incapable of processing these data using standalones. Apache Hadoop MapReduce is a promising software framework for developing applications that process vast amounts of data in parallel with large clusters of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner. With the Hadoop framework and MapReduce application program interface (API), we can more easily develop our own MapReduce applications to run on a Hadoop framework that can scale up from a single node to thousands of machines. This paper investigates a practical case of a Hadoop-based medical big data processing system. We developed this system to intelligently process medical big data and uncover some features of hospital information system user behaviors. This paper studies user behaviors regarding various data produced by different hospital information systems for daily work. In this paper, we also built a five-node Hadoop cluster to execute distributed MapReduce algorithms. Our distributed algorithms show promise in facilitating efficient data processing with medical big data in healthcare services and clinical research compared with single nodes. Additionally, with medical big data analytics, we can design our hospital information systems to be much more intelligent and easier to use by making personalized recommendations.",

    "title": "[The Effectiveness of the Use by Nurses of the Interdisciplinary Care Information System].",
    "abstract": "Using patient records and information systems not only improves collaboration among healthcare professionals but also enhances patient-care outcomes. Based on this, inter-professional collaboration has been increasingly applied in patient care in recent years. To explore the acceptance of nurses of the inter-disciplinary care system, the patient-record completion rate, and the consultation response rate. A questionnaire was developed based on Davis Technology Acceptance Model and DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model that included the key elements of system success (system quality and information quality) and attitudes toward use (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). A patient record checklist and the number of consultation responses were collected as well. This study collected 185 completed questionnaires and 817 copies of patient records as well as the associated consultation response rates. The results revealed that nurses held positive attitudes and that questionnaire variables were positively correlated. Additionally, perceived usefulness explained 60% of the variation in attitude toward use. In addition, the rate of completion for patient records in subcategories increased from 41% to 62%. Finally, while the overall team response rate of the social-worker and respiratory groups increased, that of the rehabilitation group decreased. Nurses accept the need to use inter-disciplinary care systems to enhance the completeness of patient records. However, the decreased consultation response rate may relate to the inability to update system functions. It is suggested that an auto-consultation response function be designed to provide reminders in order to improve the consultation response rate.",

In this study which is handled within the frame of providing information flow among professionals in a disaster case, to supply the coordination of healthcare team and transferring complete information to specified people at real time, Microsoft Access database and SQL query language were used to inform database applications. System was prepared on Microsoft .Net platform using C# language. Disaster information system-medical module was designed to be used in disaster area, field hospital, nearby hospitals, temporary inhabiting areas like tent city, vehicles that are used for dispatch, and providing information flow between medical officials and data centres. For fast recording of the disaster victim data, accessing to database which was used by health care professionals was provided (or granted) among analysing process steps and creating minimal datasets. Database fields were created in the manner of giving opportunity to enter new data and search old data which is recorded before disaster. Web application which provides access such as data entry to the database and searching towards the designed interfaces according to the login credentials access level. In this study, homepage and users' interfaces which were built on database in consequence of system analyses were provided with www.afmedinfo.com web site to the user access. With this study, a recommendation was made about how to use disaster-based information systems in the field of health. Awareness has been developed about the fact that disaster information system should not be perceived only as an early warning system. Contents and the differences of the health care practices of disaster information systems were revealed. A web application was developed supplying a link between the user and the database to make date entry and data query practices by the help of the developed interfaces.",

    "abstract": "At the turn of the century, several major efforts were initiated to combat HIV/AIDS and other major epidemics affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They were accompanied by initiatives to enable recipient countries to collect and use data to guide their public health programmes. These health information systems (HIS) typify systems in that they have multiple interacting components, and they are embedded within larger systems. Components of a larger system act as the context for all lower-level systems. Their effects can be pervasive, and thus be taken for granted or regarded as unchangeable. We identify four contextual factors that affect efforts to strengthen HIS: hierarchical roles, aid funding, corruption, and competing priorities. We provide examples of each as experienced by those working to strengthen HIS in LMICs. Each of these contextual factors can seriously diminish the effectiveness of HIS strengthening efforts and their long-term sustainability. We propose research questions about each that would enable those engaged in HIS strengthening to work effectively and sustainably.",

    "abstract": "The initial version of the Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems was created to facilitate explicit representation of medical logic in a form that could be easily composed and interpreted by clinical experts in order to facilitate clinical decision support (CDS). Because of demand from knowledge engineers and programmers to improve functionality related to complex use cases, the Arden Syntax evolved to include features typical of general programming languages but that were specialized to meet the needs of the clinical decision support environment, including integration into a clinical information system architecture. Review of the design history and evolution of the Arden Syntax by workers who participated in this evolution from the perspective of the standards development organization (SDO). In order to meet user needs, a variety of features were successively incorporated in Arden Syntax. These can be grouped in several classes of change, including control flow, data structures, operators and external links. These changes included expansion of operators to manipulate lists and strings; a formalism for structured output; iteration constructs; user-defined objects and operators to manipulate them; features to support international use and output in different natural languages; additional control features; fuzzy logic formalisms; and mapping of the entire syntax to XML. The history and rationale of this evolution are summarized. In response to user demand and to reflect its growing role in clinical decision support, the Arden Syntax has evolved to include a number of powerful features. These depart somewhat from the original vision of the syntax as simple and easily understandable but from the SDO perspective increase the utility of this standard for implementation of CDS. Backwards compatibility has been maintained, allowing continued support of the earlier, simpler decision support models.",

During the last decade, enormous investment has gone into the information systems to manage human resources, but due to the lack of a clear vision, policy, and strategy, the results of these efforts have not been very visible. No reliable information portal captures the actual state of human resources in Pakistan's health sector. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided technical support for the assessment of the existing system and development of a comprehensive Human Resource Information System (HRIS) in Pakistan. The questions in the WHO-HRIS Assessment tool were distributed into five thematic groups. Purposively selected (n=65) representatives from the government, private sector, and development partners participated in this cross sectional study, based on their programmatic affiliations. Fifty-five percent of organizations and departments have an independent Human Resources (HR) section managed by an establishment branch and are fully equipped with functional computers. Forty-five organizations (70%) had HR rules, regulations and coordination mechanisms, yet these are not implemented. Data reporting is mainly in paper form, on prescribed forms (51%), registers (3%) or even plain papers (20%). Data analysis does not give inputs to the decision making process and dissemination of information is quite erratic. Most of the organizations had no feedback mechanism for cross checking the HR data, rendering it unreliable. Pakistan is lacking appropriate HRIS management. The current HRIS indeed has a multitude of problems. In the wake of 2011 reforms within the health sector, provinces are even in a greater need for planning their respective health department services and must work on the deficiencies and inefficiencies of their HRIS so that the gaps and HR needs are better aligned for reaching the 2015 UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets.",

    "abstract": "The Crimean peninsula, by virtue of its unique geographical conditions, has a variety of natural resources providing a basis for the maintenance of the health resort activities in the region. However, most local health centers suffer from the chronic and difficultly avoidable in the short term problems with logistical support, including the shortage of computers and the lack of modern network infrastructure. This circumstance limits the deployment capabilities of high-grade medical information systems for the automation of all components of the activity of health resorts and the significant improvement of the performance of other aspects of their work, such as efficient patient routing, workflow optimization, limiting the opportunities for the realization of certain corruption schemes by the staff. We have studied the routing of patients and the associated document flow in a number of Crimean spa and health resort facilities (sanatoriums). As a result, the basic work places at which information contained in the documents is undergoing changes were identified. Based on these data, the basic (modular) concept of the development of medical information system was formulated. According to the principle of modularity, the structure of the information system has been modified and optimized. The stages of implementation of this approach at various levels of logistic facilities were described, defined and justified. The key feature of the proposed system consists in that even the minimal equipment of computing infrastructure units (starting from a single workplace, such as a «medical receptionist») may be sufficient to achieve the significant degree of automation in the workflow, provide monitoring and analysis of the medical records of the spa and health resort facilities. By gradually increasing the number of related automated workplaces and modules, it is possible to expand the capabilities of the system up to the full automation of a given health resort facility.",

    "title": "The times they are a-changing: what worked and what we learned in deploying Ontario's Wait Time Information System.",
    "abstract": "How many days would you be comfortable waiting if you needed cancer surgery? What would you do if someone, not as medically urgent, was able to receive an MRI or CT scan before you? Would you want to know if you could wait less time for treatment at another location or with another clinician? These are some of the dilemmas facing patients and our health system when dealing with the issue of wait times. To address these pressing concerns, in the fall of 2004, Ontario launched its Wait Time Strategy. Two years later, Collins-Nakai et al. (2006) reported that Ontario had moved \"from being a laggard to a leader\" with respect to wait times. This article summarizes Ontario's work to date to improve access to care, including reviewing the need, action taken and the emerging results. Much can be learned and leveraged from the experiences described in this article and throughout this issue. They can serve as an important starting point for further discussion, improvement and action, for initiatives big and small, by all types of organizations and jurisdictions.",

Though isolated services at a patient's home might make sense for some applications, the full potential of home telehealth only arises through its integration into existing health information systems (HIS) and care processes. We know about traditional HIS architectures. However, so far no models exist, helping us to understand and describe the upcoming sensor-enhanced transinstitutional information system architectures for home telehealth services. To develop a nomenclature for sensor-enhanced transinstitutional health information system architectures. We conducted two systematic literature reviews, assessing typical services and users of home telehealth and key characteristics of transinstitutional health information system architectures. The information retrieved from both reviews was integrated to build the nomenclature sought after. We present a nomenclature of information and communication technology (ICT) architectures for home telehealth services. The developed dimensions provide an overview on typical users, services, operating organisations, information flow, geographical reach and architectural paradigms of sensor-enhanced transinstitutional health information systems. The developed nomenclature helps us to better understand the upcoming ICT architectures. However, we are still in need of further experiences with their application.",

The current study aims to compare the revenues declared in SIOPS by the municipalities and the National Health Fund records in order to assess the reliability of the two databases and identify which variables are most discordant. It also compares the data on Municipal expenditures with those from National Treasury records. The Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient (CCIC) was used for this analysis, complemented by a scatterplot of the mean values for the two databases and their differences. The 2002 data showed better quality. The recognition that SIOPS provides reliable data should stimulate new studies including financial aspects in the analysis of population health.",

Because our system actually corrects inaccurate operation information, it is different from most existing facilities for patient safety in that it reconstructs information independently from the HIS (Hospital Information System). We were permitted to send warning messages not only to the doctor who entered the orders, but also to the chief of medical staff and team members. For the warning method, we tried screen flashes and chimes, mobile phone messages, and high quality interactive voice responses. We also investigated the degree of message usefulness. Therein, by not relying on \"authenticity\" and \"readability,\" but by exhaustively collecting and appropriately revising in alignment with the use of information, we have created an original system that collects accurate information. This original system was established by medical staff members.

    "abstract": "Since 1993, a budding community health information network (CHIN) has been in operation in the Comox Valley in Canada. A general hospital and three multi-doctor clinics are linked electronically. The clinics operate without paper charts using a comprehensive clinic information system. The link is provided by RSALink, a commercial message exchange service, based on Health Link, a system developed at the University of Victoria (McDaniel et al., Can. Med. Inform. 1 (1994) 40-41; McDaniel, Dissertation, University of Victoria, Canada, 1994). Health Link is a highly adaptable message exchange service with rich functionality. Despite this, the system is used exclusively to receive laboratory results transmitted by the hospital's laboratory system (RSAStat). The results are deposited in the patient data base of a commercial clinic information system (CliniCare). This case is instructive because the users' selection of services available through Health Link allows us to observe the preferences in this informational sophisticated environment. Laboratory data transmission is appreciated as highly beneficial. The reliability, security and ample privacy protection and authentication features of Health Link, in contrast, are used in a black box mode and are not consciously exploited. This is consistent with our experience of the use of other systems which have operated for a substantial time, essentially without serious protection features. Our experience suggests that security and confidentiality features are exploited only to the extent that they do not require additional effort or conscientious intervention. This puts the system provider in the difficult position of either offering interactive systems that nobody will use, or providing automated features that nobody is aware of and that are therefore not used to full advantage--if at all.",

This immunization information system remained online via a backup system following the hurricane, thereby making immunization history data available to queries from healthcare providers caring for displaced persons both within Louisiana and throughout the United States. LINKS contained immunization records for approximately 1.5 million people of all ages at the time of the hurricane. Assessment of more than 21 000 successful electronic immunization queries of children and adolescents displaced outside Louisiana state boundaries from virtually all states estimates that more than $4.6 million was saved in revaccination expenses. The impact of recovered records for these children within Louisiana is certainly as critical.

Four patterns have been identified long term-high users, non long term-high users, long term-non high users, non long term-non high users. Data were provided by the regional Psychiatric Information System. The cohort of patients have been composed by 5,670 patients included in 1994 one year prevalence. Five Psychiatric Services (Merate, Treviglio, Crema, Desio, Castano Primo) with a total population of 610,184 inhabitants aged over 14. MAIN UTILISED MEASURES: Some sociodemographic and clinical variables have been taken into consideration for a descriptive analysis; a multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify the characteristics of patients associated with different patterns. Long term-high users were 5.3%, i.e. a mean rate of 4.9/10,000 residents over 14, and absorbed 60% of resources, the absence of a partner was associated in regression analysis with this pattern. Non long term-high users were 1.2%, i.e. a mean rate of 1.1/10,000 residents over 14, and absorbed 7.8% of resources; age below 45, unemployment, absence of a partner, severe mental illness and first contact with Psychiatric Services in the period 1985-1989 were predictive variables. Long term-non high users were 23.4%, i.e. a mean rate of 21.6/10,000 residents over 14, and absorbed 18.1% of resources; age below 45, unemployment, living alone, absence of a partner, severe mental illness and first contact with Psychiatric Services before 1990 were predictive variables. Non long term-non high users were 70.1%, i.e. a mean rate of 64.8/10,000 residents over 14 and, absorbed 18.1% of resources. Data show that on the whole the activity of Psychiatric Services is addressed to most serious patients, though considerable differences between Psychiatric Services utilisation may be found. This study highlights the importance of a regional Psychiatric Information System, that allows the monitoring in time and in the regional territory of patterns of care.",

    "abstract": "There is much criticism on the quality of criminal data available in Brazil, but there lacks systematic studies to corroborate it. Thus, it was conducted a comparison between homicides registered in Minas Gerais by two public information systems. The number of homicide deaths of the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health (SIM/MS) and Minas Gerais Military Police (PMMG), from 1979 to 1998, were assessed. The comparison between the two systems was performed using the ratio between absolute numbers, considering the municipalities categorized in five groups according to the population size in 1998, and homicide rates. Two linear regression models were adjusted for rates in time, one for each system. In cities with less than 100,000 inhabitants PMMG homicide data is more complete than SIM/MS one. In cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, SIM/MS registry is capable of providing homicide deaths data more efficiently, although it can include homicide deaths perpetrated in other municipalities and violent deaths of unknown nature that have not been due to homicide. The under-registration of PMMG in these municipalities can be due to late deaths in hospitals that are not followed up by PMMG. PMMG and SIM/MS systems represent the lower and upper limits of actual homicide deaths in larger cities. Both data sources should be analyzed and compared when both are available; when only one of them is available, the analysis should take into account the differences indicated in this study.",

Now and in the future, the task is even more complex because the principal issue is access to information itself, wherever it is located and in whatever form it may exist. The goal becomes more feasible because of changes in library practices achieved with technological innovation. Although individual elements of a campus-wide information system may already exist, the details for implementation are yet to be articulated.",

This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of data on underlying cause of death due to a specific neoplasm in the Municipality of Teresina, Piauí State, Brazil, based on all the death certificates from 2004 and 2005 that reported oral cancer as the underlying cause of death (total of 23 death certificates). The death certificates were recoded for underlying cause of death by using a form targeted at collecting clinical and laboratory data to confirm the medical diagnosis on patient charts. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination and clinical history. Simple agreement was 91.3%, kappa coefficient 0.84, and positive predictive value 90.9%. Based on the findings, the mortality statistics were valid and reliable. One limitation to this study was the possible underreporting of cases with oral cancer as the underlying cause of death, given that such data are not included in the mortality information system in Teresina.",

The absence of accepted standards and thus interoperability and the inadequate integration into transinstitutional health information systems (tHIS) are perceived as key factors. Based on the respective literature and previous experiences in home care projects we propose an architectural model for home care as part of a transinstitutional health information system using the HL7 clinical document architecture (CDA) as well as the HL7 Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems. In two short case studies we describe the practical realization of the architecture as well as first experiences. Our work can be regarded as a first step towards an interoperable - and in our view sustainable - home care architecture based on a prominent document standard from the health information system domain.",

This was an empirical study using Brazilian data for the state capitals and Federal District in 2002. For the two linkages separately applied in each capital, a three simple step blocking strategy was established, plus related multiple steps and also two clerical review strategies. From the total number of true pairs found after the two linkages, simple steps failed to find fewer than 8%, while the multiple step strategy failed to find only 0.7%. This approach allowed exploring the issue of severe maternal morbidity and mortality in these databases. The number of pairs found and reviewed under the multiple steps strategy was lower than the sum of pairs obtained with the three simple steps, and fewer pairs were lost. However, for the record linkage of the SIH with itself, both strategies are suggested.",

Within this hospital information system, on-line access to medical knowledge has been realised by installing a medical knowledge server in the range of about 24 GB and by providing access to it by health care professional workstations in wards, physicians' rooms, etc. During the study, we observed about 96 accesses per working day. The main group of health care professionals retrieving medical knowledge were physicians and medical students. Primary reasons for its utilisation were identified as support for the users' scientific work (50%), own clinical cases (19%), general medical problems (14%) and current clinical problems (13%). Health care professionals had accesses to medical knowledge bases such as MEDLINE (79%), drug bases ('Rote Liste', 6%), and to electronic text books and knowledge base systems as well. Sixty-five percent of accesses to medical knowledge were judged to be successful. In our opinion, medical knowledge retrieval can serve as a first step towards knowledge processing in medicine. We point out the consequences for the management of hospital information systems in order to provide the prerequisites for such a type of knowledge retrieval.",

A quantitative, analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using the years 2000 to 2005 as the reference. Invoices audited by the State Accounts Court were used as the parameter for determining reliability of the percentage of compliance with CA29 as reported to SIOPS, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to measure data agreement. The results show a mismatch between the databases, suggesting slight to moderate agreement between the SIOPS data and those from the State Accounts Court. The low degree of agreement may result from lack of consensus among municipalities regarding definition of health-related revenues and expenses or the existence of different criteria used by SIOPS and the State Accounts Court for calculating the CA29.",

System evolution and change management are viewed as two sides of the same coin, thus formal methods for process analysis and IT system evolution were embedded into a goal-oriented change management model. Based on a process model, a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a computer simulation were performed. A tool for rapid application development (RAD) was used to incrementally improve the healthcare information system according to newly arising needs. Each of the formal methods used contributed to the successful reorganization of the interdisciplinary clinical process. An evaluation demonstrated significant improvements. An integrated IT application was implemented to support the optimized process. Process improvement is feasible and effective when formal methods for process analysis and requirements specification are used in a reasonable and goal-oriented way. It might be necessary to trade off costs and benefits or simplify a given method in the context of a particular project. As the same information is utilized in different tools, it is supposed that the efforts for process analysis, documentation and implementation of adapted applications could be reduced if different tools were integrated and based on a single coherent reference model for description of clinical processes.",

Personal experience with the difficulty of establishing a suitable information system has led to the development of a methodology for endusers to develop their own applications with only the guidance of information technology professionals (ITPs)--here entitled 'Small Unit Enduser Rapid Application Development' or SERAD. A data base management system (DBMS) is used to manage data about 'focal objects' with status flags and queries/views at interface points through UDA (UserAction, DataEntry, ApplicationAction) cycles. The system which permits data entry almost immediately, not only eventually creates a full application, but also trains endusers in the process. The methodology leads ITPs and ensuers through a sequence of exercises in systems analysis, tailored to minimise the time and effort input of ITPs despite the relative lack of IT training and concepts in endusers, with a view to rapidly creating dynamic, robust and sound information systems.",

    "abstract": "A baseline assessment of the structure, dynamics, and monitoring capabilities of the information systems for road traffic injuries was conducted in three Peruvian cities: Lima, Huamanga and Pucallpa. 50 in-depth interviews were performed with key stakeholders, including managers and operators of information systems. The instrument was developed taking into account international standards and recommendations for information systems. Six information systems were identified, some of which contain integrated operational systems enabling the recollection, processing, aggregation and data analysis following automated processes. These systems are considered valuable by different stakeholders because of their ability to present data in an organized manner. A low level of collaboration and exchange of information between institutions in the diverse aspects of data collection, processing and usage was observed. Officially, formal collaboration agreements between institutions do exist, potentially enabling more collaborative work. An interest was expressed in establishing an integrated information system due to the need for detailed and solid/trusted information that maximizes the use of existing resources. Current information systems for road traffic injuries have limitations. The actual use and utility of the information for decision-making for prevention of road traffic injuries nationwide is limited.",

Existing, antiquated \"legacy\" computer systems often fail to meet these requirements, due to high cost, slow turnaround, inconsistent data definitions, duplication, inflexibility and the lack of data integrity. There are five major transitions that an organization's information system undergoes to realize the full potential of new technology: from monolithic to parallel architectures; from procedural to object-oriented programming; from structural to relational databases; from legacy to \"leap-frog\" systems; and from fragmented systems to multimedia.",

    "abstract": "Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) makes an efficient and convenient connection between patient(s)/user(s) at home and doctor(s) at a clinical center. To ensure secure connection between the two entities (patient(s)/user(s), doctor(s)), user authentication is enormously important for the medical server. In this regard, many authentication protocols have been proposed in the literature only for accessing single medical server. In order to fix the drawbacks of the single medical server, we have primarily developed a novel architecture for accessing several medical services of the multi-medical server, where a user can directly communicate with the doctor of the medical server securely. Thereafter, we have developed a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for TMIS system using cryptographic one-way hash function. We have analyzed the security of our proposed authentication scheme through both formal and informal security analysis. Furthermore, we have simulated the proposed scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool and showed that the scheme is secure against the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal security analysis is also presented which confirms that the protocol has well security protection on the relevant security attacks. The security and performance comparison analysis confirm that the proposed protocol not only provides security protection on the above mentioned attacks, but it also achieves better complexities along with efficient login and password change phase.",

Different standards contribute to ease this integration. In a research project focussing on the development of a reference architecture for inter-institutional health information systems, we identified and categorised concurring integration standards by distinguishing between technical and semantic integration on the one hand, and data and functional integration on the other hand. In addition, standards for semantic integration are roughly categorised according to their scope. By placing standards into a corresponding matrix a \"semantic gap\" is revealed, which cannot be covered by standards as it contains volatile medical concepts. As a conclusion, it is recommended to conceptually consider the necessity of system evolution in systems architectures and also in future integration standards.",

Health care providers will become part of larger health care organizations, such as accountable health plans (AHPs), to provide health care services under a managed care or contracted fee-for-service basis. Information systems that were designed under the old health care model will no longer be applicable to the new health care reform system. The new information systems will have to be patient-centered, operate under a managed care environment, and function to handle patients throughout the continuum of care across a multiple-provider organization. The new information system will require extensive network infrastructures operating at high speeds, integration of LANs and WANs across large geographic areas, sophisticated interfacing tools, consolidation of core patient data bases, and consolidation of the supporting IS infrastructure (applications, data centers, staff, etc.). The changes associated with the health care reform initiatives may, indeed, turn current information systems upside down.",

    "title": "User-defined functions in the Arden Syntax: An extension proposal.",
    "abstract": "The Arden Syntax is a knowledge-encoding standard, started in 1989, and now in its 10th revision, maintained by the health level seven (HL7) organization. It has constructs borrowed from several language concepts that were available at that time (mainly the HELP hospital information system and the Regenstrief medical record system (RMRS), but also the Pascal language, functional languages and the data structure of frames, used in artificial intelligence). The syntax has a rationale for its constructs, and has restrictions that follow this rationale. The main goal of the Standard is to promote knowledge sharing, by avoiding the complexity of traditional programs, so that a medical logic module (MLM) written in the Arden Syntax can remain shareable and understandable across institutions. One of the restrictions of the syntax is that you cannot define your own functions and subroutines inside an MLM. An MLM can, however, call another MLM, where this MLM will serve as a function. This will add an additional dependency between MLMs, a known criticism of the Arden Syntax knowledge model. This article explains why we believe the Arden Syntax would benefit from a construct for user-defined functions, discusses the need, the benefits and the limitations of such a construct. We used the recent grammar of the Arden Syntax v.2.10, and both the Arden Syntax standard document and the Arden Syntax Rationale article as guidelines. We gradually introduced production rules to the grammar. We used the CUP parsing tool to verify that no ambiguities were detected. A new grammar was produced, that supports user-defined functions. 22 production rules were added to the grammar. A parser was built using the CUP parsing tool. A few examples are given to illustrate the concepts. All examples were parsed correctly. It is possible to add user-defined functions to the Arden Syntax in a way that remains coherent with the standard. We believe that this enhances the readability and the robustness of MLMs. A detailed proposal will be submitted by the end of the year to the HL7 workgroup on Arden Syntax.",

We studied the emergency medical information systems to analyse their present status, clarify their purpose, and present the ideal system, in view of community health care requirements. Here the results of the research are examined, and there is a discussion of what is needed to improve the system in the future. The emergency medical information system in Aichi prefecture is taken as an example, to closely survey its present situation and analyse the evaluation of the system by the residents who are the major beneficiaries of the system.",

Authentication and key agreement is essential to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability for TMIS. Most recently, Chen et al. proposed an efficient and secure dynamic ID-based authentication scheme for TMIS, and claimed that their scheme achieves user anonymity. However, we observe that Chen et al.'s scheme achieves neither anonymity nor untraceability, and is subject to the identity guessing attack and tracking attack. In order to protect user privacy, we propose an enhanced authentication scheme which achieves user anonymity and untraceablity. It is a secure and efficient authentication scheme with user privacy preservation which is practical for TMIS.",

A random sample of 411 death certificates due to violence was obtained in Belo Horizonte, Southeastern Brazil, between 1998 and 2000. Based on data from death certificates and Forensic Medicine Institute database, causes of death were coded and the agreement between this information and that from Mortality Information System was assessed. Also, in all certificates including \"non-specified injury\" and \"undetermined death events,\" the impact of adding information from Forensic Medicine Institute was assessed in the classification of cause of death. Coding agreement was significant (Kappa=0.782; 95% CI: 0.744; 0.819) and of the underlying cause was moderate to significant (Kappa=0.602; 95% CI: 0.563; 0.641). There were 12.9% and 5.7% misclassification of suicides and murders, respectively, for those causes classified as \"non-specified injury\" and \"undetermined death events,\" which were overall reduced to 47.3% and 59.8% respectively. There is a need for further improving the process of underlying cause coding and selection. Also medical examiners need to provide more complete death certificates and medical and police information provided with bodies for Forensic Medicine Institute autopsy should be more complete, especially in those cases of road traffic injuries and falls.",

The call encounters were video recorded and the phone calls were audio recorded. The screens were also recorded to capture the HIS navigation. After the call was completed, the recordings were played back for the telenurse and discussion ensued regarding any issues with the system; this encounter was also recorded for further analysis. Several factors were identified that influenced how telenurses made decisions while using the CDSS. It was found that the decision ladder model could be applied to describe telenurse strategies while using CDSS. The purpose of this paper is to describe the emerging factors that influence telenurses' decision making during a clinical simulation study in a telenursing call centre.",

Lastly, the author emphasizes the strategic value of combining efforts with national statistics bureaus in this endeavour. The information system will thus be able to provide a short-term and long-term vision, and not only a static view of the situation at any given time.",

Next, the methodological design of an information system to support efficient and sustainable transportation planning and management aiming to integrate inputs from several different data sources is presented. The resulting framework deploys modular and integrated databases which include data stemming from different national or regional data banks and which integrate information belonging to different transportation fields. For this reason, it allows public administrations to account for many strategic elements that influence their decisions regarding transportation, both from a systemic and infrastructural point of view.",

This article describes how a nursing process model was derived from Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory, the process model validated, and data relationships established within the model prior to its use as a structure for a CNIS.",

The Information Analysis Center, which was prominently recommended in SGI, has not become a central element of the information system. Instead automation, which was only beginning in 1963, has become dominant. Though extreme automation may be appropriate for those activities that are time constrained, it may lead to clogged information channels for those scientific activities for which time is less important than depth of understanding.",

This article is based on data from the Information System on Live Births (SINASC), implemented in 1990 and expanded gradually to cover 90% of all births in the country. Preterm birth time trends are presented for Brazil, regions, and capitals from 1994 to 2005. At the national level, there was an increase in the preterm birth rate, accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of missing information on gestational age. The Southeast, South, and Central-West regions followed the national trend, while the preterm birth rate fell in the North and Northeast regions. We compared the findings from SINASC with those from population-based studies. The coverage and quality of SINASC has increased over time, but problems with the determination of gestational age still remain, leading to underestimation of preterm birth rates. Due to the importance of SINASC for monitoring, further efforts are needed to improve the system's accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to build a theoretical framework for analysis of when decision-makers should use end-user participation as a form of insurance for unforeseen consequences of implementing information systems in healthcare organizations. Data were collected in a case study of an information system development project in a small clinical setting. During the initial phase, the future end-users of the system were allowed to actively influence the system design and test every new tool that was considered for implementation. The results of the case study suggest that when time and effort are invested in allowing healthcare staff to participate in information system development processes, the benefits can well exceed the costs throughout the life cycle of the project. Risk-averse decision-makers fearing negative secondary consequences of a HIS, with regard to clinical work flow, will always adopt measures to prevent future failures, if they can find a possibility of shifting these risks. Therefore, they calculate the present discounted value of the effects accrued over time to the unit and predict the amount of resources they are willing to pay to acquire on insurance (such as design participation) that will protect the organization from future losses. End-user participation in the design process can be the key positive influence on the quality of the service and, thereby, organizational effectiveness. Investments in broad design participation can, consequently, be a productive activity that transforms potential current income into future benefits.",

In addition, the effusion of epidemics even in developed countries makes the need for the enhancement of public health services imperative. In order to best confront the above-described challenges, the National Technical University of Athens, in cooperation with the Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare and the European Commission (EC), designed and developed an integrated public health information network, named GEPIMI (Integrated Geographical System for EPIdemiological and other Medical Information), in the framework of a three-year pilot project. This pilot project, funded by Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare and the EC supported the Programme INTERREG II to establish an advanced and integrated web-based information system that can process and move information in real time, allowing public health authorities to monitor events at hundreds or thousands of public health facilities at once. The system is established among hospitals, primary healthcare authorities and health agents in Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Fyrom, and Turkey. The project aims at demonstrating the best practices, prospects, applications and high potential of Telematics Healthcare Networks in Europe, with a view to promoting cooperation and interconnection between European communities in the field of Telematics Healthcare Applications. The GEPIMI System, implemented via an innovative web based system, constitutes a replication of a highly effective mechanism. It incorporates state-of-the-art technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (G.I.S.), web based databases, GPS, and Smart Card Technology and supports a variety of health-related web applications including early warning and response of epidemics, remote management of medical records, seamless healthcare coverage, comprehensive statistical analysis of data, decision-making procedures, inter-communication between international scientific fora and other.",

    "title": "[Setting up a national information system for prevention].",
    "abstract": "The recent law (D.lgs n. 81/2008) redesigned all the Italian regulations regarding safety and health at work. It redesigned rules that up to now were contained in laws that were introduce over a period of over nearly sixty years, with due review and extension. Article 8 of the law is dedicated specifically to a national information system for the prevention at the workplace (called SINP), created \"with the aim of supplying useful data in order to guide, programme, to plan, and assess the effectiveness of actions taken for the prevention of injuries and occupational diseases... and to provide guidance in matters of inspection\". It is important to emphasize that the course followed to define the SINP is due to the joint efforts that INAIL, ISPESL, the Regions and the independent Provinces started in 2002, by agreeing to a protocol, with the common aim of creating an integrated information system for prevention in the workplace. At present data are available on a national scale and they are useful in order to acquire more detailed knowledge of the area in question (on enterprises, accidents, occupational diseases) and in order to define intervention priorities, to plan and program activities and verify the results.",

    "title": "Changes in health care: challenges for information system design.",
    "abstract": "It is widely recognized that the systematic availability of medical care services is a vital component of the social network. Although particular political, cultural and economic factors lead to different strategic approaches in different countries, all are faced with balancing resource allocation against the perceived desirability of the results. In many countries the social urgency to address this issue has reached a critical status. All of the current changes and challenges in health care delivery are to a large extent being driven by these considerations. Information systems consisting of telecommunication and computing technologies will play a key role in supporting emerging delivery systems. The purpose of this brief paper is to identify the major themes within this complex network of considerations and to serve perhaps as a road map in on-going system design and evaluation efforts.",

In other hand, health information system of The Federation of BiH must be an object of both reform and reconstruction. This thesis points out that reform of health information system is a crucial priorities in order to improve and fasten reform. There is a paradigmatic question: who provides service, to whom, what is the price, and what is the final solution? In order to answer this question, an integral health information system that will be computer supported is necessary. For integral work and information exchange, computers must be connected and follow the same operating procedures. Benefits of an integral health information system, as well as impact factors for its implementation are discussed in the paper.",

The UML will accelerate advanced uses of object-orientation such as reuse technology, resulting in significantly higher software productivity. The UML is also applicable in the context of a component paradigm that promises to enhance the capabilities of healthcare information systems and simplify their management and maintenance.",

Local authorities believe that their information is good enough already, and have little confidence in statistics prepared by the central authorities. On the other hand many of them called for more statistics that would enable comparisons between neighbouring municipalities, and several had themselves taken the initiative to collect data on various local needs and activities.",

    "abstract": "In Ghana, between January 1990 and September 1993, a series of steps were undertaken to review the existing vertical reporting procedures and to develop an integrated Health Management Information System (HMIS) for Primary Health Care (PHC). These steps included a situation analysis of the existing reporting systems; participatory design of tools for planning, data collection, feedback and reporting; field test and revision of the modified system; training of staff at all levels; development of tools for self-assessment and stimulation of routine feedback to lower levels and reporting of analysed indicators to higher levels. There were some notable achievements which included promotion of self-reliance, improved data relevance and accuracy, as well as strengthened supervision and support. However, it was difficult to identify the most appropriate institutional location for the HMIS; over-emphasis on process leads to reduced implementation; reporting was still given greater priority than analysis and use of data, and systems for collection and use were still cumbersome and time consuming. It is also difficult to prove that having better information really improves decision-making, or even coverage and quality of PHC service delivery. These issues, as well as lessons learned, are discussed in the paper.",

    "title": "Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?",
    "abstract": "Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs. The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.",

Therefore, I suggest building of a cheaper variant of the information system which could be upgrated, and which will involve, on this stage, small number of health workers. Computerized part of this information system would be built in several levels. At each of these levels data for the needs of health statistics, economic-financial activities, and management would be processed. Communication within information system, on this stage, would be enabled through telephone lines and modems. The system would work \"off line\".

The HIP ICIS allows anyone with a Touch-Tone telephone, fax machine, or computer to access CDC information that answers the most commonly asked questions from infection control practitioners and other health care workers. The HIP ICIS has received approximately 56,608 inquiries; of these, 33% were about CDC guidelines on prevention and control of nosocomial infections, 25% about issues related to HIV, 16% about sterilization and disinfection of medical devices, 8% about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3% about long-term care facilities, and 17% miscellaneous topics (e.g., nosocomial infection rates, infection control courses, and ventilation, construction, and renovation of hospitals). The HIP ICIS is an efficient method of providing infection control guidance to the infection control community.

A significant feature is the support of intra- and interdepartmental clinical processes by means of providing document flow between different user groups. For flexible storage of newly developed applications, a generic EAV-type (Entity-Attribute-Value) database schema is used. Important aspects of a consequent implementation, like database representation of structured documents, document flow, versioning, and synchronization are presented.

STRUCTURE AND METHODS: European network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) connected sixty-four HTA Partner organizations from thirty-three countries. User needs in the different steps of the HTA process were the starting point for developing an information system. A step-wise, interdisciplinary, creative approach was used in developing practical tools. An Information Platform facilitated the exchange of scientific information between Partners and with external target groups. More than 200 virtual meetings were set up during the project using an e-meeting tool. A Clearinghouse prototype was developed with the intent to offering a single point of access to HTA relevant information. This evolved into a next step not planned from the outset: Developing a running HTA Information System including several Web-based tools to support communication and daily HTA processes. A communication strategy guided the communication effort, focusing on practical tools, creating added value, involving stakeholders, and avoiding duplication of effort. Modern technology enables a new information infrastructure for HTA. The potential of information and communication technology was used as a strategic tool. Several target groups were represented among the Partners, which supported collaboration and made it easier to identify user needs. A distinctive visual identity made it easier to gain and maintain visibility on a limited budget.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to push further our understanding of physicians' acceptance of clinical information systems, we propose a relatively new construct, namely, psychological ownership. We situated the construct within a nomological net using a prevailing and dominant information technology adoption behavior model as a logical starting point. A mail survey was sent to the population of users of a regional physician order entry (POE) system aimed at speeding up the transmission of clinical data, mainly laboratory tests and radiology examinations, within a community health network. All scales, but one, were measured using previously validated instruments. For its part, the psychological ownership scale was developed using a multistage iterative procedure. Ninety-one questionnaires were returned to the researchers, for a response rate of 72.8%. Our findings reveal that, in order to foster physicians' adoption of a clinical information system, it is important to encourage and cultivate a positive attitude toward using the new system. In this connection, positive perception of the technology's usefulness is crucial. Second, results demonstrate that psychological ownership of a POE system is positively associated with physicians' perceptions of system utility and system user friendliness. Last, through their active involvement and participation, physicians feel they have greater influence on the development process, thereby developing feelings of ownership toward the clinical system. Psychological ownership's highly significant associations with user participation and crucial beliefs driving technology acceptance behaviors among physicians affirm the value of this construct in extending our understanding of POE adoption.",

SVHMC prepared the MIS users through an extensive and well-documented training program focused on user competence and user acceptance. Over five and one-half years, 4581 individuals received 9,359 hours of training. Direct training costs were $116,000; total training costs were $317,000.

ClinRefLink is somewhat unique in that it offers clinicians the option to perform reference searches based on clinical entities identified within narrative documents. In the first 30 days after implementation, 1018 reference searches were performed. The characteristics of the clinicians and the clinical context of the search terms are described. These data support the value of clinical term extraction from narrative documents as a component of an infobutton system.",

The Ministry selected in the Spring 2001 three regions more in Finland to develop their services within the experimental Act. These four regions are approximately 50% out of the population in Finland.",

This represents a new strategic approach that will require different information systems, which should incorporate the rapid advances made in the field of information technology and communication. The aim of this article was to identify the most important aspects to be taken into account in information systems in public health from a technological perspective, both in their development and in the elements that compose them. To overcome the fragmentation of information systems in public health, these systems must be successfully integrated among themselves and with other health and non-health systems. To achieve this task, technical, semantic and organizational interoperability must be ensured. Emerging technologies should be considered to support these new strategies, especially Web 2.0 tools. This new strategic development will pose additional challenges because of its size and the diversity of the departments involved. It is proposed that information systems will include the elements of Web 2.0 and support systems for decision-making technologies in addition to the traditional operational systems.",

There are insufficient practices in existing EA evaluation models in terms of considering all EA functions and processes, using structured methods in developing EA implementation, employing matured practices, and using appropriate metrics to achieve proper evaluation. The aim of this research is to develop a hybrid evaluation method that supports achieving the objectives of EA implementation. To attain this aim, the first step is to identify EA implementation evaluation practices. To this end, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. Second, the proposed hybrid method was developed based on the foundation and information extracted from the SLR, semi-structured interviews with EA practitioners, program theory evaluation and Information Systems (ISs) evaluation. Finally, the proposed method was validated by means of a case study and expert reviews. This research provides a suitable foundation for researchers who wish to extend and continue this research topic with further analysis and exploration, and for practitioners who would like to employ an effective and lightweight evaluation method for EA projects.",

In order to sustain our health information systems and with it our health systems, we need to focus on defining and maintaining sustainable Health Information System building blocks or components. These components need to be easily updatable when clinical knowledge (or anything else) changes, easily adaptable when business requirements or processes change, and easily exchangeable when technology advances. One major prerequisite for this is that we need to be able to define and measure sustainability, so that it can become one of the major business drivers in HIS development. Therefore, this paper analyses general definitions and indicators for sustainability, and analyses their applicability to HIS. We find that general 'Emergy analysis' is one possibility to measure sustainability for HIS. Based on this, we investigate major enablers and inhibitors to sustainability in a highlevel framework consisting of four pillars: clinical, technical, socio-technical, and political/business.",

In this paper, we analyze Mishra et al.'s scheme and identify that their scheme is insecure to against known session key attack and impersonation attack. Thereby, we present a modified biometrics-based authentication scheme for TMIS to eliminate the aforementioned faults. Besides, we demonstrate the completeness of the proposed scheme through BAN-logic. Compared to the related schemes, our protocol can provide stronger security and it is more practical.",

Patients with headache were tested both to validate the system and to evaluate patient satisfaction and headache management with an automated system. The mean age of all study participants was 44 years. Over 95% of the participants were satisfied or strongly satisfied with the Automated Medical Information System. The results strongly suggest that patients are willing and able to use nontraditional sources, such as the Automated Medical Information System, to learn about their illnesses.",

Such a health information system should provide the information support for the planning process, monitoring and health evaluation, health care and work in public-health services sector. The experiences in the work of information system organization in Tuzla Canton Public Health Institute should be seen from two aspects: Aspect of the information system significance in the framework of the social-medical, epidemiological, hygiene-ecological and other activities of the Institute; Aspect of the information system development within the Public Health facilities of Canton in relation to the automatic data processing important for registration, tracking and recognition of success and population health care needs. From the aspect of establishing the information system in the area of Tuzla Canton and the Public Health Institute role, there is a need for adequate high technology technical equipment, with the task to enable practical realization of defined projects and in such a way, varied acceleration of work giving as a result usable information. The canton Public Health Institute needs as follows: necessary resources for free information system work; to provide free computer access to all; to ensure connection with other PHI through communications. In this way the canton Public Health Institute information system would be connected with other information systems in the field of health. In would be a base for development of integrated health information system. The information system is desirable aim for the work of Public Health Institute, method of selection and leading content of modernization. Analysing the Bill of Law on Health Care, a defectiveness has been noticed, since the information system is not regulated. Therefore, the need to be issued by Lay is of great importance. A statement that all projects on local information systems, started before war or during the war have been stooped, joins to the aforesaid, and also a series of independent information system in different health segments, which are not connected into one, unique information system.

Previous work-measurement systems used by hospital pharmacies have been too time consuming or imprecise for widespread use. A national hospital pharmacy work-measurement system known as HPMIS was developed to provide comprehensive and widely applicable information on pharmacy expenses, personnel use, and productivity. HPMIS converts data from participating hospitals into 17 indicators that enhance the comparability of the information between the hospitals. The 17 indicators relate to pharmacy production, clinical services, and administrative functions; also included are several gross department indicators that combine elements of all three areas. After analysis and categorization of the data according to characteristics such as bed size, geographical location, and type of drug-distribution system, results are reported to individual hospitals. A national work-measurement system such as HPMIS should enable hospitals to evaluate their pharmacy operations in relation to those of other hospitals and to track their department's relative management performance over time.",

    "abstract": "To analyze underreporting of deaths and hospital admissions from tuberculosis to the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). Cases with tuberculosis as basic or associated cause of death were selected from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) and hospital admissions for tuberculosis as main or secondary cause from the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SIH-SUS), for residents in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 2004. Probabilistic record linkage was carried out between the SIM and SIH-SUS databases and the SINAN for the years 2002 to 2004. Out of the 542 deaths from tuberculosis in the period, 234 (43.2%) were not registered in the SINAN for the two previous years. As for the 1,079 admissions, 238 (22.1%) failed to be notified. Seventy-one deaths were related to these admissions: 47 were registered out of the SIH-SUS by death, 24 occurred after discharge and seven remained unnotified in the SINAN. The elderly were 1.6 times (95%CI 1.074;2.516) less likely to be notified than younger patients, and those with at least a college education were 3.6 times (95%CI 1.384;11.022) less likely to be notified than those with no formal education. Patients under 15 were 4.8 times (95%CI 2.757;8.452) less likely to be notified than those aged between 15 and 59 years. Some regional health administration divisions showed a percentage of unnotified deaths of over 50% and this percentage ranged from 37.8% to 12.7% for hospital admissions. The data suggest problems in the detection of cases and point to obstacles in adequate and timely treatment, as well as to quality flaws in the information system, with differences among regions in the municipality.",

An automated system has been programmed to compile and retrieve data concerning stored units, prepare shipping documents as required, and maintain transfusion records in a retrievable manner for thawed or shipped units. Requests for frozen red blood cells are processed through this system. Units are selected by the computer to meet requirements specified by the operator of a keyboard terminal. These requirements include method of cryopreservation, specific antigenic characteristics required, and the number of units requested. The computer prints out on the keyboard terminal the units meeting the requirements and the keyboard operator then indicates to the computer the name of the requesting facility, if these units are to be shipped. This input initiates a programmed routine that generates a shipping invoice and a new file for these units in a permanent transfusion record which can by acessed by either donor number or the frozen blood cell code.",

Selected literature (76 studies) is classified according to the type of automated information system (based on relationship to the care process), the study design used, the data collection methods used, the effect(s) measured and the type of evaluation (e.g. cost-benefit analysis). First results show that certain types of automated information systems have not been evaluated much, going by the number of studies selected. Furthermore, it is observed that certain study designs (time-series design), data collection methods (modelling and simulation) and effect measures (job satisfaction) are hardly to be found in the literature. Only 10 of 76 selected studies used a type of evaluation for which both consequences and costs are considered. Detailed investigation of the literature may provide information for the development of a general framework for the evaluation of different types of automated information systems.",

The Government then tried to keep the SCAN information accessible by offering it to the private sector. The Government solicited applicants through both the Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily. As a result, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and AoA signed an agreement calling for AARP to make such of the SCAN information accessible on-line and to update it.",

A household listing was carried out in 221 enumeration areas in food insecure areas of Ethiopia to determine the presence of a child less than 24-months. This list of children was then compared against the information stored at the local health posts. A household survey was administered to a sample of 2155 households that had a child less than 24-months of age to assess determinants and consequences of exclusion from the health post registers. Out of the 10,318 children identified during the listing, 36% were found from the health post records. Further analysis based on the household survey data indicated that health posts that had adopted nationally recommended recordkeeping practices had more complete records (p < 0.01) and that children residing farther from health posts were less likely to be found from the registers (p < 0.05). Mothers whose child was found from the registers were more likely to know a health extension worker (p < 0.01), had a contact with one (p < 0.01), and their child was more likely to have received growth monitoring (p < 0.05). The incompleteness of the data collected at the health posts poses a challenge for effective implementation of the national health extension program and various complementary programs in Ethiopia.",

Bibliographic retrieval is the third most frequent reason for use, but is an order of magnitude less frequent than either results inquiry or electronic mail. Secondary retrieval of aggregate data from a clinical database is two orders of magnitude less common than primary retrieval. In a study at our hospital, clinicians gained access to an information resource during 16% of all general medical visits of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection while the patient was present. Insofar as our narrow focus on the primary care of HIV infection models the larger context of clinical medicine, clinicians are most often looking at information relating to therapeutics. Whatever knowledge structures are adopted, they must accommodate this observed need for therapeutic information.",

We identify a variety of meanings ranging from the purely technical integration of information systems to the integration of services. This ambiguity (or interpretive flexibility), we argue, is inherent rather than accidental: it is a necessary prerequisite for mobilizing political and ideological support among stakeholders for integrated health information systems. Building on this, our aim is to trace out the career dynamics of the vision of 'integration/ integrated'. The career dynamics is the transformation of both the imaginary and the material (technological) realizations of the unfolding implementation of the vision of integrated care. Empirically we draw on a large, ongoing project at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) to establish an integrated health information system.",

This methodology is implemented in DBE, an information system that supports the analysis and visualisation of experimental data in the context of metabolic networks. It consists of five parts: (1) the DBE-Database for consistent data storage, (2) the Excel-Importer application for the data import, (3) the DBE-Website as the interface for the system, (4) the DBE-Pictures application for the up- and download of binary (e. g. image) files, and (5) DBE-Gravisto, a network analysis and graph visualisation system.

A cross-sectional analysis of the reliability and completeness of Sinasc's data was performed using a sample of Live Birth Certificate (LBC) from 2009, related to births from Campinas, Southeast Brazil. For data analysis, hospitals were grouped according to category of service (Unified National Health System, private or both), 600 LBCs were randomly selected and the data were collected in LBC-copies through mothers and newborns' hospital records and by telephone interviews. The completeness of LBCs was evaluated, calculating the percentage of blank fields, and the LBCs agreement comparing the originals with the copies was evaluated by Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients. The percentage of completeness of LBCs ranged from 99.8%-100%. For the most items, the agreement was excellent. However, the agreement was acceptable for marital status, maternal education and newborn infants' race/color, low for prenatal visits and presence of birth defects, and very low for the number of deceased children. The results showed that the municipality Sinasc is reliable for most of the studied variables. Investments in training of the professionals are suggested in an attempt to improve system capacity to support planning and implementation of health activities for the benefit of maternal and child population.",

In the Philippines, after the devolution of health care to local governments, we observed \"health information system islands\" connected to national vertical programs being implemented in devolved health units. These structures lead to a huge amount of \"information work\" in the transformation of health information at the community level. This paper describes work done to develop and implement the open-source Community Based Health Information Tracking System (CHITS) Project, which was implemented to address this information management problem and its outcomes. Several lessons learned from the field as well as software development strategies are highlighted in building community level information systems that link to national level health information systems.",

Servers located in the 'middle' tier apply the clinical (business) model and application rules to communicate with so-called 'thin client' workstations. The main characteristics are the focus on modelling and reuse of both data and business logic as there is a shift away from data and functional modelling towards object modelling. Scalability as well as adaptability to constantly changing requirements via component driven computing are the main reasons for that approach.",

There are undoubtedly health care institutions with management information systems (MISs) that are of dubious value, just as there are institutions in which the MIS is of enormous value. The question of the value of an MIS to an institution has more to do with an understanding of what an MIS is, what the institution's information needs are, and what the MIS can and should be doing for an organization, than it does with any inherent benefits that the system displays in and of itself exclusive of its environment. The views that follow address the process of evaluation that should take place to assess these issues and maximize the effectiveness of an information system in an organization.

That database was compared to a new database comprised of cryptococcal meningitis cases from this System, from the Assessoria de Meningite da Secretaria de Saúde do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (State Department of Health Meningitis Advisory Committee), and from the Instituto Estadual de Infectologia São Sebastião (State Institute of Infectious Diseases) laboratory records. The System detected 65.7% of the cases present in the new database. The percentage of patients with AIDS as a pre-existing disease was similar in both databases (26% and 24.9%). Thus, even though cryptococcal meningitis incidence is underreported in the System, the profile of notified cases reflects the profile of the total number of cases.",

The systems fulfilling this architecture will be able to store electronic health records of the patients using OWL ontologies, share patient records among different hospitals and provide physicians expertise to assist them in making decisions. The system is intelligent because it is rule-based, makes use of rule-based reasoning and has the ability to learn and evolve itself. The learning capability is provided by extracting rules from previously given decisions by the physicians and then adding the extracted rules to the system. The proposed system is novel and original in all of these aspects. As a case study, a system is implemented conforming to SAMS architecture for use by dentists in the dental domain. The use of the developed system is described with a scenario. For evaluation, the developed dental information system will be used and tried by a group of dentists. The development of this system proves the applicability of SAMS architecture. By getting decision support from a system derived from this architecture, the cognitive gap between experienced and inexperienced physicians can be compensated. Thus, patient satisfaction can be achieved, inexperienced physicians are supported in decision making and the personnel can improve their knowledge. A physician can diagnose a case, which he/she has never diagnosed before, using this system. With the help of this system, it will be possible to store general domain knowledge in this system and the personnel's need to medical guideline documents will be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Nursing workforce shortage has emerged as a global problem. Foreign nurse importation is a popular strategy to address the shortage. The interactions between nursing staff on either side of the Taiwan Strait continue to increase. Since both nurses in Taiwan and nurses in China have adopted nursing information systems to improve health care processes and quality, it is necessary to investigate factors influencing nursing information system usage in nursing practice. This study examined the effects of cultural and other related factors on nurses' intentions to use nursing information systems. The findings were expected to serve as an empirical base for further benchmarking and management of cross-strait nurses. This survey was conducted in two case hospitals (one in Taiwan and one in China). A total of 880 questionnaires were distributed (n=440 in each hospital). The results showed effort expectancy had a significant effect on the intention to use nursing information systems of nurses in China (P=.003) but not nurses in Taiwan (P=.16). Findings suggest nursing managers should adopt different strategies to motivate cross-strait nurses to use nursing information systems. Promoting effort expectancy is more likely to motivate nurses in China than in Taiwan. This discrepancy is probably due to the less hierarchical and more feminine society in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Modelling and simulation of information systems by the means of miniatures on computer aim at two general objectives: (a) as an aid to design and realization of information systems; and (b) a tool to improve the dialogue between the designer and the users. An operational information system has two components bound by a dynamic relationship, an information system and a behavioural system. Thanks to the behaviour system, modelling and simulation allow the designer to integrate into the projects a large proportion of the system's implicit specification. The advantages of modelling to the information system relate to: (a) The conceptual phase: initial objectives are compared with the results of simulation and sometimes modified. (b) The external specifications: simulation is particularly useful for personalising man-machine relationships in each application. (c) The internal specifications: if the miniatures are built on the concept of process, the global design and the software are tested and also the simulation refines the configuration and directs the choice of hardware. (d) The implementation: stimulation reduces costs, time and allows testing. Progress in modelling techniques will undoubtedly lead to better information systems.",

The article assesses the system's potential for monitoring inequalities in infant mortality in various States in the country. Accessibility, timeliness, methodological clarity, incompleteness, and consistency were explored as quality indicators. Selected variables were: race, birth weight, gestational age, medical care, parity, and maternal schooling, age, and occupation. The study also reviewed the system's working documentation and the scientific literature on infant mortality. Proportions of data incompleteness were calculated by region and State, identifying factors that might influence (in)completeness using logistic regression. Despite the database's accessibility and the relevance of most of its variables, the system has serious quality problems: confusing instructions in the information manual concerning missing data, misclassification of maternal occupation, lack of data on the informant's race/ethnicity, and high proportions of incomplete information. The system does not appear to be a reliable source for monitoring, evaluating, and planning measures to minimize infant health inequalities.",

The current generation of both computer hardware and the development tools available on the hardware have facilitated the creation of these infocentric applications. The willingness of healthcare professionals--from doctors and nurses to administrators--to become more involved in the design and implementation has created more sophisticated and appropriate application modules. Multiple development sites have resulted in more flexible systems which can be more readily adapted to a larger set of end users. The cumulative result of this current technology and professional involvement is a collection of systems which are better suited for the end user; and which are more cost effective to implement. If these current trends continued, it is possible that we will see much of the promise envisioned in the early days of HIS development available to the individual HIS user. However, the dynamic characteristics of the healthcare industry warn us that we cannot allow our systems to become stagnant. Everyone with computer responsibility must be vigilant to the kaleidoscopic modifications in requirements if the infocentric based systems are to be a propitious tool for the suppliers of healthcare services.",

Lederer, who spent ten years installing such systems before joining the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh (as assistant professor of business administration), is fully cognizant of the pitfalls involved and the problems that personnel departments encounter in the process. After discussing what an HRIS can accomplish, he gives a thoroughgoing, detailed approach to developing such a system--from cost justification, to the personnel department's relationship with the data-processing department at each step, to deciding between buying a packaged system and developing a new system internally. Most important, he emphasizes, is to define requirements precisely and completely at the outset--those who don't are in for a lot of costly headaches. Much more is covered in this comprehensive approach--not the least of which is (for packaged systems) vendor analysis and contract negotiation (the contract stipulates the vendor's responsibilities in terms of software, installation service, maintenance, training, and documentation). One popular strategy for negotiating a contract is to choose the best two vendors and compare their offers throughout the negotiation; this results in a contract with excellent leverage for the buyer.",

The Institute of Medicine's report on the computerized patient record has galvanized many in the health care field to rethink their methods of record keeping. Nurses need to examine the history of the nursing record and look toward the development of a comprehensive nursing information system. Nurses, along with the other disciplines, must examine what they want the system of the future to encompass. A suggested framework for the information system has four major nursing components: (1) data storage component, (2) transaction log, (3) nursing decision support systems, and (4) an engine to link and combine the first three components and to present a consistent easy-to-use interface to the nurse. Done properly, this approach will reduce the amount of time nurses spend charting, add dimension to their notation, and increase the efficiency of data usage for clinical practice. The nursing information system must allow information availability in a manner that accentuates quality practice while releasing the nurse from time-consuming record keeping. These goals are possible to meet, but only if nurses plan for the design now, before it becomes a fait accompli.",

It was inspired by work in Vietnam and other places. The article discusses the basic principles on which a well-functioning HIS needs to rest regardless of the technical means employed (paper, electronic devices). Eleven principles for designing or reforming a HIS are identified, including: explicit description of the underlying units (target population) and variables; no list of indicators to be fixed in advance; only one register per target population; technical coordination between registers and reports; correction algorithms; local use of data and indicators; autonomy of health institutions regarding the information that concerns them; and novel use of registers for various studies. Apart from their technical role, these principles give shape to the philosophy that underlies this article, and make clear that a HIS is not only a tool for collecting indicators; it is intimately tied to clinical and preventive practice, as well as to health management and health economy. In fact, it permeates the entire health system. It can potentially play a much more extended, varied, and useful role than simply that of providing health services to a community.",

The objective of this paper is to consider the design of information systems in terms of organizational contextual factors and user/decision-maker preferences relevant to the structure and operation of such information systems. A heuristic procedure is developed and applied to the design of information systems responsible for supporting effective parasitic disease control efforts. Recent research based on this application indicates substantial technical advantages to an intersectoral, multidimensional approach to parasitic disease control. In particular, analysis reveals that information system designs can significantly enhance the effectiveness of disease intervention through a higher level of sensitivity to such factors as disease etiology, socioeconomic conditions, and population health beliefs and perceptions.",

    "abstract": "To construct a large-scale clinical repository that accurately captures a detailed understanding of the data vital to the process of health care and that provides highly efficient access to patient information for the users of a clinical information system. Conventional approaches to data modeling encourage the development of a highly specific data schema in order to capture as much information as possible about a given domain. In contrast, current database technology functions most effectively for clinical databases when a generic data schema is used. The technique of \"generic data modeling\" is presented as a method of reconciling these opposing views of clinical data, using formal operations to transform a detailed schema into a generic one. A complex schema consisting of hundreds of entities and representing a rich set of constraints about the patient care domain is transformed into a generic schema consisting of roughly two dozen tables. The resulting database design is efficient for patient-oriented queries and is highly flexible in adapting to the changing information needs of a health care institution, particularly changes involving the collection of new data elements. Conventional approaches to data modeling can be used to develop rich, complex models of clinical data that are useful for understanding and managing the process of patient care. Generic data modeling techniques can successfully transform a detailed design into an efficient generic design that is flexible enough to meet the needs of an operational clinical information system.",

In numerous situations, time is wasted because of the lack of interoperability between systems.

Using a time-motion method, we compared expected versus effective time spent managing laboratory orders for two different computerized systems: one integrated, the other not integrated. Our results tend to show that nurses will complete their task an average of five times faster than their expected performance (p&lt;0.001). We also showed that a tightly integrated system provides a threefold speed gain for nurses compared to a non-integrated CPOE with the laboratory information system (p&lt;0.001). We evaluated the economic benefit of this gain, therefore arguing for a strong interoperability of systems, in addition to patient safety benefits.",

This paper argues that the health system needs internal mechanisms to develop performance targets, track progress, and create and manage knowledge for continuous improvement. Based on documented RHIS weaknesses, we have developed the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework, an innovative approach to design, strengthen and evaluate RHIS. The PRISM framework offers a paradigm shift by putting emphasis on RHIS performance and incorporating the organizational, technical and behavioural determinants of performance. By describing causal pathways of these determinants, the PRISM framework encourages and guides the development of interventions for strengthening or reforming RHIS. Furthermore, it conceptualizes and proposes a methodology for measuring the impact of RHIS on health system performance. Ultimately, the PRISM framework, in spite of its challenges and competing paradigms, proposes a new agenda for building and sustaining information systems, for the promotion of an information culture, and for encouraging accountability in health systems.",

The study was carried out in seven selected districts in all provinces of Pakistan. The strengths highlighted were the sustainability of system even after suspension of funds from donors; vast coverage of over ten thousand health facilities, logistics and drug support systems. The weaknesses included scarcity of resources (i.e. skilled personnel and financial resources), contentious quality and underutilization of data; lack of motivation and feedback among health managers. There is a need to instigate organizational development and institutional strengthening initiatives. These may include defining the structure of organizations; specifying the roles, responsibilities and defining a career structure; managing resources; overhauling the training activity, right from needs assessment to evaluation; creating sense of responsibility; motivating the staff; giving incentives for good work and inculcating work ethics.",

MobiDis is an information system that includes healthcare consumers and providers in a unique, virtual organisation aimed at promoting a patient centric paradigm in healthcare. It allows logons from desktop or laptop computers, as well as wireless PDAs or tablet PCs connected to Internet. In MobiDis the clinical data of each consumer are stored in the consumer's virtual healthcare record (VHR), a highly structured entity that exists on the network and is simultaneously updated with information from multiple locations. The MobiDis architecture creates an environment for VHRs by providing them with a large variety of services. In order to prove that our proposed architectural solution meets the project goals a prototype was developed. The paper describes the MobiDis architecture and the VHR services, and briefly presents the prototype.",

In this paper, by considering the unknown values, which can be seen everywhere in real world applications, the incomplete multiscale information system is firstly investigated. The descriptor technique is employed to construct rough sets at different scales for analyzing the hierarchically structured data. The problem of unravelling decision rules at different scales is also addressed. Finally, the reduct descriptors are formulated to simplify decision rules, which can be derived from different scales. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.",

In addition, these referenceable report databases can be used to facilitate the practice of evidence based medicine, through data-driven meta-analysis and determination of best practice guidelines. This concept will only be realized if the customized data delivery technology provides real and tangible value to end users, accentuates workflow, can be seamlessly integrated into existing information system technologies, and be shown to yield reproducibility of the evidence domain.

    "abstract": "In order to improve the quality of patient care, while at the same time keeping up with the pace of increased needs of the population for healthcare services that directly impacts on the cost of care delivery processes, the Republic of Croatia, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has formed a strategy and campaign for national public healthcare system reform. The strategy is very comprehensive and addresses all niches of care delivery processes; it is founded on the enterprise information systems that will aim to support end-to-end business processes in the healthcare domain. Two major requirements are in focus: (1) to provide efficient healthcare-related data management in support of decision-making processes; (2) to support a continuous process of healthcare resource spending optimisation. The first project is the Integrated Healthcare Information System (IHCIS) on the primary care level; this encompasses the integration of all primary point-of-care facilities and subjects with the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance and Croatian National Institute of Public Health. In years to come, IHCIS will serve as the main integration platform for connecting all other stakeholders and levels of health care (that is, hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories) into a single enterprise healthcare network. This article gives an overview of Croatian public healthcare system strategy aims and goals, and focuses on properties and characteristics of the primary care project implementation that started in 2003; it achieved a major milestone in early 2007 - the official grand opening of the project with 350 GPs already fully connected to the integrated healthcare information infrastructure based on the IHCIS solution.",

The autonomy of health authorities and specialized structures created numerous independent health information systems with different methods of data collection. Although the issues of decentralization and a unified health system had been agreed on in 1963, they had not been implemented until the new health policy reform was lunched in 1988. The reform was based on the strengthening of primary health care at national level and accelerating decentralization of health systems. However, in spite of strong political will the new health managers at local level are lacking essential information, data and instruments that only a decentralized health management information system can provide. Based on a study conducted in the Cearà State of the north east of Brazil, explores how the present health information system can support the process of decentralization.",

In response to the epidemic, a variety of intervention and prevention programs have been instituted. In such AIDS intervention and prevention (AIP) activities, the role played by information systems becomes more and more important. The applications of information systems technology in AIP mostly seem to fall within a spectrum of databases, decision support systems and expert systems. This paper describes the implementation of an information system in a regional AIDS intervention and prevention program. In this integrative information system, the database is integrated with both decision support systems and expert systems, and decision support systems are integrated with expert systems. The implementation results of the system present evidence of the usefulness of the system in AIDS intervention and prevention.",

    "abstract": "A Disease Management System (DMS) refers to an integrated healthcare delivery system that provides patient centered care throughout the course of the disease independent of delivery site. A fundamental barrier for the development, implementation and monitoring of a DMS is lack of an appreciation by care providers of the complexity of these systems, and what is required for their maintenance. Foremost in the development of these systems is the presence of information systems that attempt to deal with the temporal, spatial and information needs of the DMS. The Zachman Framework for Information Systems Architecture is used in many industries in the development of information systems. Its choice is based on the recognition of a need for a methodology in the conceptualization and modeling of complex information systems. This paper provides a brief overview of the Zachman Framework and its potential application in DMS development. In particular it will be the focus on the need for \"perspective\" clarification as the first step in the development of such complex systems. This paper reviews DMS and their potential information needs. The clarification of \"perspectives\" provides a method toward team building and unification of purpose by decreasing conflict and recognizing the unique contributions that each perspective holder makes.",

    "abstract": "Health services are increasingly under pressure to develop information systems that are responsive to changing health needs and appropriate to service objectives. Developing an essential data set provides managers with a clearly defined set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating services. This article describes a process that resulted in the creation of an essential data set at district level. This had a significant impact on neighbouring districts and resulted in the development of a regional essential data set, which in turn helped to influence the creation of a provincial and then national essential data set. Four key lessons may be drawn from the process. The development of an essential data set both requires and can contribute to a process that allows the reporting requirements to be adjusted over time in response to changing circumstances. In addition, it contributes to (and requires) the integration of programme reporting requirements into a coherent information system. While the case study describes a bottom-up approach, a top-down consultative process is advocated because it establishes a framework within which information needs can be reviewed. Lastly, the use of surveys can aid efforts to keep the essential elements to a minimum. In conclusion, the development of an essential data set contributes to strengthening health services because it necessitates dialogue between programme managers and defines indicators to be monitored by them.",

This paper's contribution is the development of the Social Information System Connectivity Framework for supporting SIS design in healthcare. The framework has three parts. First, it defines the structure of a SIS as a set of social triads. Second, it identifies six dimensions that represent the behaviour of a SIS. Third, it proposes the Social Information System Connectivity Factor as our approximation of the extent of connectivity and degree of complexity in a SIS.",

    "title": "Understanding managerial behaviour during initial steps of a clinical information system adoption.",
    "abstract": "While the study of the information technology (IT) implementation process and its outcomes has received considerable attention, the examination of pre-adoption and pre-implementation stages of configurable IT uptake appear largely under-investigated. This paper explores managerial behaviour during the periods prior the effective implementation of a clinical information system (CIS) by two Canadian university multi-hospital centers. Adopting a structurationist theoretical stance and a case study research design, the processes by which CIS managers' patterns of discourse contribute to the configuration of the new technology in their respective organizational contexts were longitudinally examined over 33 months. Although managers seemed to be aware of the risks and organizational impact of the adoption of a new clinical information system, their decisions and actions over the periods examined appeared rather to be driven by financial constraints and power struggles between different groups involved in the process. Furthermore, they largely emphasized technological aspects of the implementation, with organizational dimensions being put aside. In view of these results, the notion of 'rhetorical ambivalence' is proposed. Results are further discussed in relation to the significance of initial decisions and actions for the subsequent implementation phases of the technology being configured. Theoretical and empirically grounded, the paper contributes to the underdeveloped body of literature on information system pre-implementation processes by revealing the crucial role played by managers during the initial phases of a CIS adoption.",

    "abstract": "Nursing Vocabulary Summit participants were challenged to consider whether reference terminology and information models might be a way to move toward better capture of data in electronic medical records. A requirement of such reference models is fidelity to representations of domain knowledge. This article discusses embedded structures in three different approaches to organizing domain knowledge: scientific reasoning, expertise, and standardized nursing languages. The concept of pressure ulcer is presented as an example of the various ways lexical elements used in relation to a specific concept are organized across systems. Different approaches to structuring information-the clinical information system, minimum data sets, and standardized messaging formats-are similarly discussed. Recommendations include identification of the polyhierarchies and categorical structures required within a reference terminology, systematic evaluations of the extent to which structured information accurately and completely represents domain knowledge, and modifications or extensions to existing multidisciplinary efforts.",

    "abstract": "Information and communication technologies progress rapidly and many novel applications have been developed in many domains of human life. In recent years, the demand for healthcare services has been growing because of the increase in the elderly population. Consequently, a number of healthcare institutions have focused on creating technologies to reduce extraneous work and improve the quality of service. In this study, an information platform for tele- healthcare services was implemented. The architecture of the platform included a web-based application server and client system. The client system was able to retrieve the blood pressure and glucose levels of a patient stored in measurement instruments through Bluetooth wireless transmission. The web application server assisted the staffs and clients in analyzing the health conditions of patients. In addition, the server provided face-to-face communications and instructions through remote video devices. The platform deployed a service-oriented architecture, which consisted of HL7 standard messages and web service components. The platform could transfer health records into HL7 standard clinical document architecture for data exchange with other organizations. The prototyping system was pretested and evaluated in a homecare department of hospital and a community management center for chronic disease monitoring. Based on the results of this study, this system is expected to improve the quality of healthcare services.",

In order to overcome known issues regarding development, implementation and finally acceptance of a CIS by the physicians we decided to develop a novel object-oriented methodology by integrating usability principles and techniques in a simplified version of a well established software engineering process (SEP), the Unified Process (UP). A multilayer architecture has been defined and implemented with the use of a vendor application framework. Our first experiences from a pilot implementation of our CIS are positive. This approach allowed us to gain a socio-technical understanding of the domain and enabled us to identify all the important factors that define both the structure and the behavior of a Health Information System.",

The system was designed to build on from national standards that identify healthcare workers, organizations and the relationships among them and reuse as much as possible existing concepts and software. At the same time, the system should reduce fragmentation, not only by integrating existing redundant or competing systems but also by providing a framework in which new modules would be naturally integrated to each other. Today, the web-based system, known as SIGA Saúde, runs in more than 370 healthcare units, processes some 8 thousand appointment scheduling daily and more than 10 thousand high-cost procedure authorizations monthly.

    "title": "Use of epidemiologic data in Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) assessments.",
    "abstract": "In human health risk assessment, information from epidemiologic studies is typically utilized in the hazard identification step of the risk assessment paradigm. However, in the assessment of many chemicals by the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), epidemiologic data, both observational and experimental, have also been used in the derivation of toxicological risk estimates (i.e., reference doses [RfD], reference concentrations [RfC], oral cancer slope factors [CSF] and inhalation unit risks [IUR]). Of the 545 health assessments posted on the IRIS database as of June 2007, 44 assessments derived non-cancer or cancer risk estimates based on human data. RfD and RfC calculations were based on a spectrum of endpoints from changes in enzyme activity to specific neurological or dermal effects. There are 12 assessments with IURs based on human data, two assessments that extrapolated human inhalation data to derive CSFs and one that used human data to directly derive a CSF. Lung or respiratory cancer is the most common endpoint for cancer assessments based on human data. To date, only one chemical, benzene, has utilized human data for derivation of all three quantitative risk estimates (i.e., RfC, RfD, and dose-response modeling for cancer assessment). Through examples from the IRIS database, this paper will demonstrate how epidemiologic data have been used in IRIS assessments for both adding to the body of evidence in the hazard identification process and in the quantification of risk estimates in the dose-response component of the risk assessment paradigm.",

The integrated medical information system of hospitals consists of an Order Communication System (OCS), Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS), and Laboratory Information System (LIS), as well as Electronic Medical Record (EMR). It is designed so that remote health screening and patient data search can be accessed through a high speed network-even in remote areas-in order to effectively manage data on medical treatment that patients received at their respective hospitals. The existing oriental treatment system is one in which the doctor requires the patient to visit the hospital in person, so as to be able to check the patient's pulse and measure it with his hand for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the recent development of digitalized medical measurement equipment, not only can doctors now check a patient's pulse without touching it directly, but the measured data are computerized and stored into the database as the electronic obligation record. Thus, even if a patient cannot visit the hospital, proper medical treatment is available by analyzing the patient's medical history and diagnosis process in the remote area. Furthermore, when a comprehensive medical testing center system including the people medical examination and diverse physical examination is established, the quality of medical service is expected to be improved than now.",

    "title": "Computerized tracking of mammography patients: value of a radiology information system integrated with a personal-computer data base.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. We investigated the advantages of using a radiology information system as the primary data source for a mammographic patient-tracking system that is based on a personal-computer local-area network and that requires almost no data entry. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. Our mammographic data base is maintained on a file server that provides cross-platform access to both Macintosh and IBM-compatible personal computers. Locally developed software automatically transfers mammographic data from our radiology information system to the file server's mammographic data base. The data transferred include patients' demographics (e.g., hospital identification number, address, referring physician) and the complete mammographic report. With the use of specific terminology, the need for follow-up can be automatically gleaned from the mammographic report and coded within the data base. Graphically oriented, commercially available software provides easy access to this information from any personal computer on our department's network. The software provides considerable flexibility for searching and manipulating the data without the need for customized data-base programming. Redundant data entry and associated errors are drastically reduced, as are personnel requirements for maintaining the system. Relative to most commercial radiology information systems, a personal computer facilitates the steps involved in tracking patients and obtaining highly customized analyses of the mammographic data base. The data in the mammographic data base exactly match those in the hospital's registration data and are easily transferred to other personal-computer programs for ancillary processing. CONCLUSION. This technique is ideal for departments that use a general-purpose radiology information system for mammographic reporting, yet need a more powerful but user-friendly and low-cost method for tracking their mammography patients.",

This report presents findings on the evaluation of this system after 2 1/2 years of operation in relationship to the initial objectives developed in the justification study. The impact of the system on personnel (intra- and extradepartmental) as it relates to daily activities was also considered. The effectiveness of the system in contributing to the goals of improving the operation and management of the laboratory by enhancing communication of our services toward quality patient care was carefully studied through users' opinion surveys evaluation. The evaluation plan is developed by first describing the initial basic system, initial costs, and the impact of continuing cost to the institution (service, software modification, etc.). The department's problem areas were identified along with deviations from the justification expectations of the LIS. The conditions existing currently and attitudes of user personnel toward the system were surveyed at all levels of the institution. The survey revealed that 20 (87%) of 23 specific goals or expectations stated in the original justification report were satisfied. There was a partial achievement of 2 objectives (8.7%), and 1 (4.3%) was not achieved. The survey also revealed a net annual cost reduction of 128,756 as a result of the LIS. Payback period to recover the entire systems's cost is estimated at 4.0 years. This includes all purchased hardware and software to date.",

The study began in 1987 as a national effort to implement decision support technologies in the Veterans Administration Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP). The specific objectives of this project were to (1) examine one particular decision support technology, (2) identify the technical and organizational barriers to the implementation of a CCIS in the VA host environment, (3) assess the possible benefits of this system to VA clinicians in terms of therapeutic decision making, and (4) develop new methods for identifying the clinical utility of a computer program designed to provide clinicians with a new information tool. The project was conducted intermittently over a three-year period at three VA medical centers chosen as implementation and evaluation test sites for Micromedex. Findings from the Kansas City Medical Center in Missouri are presented to illustrate some of the technical problems associated with the implementation of a commercial database program in the DHCP host environment, the organizational factors influencing clinical use of the system, and the methods used to evaluate its use. Data from 4581 provider encounters with the CCIS are summarized. Usage statistics are presented to illustrate the methodological possibilities for assessing the \"benefits and burdens\" of a computerized information system by using an automated collection of user demographics and program audit trails that allow evaluators to monitor user interactions with different segments of the database.",

    "title": "Working towards a national health information system in Australia.",
    "abstract": "One of the major administrative dilemmas facing the Australian national health care system is the need to reform practices associated with massive data-information overload. The current system is burdened with paper-based administrative forms, patient record files, referral notes and other manual methods of data organisation. An integrated computer-based information system may be perceived as an attractive solution to such burdens. However, computerisation must not be seen as a panacea with the possibility of exacerbating information overload and accentuating privacy concerns. Recent surveys in Australia [1] and the US [2] indicate a perceived causal link between computers and privacy invasion. Any moves toward a national health information system must counter this perception through macro-level education schemes of affected parties and micro-level mechanisms such as the establishment of hospital privacy officers. Such concerns may be viewed as a subset of the wider privacy debate, and information policy development should address such considerations to develop policies to prevent unauthorized access to personal information and to avoid the extraction and sale of sensitive health data. Conservative in nature and slow to change the health care sector may be forced to adopt more efficient work practices through the increasing proliferation of information technology (IT) in health care delivery and an escalating emphasis upon accountability and efficiency of the public health care dollar. The economic rationalist stance taken by governments in Australia and other nations generally will also force health care workers to adopt and develop more efficient information management practices, health indicators and best practice care methods than presently employed by this sector The benefits of a national health information system are far reaching, particularly in developing a more effective health care system through better identifying and understanding community health care trends and in applying IT to the efficient collection of data for the development of more appropriate performance measures and statistical indicators. A coherent and integrated approach is called for in the design of a national health information system which incorporates the necessary and requisite security features to meet privacy concerns. Protecting information privacy poses complex political, economic, technological, legal and social problems for systems developers and health care providers alike [2]. According to Brannigan [3] there are three components involved in the formulation and implementation of privacy: public policy (What level of privacy does society want?); legal structure (Does the law adequately provide for society's privacy requirements?); and technical (how much privacy can technical tools provide, at what cost, and with what effects on the system?). Examining technical tools alone, it is apparent that the necessary technologies are available in Australia to provide the security of medical records required by public policy. Such tools may include encryption, user and data authentication methods, authorisation schemes and mechanisms for the prevention of data inference. While none of these available measures are infallible, it is suitable for most applications where the encryption mechanism can provide protection for a given length of time. Australia needs to develop a coherent national health information infrastructure policy to ultimately avoid fragmented, duplicated and incompatible systems that rely on different standards and protocols. Such a policy will only work by addressing the key issue of patient privacy within a technological framework. The application of IT to health care systems is a sensitive social experiment affecting many professions including general practitioners, medical administrators, politicians, lawyers, computer specialists, privacy advocates and patients whose records will ultimately reside in the system.

    "abstract": "An integrated EPR (Electronic Patient Record) information system of all the patients provides the medical institutions and the academia with most of the patients' information in details for them to make corrective decisions and clinical decisions in order to maintain and analyze patients' health. In such system, the illegal access must be restricted and the information from theft during transmission over the insecure Internet must be prevented. Lee et al. proposed an efficient password-based remote user authentication scheme using smart card for the integrated EPR information system. Their scheme is very efficient due to usage of one-way hash function and bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operations. However, in this paper, we show that though their scheme is very efficient, their scheme has three security weaknesses such as (1) it has design flaws in password change phase, (2) it fails to protect privileged insider attack and (3) it lacks the formal security verification. We also find that another recently proposed Wen's scheme has the same security drawbacks as in Lee at al.'s scheme. In order to remedy these security weaknesses found in Lee et al.'s scheme and Wen's scheme, we propose a secure and efficient password-based remote user authentication scheme using smart cards for the integrated EPR information system. We show that our scheme is also efficient as compared to Lee et al.'s scheme and Wen's scheme as our scheme only uses one-way hash function and bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operations. Through the security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks.",

    "abstract": "The needs of information for the primary health care centers planning and management, and the poor situation we started from, have generated a large amount of information systems, which, as a general rule, have not been sufficiently evaluated. Since 1986, in the Area de Gestión, 7, Centro, of the ICS here exists an information system of the general medicine services with a sampling method (ANAC-2). The validation of some aspects of the process and content is shown in order to evaluate the quality of information. The problems arisen during the process of collecting data from nine centers are analyzed during six months and its information content is compared with the one of each system with a standard respect their value. To evaluate the concordance, we have used a graphic representation of the differences of each system with a standard respect their mean value, and the \"limits of agreement\". On relation with the problems of collecting data, two centers show a nonfulfillment of the observation calendar higher than 20% and the logical divergences are not important. The kind of visits distribution is quite correct, even if the estimate of the whole number of visits is higher than 20% in two centers. In the activity indicators, the system of reference has a tendency to give average values lower than the ANAC-2, with the exception of prescription/visit. In referrals and prescriptions, the use of different sources of information between systems produces an average difference of 3.3 interconsults/100 visits and 0.8 prescriptions/visit respectively. Generally, the limits of agreement are wide and become unacceptable in laboratory. The study carried out is evaluated positively, for it detects the problematical areas which can be modified or require further studies. The importance of validating the information systems is emphasized, in spite of difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Despite the best efforts of local healthcare workers and health officials, Nunavut, a large geographical region in Northern Canada, has struggled with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD). We contend that the implementation of an immunisation information system (IIS) could strengthen prevention and response efforts to this and future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Developing an IIS in Nunavut that builds on the existing CANImmunize infrastructure would reduce the cost and complexity of developing a new IIS, and allow Nunavut to benefit from the ongoing efforts to secure data on the CANImmunize platform. Such a system would enable the identification of individuals and subpopulations at highest risk of infection based on vaccine series completion and permit the exploration of the underlying causes of outbreaks in the territory through consideration of demographic and temporal factors. Confirmed high rates of vaccination in the context of an outbreak would indicate potential issues with vaccine efficacy while low rates of vaccination would suggest that efforts should be devoted to increasing vaccine coverage. This approach could also lay the foundation for infrastructure expansion to other remote and/or Indigenous communities where geographical and accessibility issues complicate health care utilisation and monitoring, both in Canada and internationally.",

    "abstract": "European legislation stipulates that genetically modified organisms (GMO) have to be monitored to identify potential adverse environmental effects. A wealth of different types of monitoring data from various sources including existing environmental monitoring programmes is expected to accumulate. This requires an information system to efficiently structure, process and evaluate the monitoring data. A structure for an Information System for Monitoring GMO (ISMO) was developed by a multidisciplinary research team. It is based on the requirement to organise all relevant information in a logical, readily accessible and functional manner. For the ISMO, we present a combination of three interrelated components: Firstly, an ISMO should comprise a knowledge database structured according to information related to the different scale levels of biological organisation relevant to GMO monitoring and scientific hypotheses on cause-effects which should be validated by monitoring data. Secondly, a monitoring database should be part of an ISMO containing GMO-specific monitoring data and meta-data. This monitoring database should be linked with monitoring data from other monitoring programmes which are relevant for GMO-related questions. Thirdly, an ISMO should encompass a database covering administrative and procedural data. Neither national nor international approaches to an ISMO exist yet. An ISMO as designed in this paper could support competent authorities in both the GMO notification process and in post-market monitoring. This includes evaluating the environmental risks of experimentally releasing GMO and placing them on the market, assessing monitoring plans and evaluating monitoring results. The ISMO should be implemented on both the national and international level, preferably combining different administrative scales. Harmonisation approaches towards GMO monitoring data are at an initial stage, but they are a precondition to coordinated GMO monitoring and to successfully implementing an ISMO. It is recommended to set up a legal basis and to agree on common strategies for the data coordination and harmonisation.",

The clinical decision can be considered the dependent output variable in a process in which the information system, the patient, clinician characteristics and the environment are the independent input variables.

Approaches using patients outcomes are problematic because of indirect relationship between the information system and patient outcomes, which limits both sensitivity and validity. A process measure technique that focuses on the clinical decision directly as the measure of output could be appropriate if the represented a generic sampling of clinical decisions made in ambulatory care.

Several discussions have indicated that information technology plays an important role in the era of disease management. Whereas applications have been developed, it is inefficient to develop information system for each disease management program individually. The aim of this research is to support the work of disease management, reform the inefficient workflow, and propose an architecture model that enhance on the reusability and time saving of information system development. The proposed architecture model had been successfully implemented into two disease management information system, and the result was evaluated through reusability analysis, time consumed analysis, pre- and post-implement workflow analysis, and user questionnaire survey. The reusability of the proposed model was high, less than half of the time was consumed, and the workflow had been improved. The overall user aspect is positive. The supportiveness during daily workflow is high. The system empowers the case managers with better information and leads to better decision making.",

    "abstract": "Information system integration is an important dimension of a company's information system maturity and plays a relevant role in meeting information needs and accountability targets. However, no generalizable evidence exists about whether and how the main integrating technologies influence information system integration in health care organizations. This study examined how integrating technologies are adopted in public health care organizations and chief information officers' (CIOs) perceptions about their influence on information system integration. We used primary data on integrating technologies' adoption and CIOs' perception regarding information system integration in public health care organizations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the relationship between CIOs' perception about information system integration and the adopted technologies. Data from 90 health care organizations were available for analyses. Integrating technologies are relatively diffused in public health care organizations, and CIOs seem to shape information system toward integrated architectures. There is a significant positive (although modest, .3) correlation between the number of integrating technologies adopted and the CIO's satisfaction with them. However, regression analysis suggests that organizations covering a broader spectrum of these technologies are less likely to have their CIO reporting main problems concerning integration in the administrative area of the information system compared with the clinical area and where the two areas overlap. Integrating technologies are associated with less perceived problems in the information system administrative area rather than in other areas. Because CIOs play the role of information resource allocators, by influencing information system toward integrated architecture, health care organization leaders should foster cooperation between CIOs and medical staff to enhance information system integration.",

The paper analyses 1) how informed consent can be implemented in the system and how different implementations create different impacts on autonomy and control of information, and 2) arguments directed towards justifying not seeking informed consent in this context. Based on the analysis a heuristic is provided which enables a ranking and estimation of the impact on autonomy and control of information of different options for consent to entry of data into the system and use of data from the system.The danger of routinisation of consent is identified.The Danish pharmaceutical information system raises issues in relation to autonomy and control of information, issues that will also occur in relation to other similar comprehensive health information systems. Some of these issues are well understood and their impact can be judged using the heuristic which is provided. More research is, however needed in relation to routinisation of consent.",

    "abstract": "The APACHE III data base reflects the disease, physiologic status, and outcome data from 17,400 ICU patients at 40 hospitals, 26 of which were randomly selected from representative geographic regions, bed size, and teaching status. This provides a nationally representative standard for measuring several important aspects of ICU performance. Results from the study have now been used to develop an automated information system to provide real time information about expected ICU patient outcome, length of stay, production cost, and ICU performance. The information system provides several new capabilities to ICU clinicians, clinic, and hospital administrators. Among the system's capabilities are: the ability to compare local ICU performance against predetermined criteria; the ability to forecast nursing requirements; and, the ability to make both individual and group patient outcome predictions. The system also provides improved administrative support by tracking ICU charges at the point of origin and reduces staff workload eliminating the requirement for several manually maintained logs and patient lists. APACHE III has the capability to electronically interface with and utilize data already captured in existing hospital information systems, automated laboratory information systems, and patient monitoring systems. APACHE III will also be completely integrated with several CIS vendors' products.",

The project focused on the aspects considered in the literature as critical factors for a successful deployment and usage of a health information system. System usability, adequate technology, integration of clinical routines, real-time statistical analysis of data, information confidentiality and standard protocol-based external interconnection were the key aspects considered. The developed system is based on a web application with a modular and layered architecture accounting for usability, ease of maintenance and further system development. Evaluation of system usability was carried at three and fifteen months after system deployment to analyze the advantages/disadvantages experienced by the end-users. A thorough prior analysis of clinical activities and workflows, the use of the adequate technology, and the availability of data analysis tools will almost guarantee success in the deployment of an Oncology Information System.",

To enable such a CDS architecture, the Health Level 7 CDS Work Group reviewed the literature, hosted multi-stakeholder discussions, and consulted domain experts to identify and prioritize the services and capabilities required from clinical information systems (CISs) to enable service-oriented CDS. In addition, relevant available standards were identified. Through this process, ten CIS services and eight CIS capabilities were identified as being important for enabling scalable, service-oriented CDS. In particular, through a survey of 46 domain experts, five services and capabilities were identified as being especially critical: 1) the use of standard information models and terminologies; 2) the ability to leverage a Decision Support Service (DSS); 3) support for a clinical data query service; 4) support for an event subscription and notification service; and 5) support for a user communication service.",

This can lead to quicker access to desired information, which may facilitate the decision-making process. Qualitative methods such as interviews, observations and surveys have been commonly used to gain an understanding of clinician information needs. We introduce clinical information system (CIS) log analysis as a method for identifying patient-specific information needs and CIS log mining as an automated technique for discovering such needs in CIS log files. We have applied this method to WebCIS (Web-based Clinical Information System) log files to discover patterns of usage. The results can be used to guide design and development of relevant clinical information systems. This paper discusses the motivation behind the development of this method, describes CIS log analysis and mining, presents preliminary results and summarizes how the results can be applied.",

NEMSIS is being designed to provide a uniform national EMS dataset, with standard terms, definitions, and values, as well as a national EMS database, with aggregated data from all states on a limited number of data elements. Forty-eight of the states, the District of Columbia, and three territories signed a memorandum of agreement documenting support for the NEMSIS project and expressing a desire for full implementation of the NEMSIS dataset. NHTSA has agreed to house the National EMS Database at its National Center for Statistics and Analysis. NHTSA, in cooperation with HRSA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently entered into a cooperative agreement with the University of Utah School of Medicine to operate a NEMSIS Technical Assistance Center that will provide related assistance to official EMS agencies and to commercial software vendors. The Technical Assistance Center will also biannually assess state and territorial capabilities to provide data to the national EMS database. NEMSIS will provide a uniform national EMS dataset, with standard terms, definitions, and values, as well as a national EMS database, with aggregated data from all states on a limited number of data elements.

    "abstract": "Health Information Systems are potential instruments to analyze health situation; however, the non-compulsory filling of a single common field makes it difficult to link systems' data. This study aimed to describe and evaluate the adequacy of the strategies used to perform data linkage between databases from the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) as to records for breast cancer control. The Breast Cancer Control Information Systems (SISMAMA), the Outpatient Information System (SIA, through Individualized Outpatient Service Production - BPA-I - and High-Complexity Outpatient Procedures Authorization Forms - APAC), the Hospital Information System (SIH), and the Mortality Information System (SIM) were linked probabilistically. The baseline was constructed by records with \"suspected\" and \"highly suspected malignancy\" from the second half of 2010. The linkage strategy included 15 steps. Registries with the national health service user card (CNS) or social security number (SSN) were used to estimate the sensitivity of the strategy, considering matches between records identified in the initial steps as gold standard, when these fields were used as key for blocking. Using CNS and the SSN as a linkage strategy allowed to identify the high proportion of true matches across databases in which these variables were inputted: 47.3% in follow-up mammography records, 41.4% in SIH, and 45.5% in APAC. The sensitivity of the linkage strategy was 100%. The study showed that the strategies were satisfactory and the use of CNS and SSN allowed many matches, even without critical proceedings and with the possibility of linkage between databases based on information from only a few identification fields.",

Using a descriptive methodology, nursing documentation in one CPR was examined for prevalence and content of free text documentation in an otherwise structured nursing information system (NIS). Results demonstrate house wide use of free text (narrative note) fields. Variability in use unrelated to patient acuity suggests idiosyncratic individual or unit documentation practices.

    "abstract": "The experience of clinicians at two public hospitals in Sydney, Australia, with the introduction and use of an oncology information system (OIS) was examined to extract lessons to guide the introduction of clinical information systems in public hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of 15 radiation oncologists employed at the two hospitals. The personnel involved in the decision making process for the introduction of the system were contacted and their decision making process revisited. The transcribed data were analyzed using NVIVO software. Themes emerged included implementation strategies and practices, the radiation oncologists' current use and satisfaction with the OIS, project management and the impact of the OIS on clinical practice. The hospitals had contrasting experiences in their introduction and use of the OIS. Hospital A used the OIS in all aspects of clinical documentation. Its implementation was associated with strong advocacy by the Head of Department, input by a designated project manager, and use and development of the system by all staff, with timely training and support. With no vision of developing a paperless information system, Hospital B used the OIS only for booking and patient tracking. A departmental policy that data entry for the OIS was centrally undertaken by administrative staff distanced clinicians from the system. All the clinicians considered that the OIS should continuously evolve to meet changing clinical needs and departmental quality improvement initiatives. This case study indicates that critical factors for the successful introduction of clinical information systems into hospital environment were an initial clear vision to be paperless, strong clinical leadership and management at the departmental level, committed project management, and involvement of all staff, with appropriate training. Clinician engagement is essential for post-adoption evolution of clinical information systems.",

PROMIS domains include physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, and social health. Various studies have reported increased utilization of PROMIS in research articles in specific specialties; however, the extent to which PROMIS has been employed in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to characterize the prevalence and trends of PROMIS within plastic and reconstructive surgery articles. Literature search was conducted across multiple databases for PROMIS studies within plastic surgery literature. We identified 136 articles and the following data were extracted: author name, journal, impact factor, country of origin, year of publication, publication type, subspecialty, study size, and PROMIS measures used. In this study, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was an overall increasing trend in the number of PROMIS studies published. The most common subspecialties that used PROMIS measures were general reconstruction (n = 24), hand (n = 9), and burn (n = 5). The most used PROMIS measures were the pain interference (n = 26), pain intensity (n = 15), and depression (n = 13). A total of 24 journals included PROMIS studies with a mean impact factor of 3.73 (SD = 3.2). The most common country of origin was the United States (n = 42). The data demonstrated an increasing use of PROMIS within plastic surgery across a wide variety of subspecialities and study designs. The characterization of these trends allows researchers and clinicians alike to gain a greater understanding of this powerful tool in measuring patient care.",

    "title": "Development and deployment of a health information system in transitional countries (croatian experience).",
    "abstract": "Croatian Primary Health Care Information System pilot project, conducted between 2001 and 2003, aimed to develop and deploy a health information system based on the latest technologies which would improve the quality of primary health care and rationalise the consumption. 60 primary health care teams (physician and nurse) were equipped with PCs and connected via central server to the main national health insurer, state treasury and public health institute. Developed information system enabled rapid retrieval of documents, replacement of manual data input and a real-time insight into needed information as well as prompt interventions within the system. The project also introduced electronic smart cards for physicians and nurses, so that at each medical check-up the information system verified both the ensuree's and the physician's or nurse's status and rights.Based on the experiences from the pilot project, plan has been made for comprehensive health information system at national level which would connect primary health care teams, hospitals, laboratories, dentistries, health insurance companies, state treasury, public health institutes and electronic health records database. Its major goals are more rapid diagnostics, accuracy in prescribing therapy, standardisation of the good practice as well as better utilisation of capacities, shorter waiting times and shorter stays in hospitals, which would lead to improvement in overall health care quality and better control over the health care consumption. Estimated 5-year investment for installing such system would be 125 million EUR. However, information system could save substantially more and yield a return of investment in only two years.As information system for primary health care should be a strategic component of every health care reform and development plan, we can recommend our model, based on the results of the pilot project, to other transitional countries.",

    "title": "Implementing a new health management information system in Uganda.",
    "abstract": "This paper reports on research investigating the health management information system (HMIS) implementation process in Uganda, utilizing the diffusion of innovation and dynamic equilibrium organizational change models. Neither perspective guided the HMIS development process. Instead, technological issues, rather than wider organizational issues, dominated the planned change. The need to consider the organizational context when changing information systems arises because the process is more complex than some practitioners have realized, when attempting to understand the causes of information management problems and developing HMIS in low-income countries. In particular, information system developers had not acknowledged that they were promoting an informational approach to management when they promoted a change from a centralized reporting system to a HMIS supporting use of information at the level of collection. Strategies to facilitate this approach were not advocated. Organizational theory can contribute to the diffusion of innovation framework. It has yielded an integration of Rogers's diffusion of innovation framework and Leavitt's concept of organizational forces in equilibrium. The diffusion framework describes the process, but the organizational model has given the context and reason for aspects of the process. The diffusion model does not predict what needs to change within the organization when a particular innovation is introduced, or how much. The addition of the organizational model has helped. These frameworks can facilitate the introduction of future information management innovations and allow practitioners to perceive their introduction as a staged process needing to be managed. Implications for practice are identified.",

When such an event occurs, hospitals are required to instantly switch from their routine activity to conditions of great uncertainty and confront needs that exceed resources. We describe an information system that was uniquely designed for managing mass casualty events. The web-based system is activated when a mass casualty event is declared; it displays relevant operating procedures, checklists, and a log book. The system automatically or semiautomatically initiates phone calls and public address announcements. It collects real-time data from computerized clinical and administrative systems in the hospital, and presents them to the managing team in a clear graphic display. It also generates periodic reports and summaries of available or scarce resources that are sent to predefined recipients. When the system was tested in a nationwide exercise, it proved to be an invaluable tool for informed decision making in demanding and overwhelming situations such as mass casualty events.",

    "abstract": "Smart and practical health information systems and applications with fewer errors are crucial for healthcare facilities. One method that ensures the proper design of health information systems (HIS) and applications is usability evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the usability of the emergency information systems used at the emergency departments of four educational hospitals in Kerman, Iran. This study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the information systems' errors and shortages were identified using a semi-structured questionnaire by users (nurses and the IT staff). In the second phase, based on the results of the first phase, two questionnaires were designed for each group of users to their opinions about the usability of the emergency information systems. The average score of \"reducing and facilitating user's daily activities\" was significantly different among hospitals (p = 0.03). Shahid Beheshti Hospital obtained the lowest usability score (17.5), and Afzalipour Hospital received the highest usability score (21.75). Moreover, the average score in \"use of the HIS\" for nurses and IT staff was 2.93 and 3.54 on a scale of 5, respectively. Usability evaluation of health information systems is essential to ensure that these systems provide sufficient and accurate information and requirements for users and health care providers. Also, modifying health information systems based on the user views and expectations improves the quality of the system and user-system Interaction.",

(b) The consequences of this part as to requirements for the contents (components, structure) of a hospital information system. This intention takes shape as follows: (1) Characteristics of data and their use in a hospital are considered including sensitivity, poor standardisation, high availability and long term storage required, incompleteness. (2) An outline is given of which part a HIS might play in this context and how a HIS can achieve this. Quantitative as well as qualitative improvements are described to be realised by checking the input, fast accessibility, improved standardisation, improved exchange of data, improvement of coordination of activities in the hospital. The concept of integration is shortly described. The logical structure of most HISs is introduced: a central databank with a huge storage capacity, accessible for authorised users by means of various application-packages (software) and a large number of terminals (hardware). (3) As an example of an operational HIS, the Leiden University Hospital HIS is described. The following subjects are covered: technical form (hardware, availability for the users), organisation, the applications, the use of the system, costs and benefits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Existing hospital information systems with simple statistical functions cannot meet current management needs. It is well known that hospital resources are distributed with private property rights among hospitals, such as in the case of the regional coordination of medical services. In this study, to integrate and make full use of medical data effectively, we propose a data warehouse modeling method for the hospital information system. The method can also be employed for a distributed-hospital medical service system. To ensure that hospital information supports the diverse needs of health care, the framework of the hospital information system has three layers: datacenter layer, system-function layer, and user-interface layer. This paper discusses the role of a data warehouse management system in handling hospital information from the establishment of the data theme to the design of a data model to the establishment of a data warehouse. Online analytical processing tools assist user-friendly multidimensional analysis from a number of different angles to extract the required data and information. Use of the data warehouse improves online analytical processing and mitigates deficiencies in the decision support system. The hospital information system based on a data warehouse effectively employs statistical analysis and data mining technology to handle massive quantities of historical data, and summarizes from clinical and hospital information for decision making. This paper proposes the use of a data warehouse for a hospital information system, specifically a data warehouse for the theme of hospital information to determine latitude, modeling and so on. The processing of patient information is given as an example that demonstrates the usefulness of this method in the case of hospital information management. Data warehouse technology is an evolving technology, and more and more decision support information extracted by data mining and with decision-making technology is required for further research.",

    "abstract": "In the Americas, leishmaniasis is endemic in 18 countries, and from 2001 through 2015, 17 countries reported 843,931 cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and 12 countries reported 52,176 cases of visceral leishmaniasis. A Regional Information System (SisLeish) was created in order to provide knowledge of the distribution and tendency of this disease to analyze and monitor the leishmaniasis status. This article analyses the performance and progress of SisLeish from 2012-2015. The performance of SisLeish was evaluated by country adhesion, data completeness and delay in entering the data, and also by the SWOT technique. Furthermore, we outlined the structure and modus operandi of the system and indicators utilized. In 2012, only 18% of the countries entered the data in SisLeish before the deadline, where 66.7% and 50% of the countries with autochthonous CL/ML and VL reported their cases to the system, respectively. Whereas in 2015, 59% of the countries reached the deadline, where 94.4% and 58.3% of the countries reported their CL/ML and VL data, respectively. Regarding data completeness, there was great progress for different variables since its launch, such as gender, which had an approximately 100% improvement from 2012 to 2015. The SWOT analysis of SisLeish showed 12 strengths, 11 opportunities, seven weaknesses and six threats. From 2012-2015 there has been an improvement in the adhesion, quality and data completeness, showing the effort of the majority of the countries to enhance their national database. The SWOT analysis demonstrated that strengths and opportunities exceed weaknesses and threats; however, it highlighted the system frailties and challenges that need to be addressed. Furthermore, it has stimulated several National Programs to advance their surveillance system. Therefore, SisLeish has become an essential tool to prioritize areas, assist in decision-making processes, and to guide surveillance and control actions.",

This paper first describes the comprehensive healthcare information systems used in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and then presents a service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based healthcare information system (HIS) based on the service standard HL7. The proposed architecture focuses on system scalability, in terms of both hardware and software. Moreover, we describe how scalability is implemented in rightsizing, service groups, databases, and hardware scalability. Although SOA-based systems sometimes display poor performance, through a performance evaluation of our HIS based on SOA, the average response time for outpatient, inpatient, and emergency HL7Central systems are 0.035, 0.04, and 0.036 s, respectively. The outpatient, inpatient, and emergency WebUI average response times are 0.79, 1.25, and 0.82 s. The scalability of the rightsizing project and our evaluation results show that the SOA HIS we propose provides evidence that SOA can provide system scalability and sustainability in a highly demanding healthcare information system.",

All reviews examined showed variability in results in accordance with the variability of interventions and target populations. We have found different areas for improvement for RHISs according to the three determinants of the PRISM framework that influence the configuration of RHISs: technical, organizational, or behavioral elements. (4) Conclusions: RHIS interventions in the European region are promising. However, new global and international strategies and the development of tools and mechanisms should be promoted to highly integrate platforms among European countries.",

International collaboration projects that are integrated with Sağlık-Net are also briefly summarized. The authors provide a survey of the some of the major healthcare IT infrastructures in Turkey. Sağlık-Net has two main components: the National Health Information System (NHIS) and the Family Medicine Information System (FMIS). The NHIS is a nation-wide infrastructure for sharing patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs). So far, EHRs of 78.9 million people have been created in the NHIS. Similarly, family medicine is operational in the whole country via FMIS. Centralized Hospital Appointment System enables the citizens to easily make appointments in healthcare providers. Basic Health Statistics Module is used for collecting information about the health status, risks and indicators across the country. Core Resources Management System speeds up the flow of information between the headquarters and Provincial Health Directorates. The e-prescription system is linked with Sağlık-Net and seamlessly integrated with the healthcare provider information systems. Finally, Turkey is involved in several international projects for experience sharing and disseminating national developments. With the introduction of the \"Health Transformation Program\" in 2003, a number of successful healthcare IT infrastructures have been developed in Turkey. Currently, work is going on to enhance and further improve their functionality.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases pose a great danger to public health internationally. The outbreak of SARS has exposed China's fragile public health system and its limited ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner. In order to strengthen its capability of responding to future public health emergencies, China is developing a public health emergency response information system (PHERIS) to facilitate disease surveillance, detection, reporting, and response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ongoing development of China's PHERIS. This paper analyzes the problems of China's existing public health system and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both technical and managerial aspects.",

    "abstract": "The senescence of a clinical information system is more likely to have administrative than technical bases. Supporting this claim is a case study of one aging oncology information system. The case study is qualitative, as behooves the subject matter. Content analysis of several documents suggests that the change in job description of the data coordinator led to a workflow breakdown. Next, twenty-two individuals were interviewed. Notes from the interviews were coded, and the resulting patterns led to partial support for the workflow breakdown conjecture, refutation of the hypothesis that users disliked the character-based, human-computer interface, support of the conjecture that political rather than technical factors drive the usage patterns of the system, and evidence that 'political' activity will determine the future of the information system. A stakeholder matrix is proposed that addresses administrative concerns. Also, the issue of the uniqueness of any oncology clinical information system is linked to the plans for this legacy system.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new database system for forensic autopsies, called the Legal Medicine Information System, using the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Operational Data Model (ODM). This system comprises two subsystems, namely the Institutional Database System (IDS) located in each institute and containing personal information, and the Central Anonymous Database System (CADS) located in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Center containing only anonymous information. CDISC ODM is used as the data transfer protocol between the two subsystems. Using the IDS, forensic pathologists and other staff can register and search for institutional autopsy information, print death certificates, and extract data for statistical analysis. They can also submit anonymous autopsy information to the CADS semi-automatically. This reduces the burden of double data entry, the time-lag of central data collection, and anxiety regarding legal and ethical issues. Using the CADS, various studies on the causes of death can be conducted quickly and easily, and the results can be used to prevent similar accidents, diseases, and abuse.",

    "title": "Dealing with multi-source and multi-scale information in plant phenomics: the ontology-driven Phenotyping Hybrid Information System.",
    "abstract": "Phenomic datasets need to be accessible to the scientific community. Their reanalysis requires tracing relevant information on thousands of plants, sensors and events. The open-source Phenotyping Hybrid Information System (PHIS) is proposed for plant phenotyping experiments in various categories of installations (field, glasshouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. For instance, the genotype is declared for a plant or plot and is associated with all objects related to it. Events such as successive plant positions, anomalies and annotations are associated with objects so they can be easily retrieved. Its ontology-driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It interoperates with external resources via web services, thereby allowing data integration into other systems; for example, modelling platforms or external databases. It has the potential for rapid diffusion because of its ability to integrate, manage and visualize multi-source and multi-scale data, but also because it is based on 10 yr of trial and error in our groups.",

Studies in the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO databases were then reviewed. The articles were characterized according to journal of publication, location and period of the study, evaluation parameters, methodology and main results. A total of thirteen articles were reviewed. Eight studies analyzed coverage, four assessed completeness and seven evaluated reliability. Coverage higher than 90% was presented in the majority of the studies, indicating its viability for the calculation of indicators. However, the under-reporting of births in SINASC prevailed with variation between 75.8% and 99.5%. The mother's educational level, number of prior childbirths and frequency of prenatal visits were the variables that led to greater inconsistency. For its part, the parity variable was the one that led to greater incompleteness. In conclusion, the development of studies to find new ways of assessing SINASC is highlighted as a privileged strategy for the enhancement of the quality of the system.",

After reconciliation for duplicates, 1276 HIS studies were arrived at as the non-overlapping corpus. On the basis of a subset of 287 controlled HIS studies, there is some evidence for improved quality of care, but in varying degrees across topic areas. For instance, 31/43 (72%) controlled HIS studies had positive results using preventive care reminders, mostly through guideline adherence such as immunization and health screening. Key factors that influence HIS success included having in-house systems, developers as users, integrated decision support and benchmark practices, and addressing such contextual issues as provider knowledge and perception, incentives, and legislation/policy.",

Study participants were clinical professionals with system usage experience who work at one medical center. Results indicated that technology-individual fit is the factor that most strongly influences usage, followed respectively by task-technology fit and organization readiness. Therefore, strategies designed to implement mobile nursing information systems should focus greater effort on fitting the system to system users by making these systems easy to learn and use, and training easy to complete. System functions should not only facilitate accomplishment of daily clinical tasks such as quickly obtaining information and accurate data but also be portable and provide a user-friendly, easy-to-operate interface. Organizational readiness, the commitment and support of top management, and nursing staff willingness to learn and use the new system are also important factors that influence system usage.",

    "abstract": "IHE has defined more than 200 integration profiles in order to improve the interoperability of application systems in healthcare. These profiles describe how standards should be used in particular use cases. These profiles are very helpful but their correct use is challenging, if the user is not familiar to the specifications. Therefore, inexperienced modelers of information systems quickly lose track of existing IHE profiles. In addition, the users of these profiles are often not aware of rules that are defined within these profiles and of dependencies that exist between the profiles. There are also modelers that do not notice the differences between the implemented actors, because they do not know the optional capabilities of some actors. The aim of this paper is therefore to describe a concept how modelers of information systems can be supported in the selection and use of IHE profiles and how this concept was prototypically implemented in the \"Three-layer Graph-based meta model\" modeling tool (3LGM2 Tool). The described modeling process consists of the following steps that can be looped: defining the use case, choosing suitable integration profiles, choosing actors and their options and assigning them to application systems, checking for required actor groupings and modeling transactions. Most of these steps were implemented in the 3LGM2 Tool. Further implementation effort and evaluation of our approach by inexperienced users is needed. But after that our tool should be a valuable tool for modelers planning healthcare information system architectures, in particular those based on IHE.",

    "abstract": "A routine health information system is one of the essential components of a health system. Interventions to improve routine health information system data quality and use for decision-making in low- and middle-income countries differ in design, methods, and scope. There have been limited efforts to synthesise the knowledge across the currently available intervention studies. Thus, this scoping review synthesised published results from interventions that aimed at improving data quality and use in routine health information systems in low- and middle-income countries. We included articles on intervention studies that aimed to improve data quality and use within routine health information systems in low- and middle-income countries, published in English from January 2008 to February 2020. We searched the literature in the databases Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Global Health. After a meticulous screening, we identified 20 articles on data quality and 16 on data use. We prepared and presented the results as a narrative. Most of the studies were from Sub-Saharan Africa and designed as case studies. Interventions enhancing the quality of data targeted health facilities and staff within districts, and district health managers for improved data use. Combinations of technology enhancement along with capacity building activities, and data quality assessment and feedback system were found useful in improving data quality. Interventions facilitating data availability combined with technology enhancement increased the use of data for planning. The studies in this scoping review showed that a combination of interventions, addressing both behavioural and technical factors, improved data quality and use. Interventions addressing organisational factors were non-existent, but these factors were reported to pose challenges to the implementation and performance of reported interventions.",

    "abstract": "Maturity models assess the snapshot view of an organization and simultaneously guides the organization to advance on a road map towards ultimate levels of maturity. The health industry has recently embraced maturity models as a tool to improve the management of health information systems. Most electronic health information systems in Sri Lanka need assessment and monitoring and can benefit vastly by adopting maturity models. This study was conducted to modify and adopt a maturity model for public health institutions in Sri Lanka. A review of the literature was done to identify a suitable model to measure the maturity of the public health information system implementations. A Modified Delphi study was then carried out with six experts to adapt the selected maturity tool, Public Health Information Technology (PHIT) maturity index, to the Sri Lankan context. Necessary modifications to the PHIT tool were done according to the comments gathered in the Modified Delphi rounds, and the validity of the tool was established. Finally, Key Informant Interviews were carried out with nine interviewees to qualitatively validate the instrument. The Public Health Information Technology maturity index developed by the University of Maryland, USA, was modified to suit the Sri Lankan context. Comments from the experts were accommodated during the initial rounds of the Modified Delphi study. It further derived the following values, indicating excellent content validity: I-CVI > 0.8 for 57 total items, S-CVI/Avg = 0.988, S-CVI/UA = 0.929 and Free-marginal kappa = 0.95. Modified and validated PHIT tool can be used to measure the maturity of public health institutions in similar contexts.",

The four themes emerged from data analysis included: a) methods of recording cancer data in the hospitals, b) required cancer data in different departments, c) comprehensive cancer care documentation, and d) required functions of an oncology information system. According to the results, currently, electronic documentation is less frequently used for cancer patients. Therefore, an extensive effort is needed to identify users' requirements before designing and implementing an oncology information system. As multidisciplinary teams are involved in cancer care, all potential users and their requirements should be taken into account. Such a system can help to collect and use cancer data effectively.",

    "abstract": "Nursing Information System (NIS) is a part of a health care information system that deals with nursing aspects, particularly the maintenance of the nursing record. The several objectives that a Nursing Information system should meet in order to succeed its aims, cover the users' needs and operate properly are described. The functions of such systems, which combine with the basic tasks of the nursing care process, are examined. As Nursing Information System is part of the health care and hospital information system, the different strategies and approaches for designing and developing Hospital Information Systems followed from the decade of 1970 until the recent decade of 1990, are presented. The three main approaches followed were the \"centralized approach\", the \"departmental approach\", and the \"distributed approach\". The advantages and drawbacks of each different approach are examined. For the implementation or upgrade of Nursing Information System a NIS committee comprised by different health care professionals, is necessary to be formed. The implementation and upgrade of a Nursing Information System follows some specific phases. These steps, include planning phase, analysis phase, design phase, development phase, implementation phase, and upgrade phase. A paragraph at the end of this chapter summarizes the future trends of Nursing Information Systems.",
